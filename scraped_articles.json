It\u2019s multiplatform and really good at adapting as media ecosystems change.\u201d\n\nIn May, Facebook removed a cluster of five pages, 20 Facebook accounts and six groups affiliated with QAnon, saying they had violated its policy against coordinated inauthentic behavior.\n\nAfter years of taking a hands-off approach to content moderation, Twitter has acted more aggressively in recent months to stem the flood of abuse and harassment on its platform.\n\nSince it became a venue for disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter has cracked down on content that spreads false information or encourages harassment. In February, it introduced a ban against manipulated photos and videos, a popular method of tricking viewers and spreading disinformation. And in May, it began labeling some of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets, saying they contained false information or promoted violence.\n\nTwitter\u2019s aggressive enforcement actions have put it on a collision course with Mr. Trump, who has said that Twitter is unfairly silencing conservative voices and has encouraged regulators to crack down on the service. While the QAnon ban was applauded in many circles, some conservatives said Twitter\u2019s move was further evidence that the company unevenly enforced its rules against Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe political attention has added to Twitter\u2019s headaches. A wide-ranging hack last week compromised the Twitter accounts of Democratic political figures, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Barack Obama. Twitter also faces concerns that advertisers are tightening spending during the coronavirus pandemic, and is expected to report its second-quarter earnings this week.\n\nMore than two years after QAnon emerged from the troll-infested corners of the internet, supporters of the movement, which the F.B.I. has labeled a potential domestic terrorism threat, are trickling into the mainstream of the Republican Party. Precisely how many candidates, mostly Republicans, are running under the QAnon banner is unclear.

Passengers who need an exemption from the rule are asked to contact United ahead of time or speak to one of the airline's representatives at the airport.\n\nCustomers who fail to abide by the requirement will receive a verbal reminder, followed by a written one. Those who still refuse to wear a face covering risk being barred from future flights.\n\nThe policy was developed with help from the Cleveland Clinic, which United has partnered with for guidance on crafting health and safety policies.\n\nOn Tuesday, United said that revenue dropped 87 percent, to $1.5 billion, in the second quarter compared to last year, in line with the 88 percent decline Delta Air Lines reported last week.\n\nPassenger travel declined dramatically in March and April, falling as much as 96 percent on some days compared to last year, according to federal data. Traffic had started to recover in May and June, but has faltered in recent weeks as infections and travel restrictions spread nationwide.\n\nMr. Kirby joined the chief executives of American Airlines, Lufthansa Group and International Airlines Group in asking the United States and European Union to restore trans-Atlantic travel and to test passengers for the coronavirus.\n\nInternational flights are more lucrative than domestic ones and the flights between Europe and the United States are among the most valuable for airlines.

Workers cooped up in a two-bedroom in Long Island City, Queens, might prefer moving to the suburbs or even farther away, and save on rent.\n\nMr. Glaeser and colleagues from Harvard and the University of Illinois studied surveys tracking companies that allowed their employees to work from home at least part of the time since March. Over one-half of large businesses and over one-third of small ones didn\u2019t detect any productivity loss.

Most of these workers are among the more highly educated and well paid.\n\nWill they stay in the city if they don\u2019t need to go to the office more than a couple of times a week? Erik Hurst, an economist at the University of Chicago, argues that people will always seek the kind of social contact that cities provide. But what if their employers stop paying enough to support the urban lifestyle? Young families might flee to the suburbs sooner, especially if a more austere new urban economy can no longer support the ecosystem of restaurants and theaters that made city life attractive.\n\nThe overall economy might be less productive, having lost some of the benefits of social connection. But as long as the hit is not too severe, employers might be better off, paying lower wages and saving on office space. And workers might prefer a state of the world with somewhat lower wages and no commute.\n\nMunicipal governments in superstar cities might have a tough time doing their job as their tax base shrinks.

But they have barely made a dent, at least in the United States. Sales of the Jaguar I-Pace, an electric sport utility vehicle similar to the Tesla Model Y, have totaled just over 1,000 this year. Porsche has reported similar sales for its electric sedan, the Taycan.\n\nAudi, which has grown steadily in the United States over the last decade, introduced an electric S.U.V., the E-tron, last year, and sales have sputtered. So far this year, Audi has sold just under 2,900. In many states, the car is advertised at prices 13 percent or more below its list price \u2014 unusual for an Audi.\n\n\u201cObviously from the numbers we\u2019re seeing, these cars aren\u2019t setting the world on fire,\u201d said Karl Brauer, an independent auto analyst. \u201cIt was a mistake to think that just because these cars were on the market that people were going to buy them.\u201d", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/business/tesla-electric-car-audi-polestar.html", "author": ["Neal E.

Still, many cruise lines are delaying their relaunch date even further. Cunard is paused until November. Carnival Cruise Line has already canceled some sailings into 2021.\n\nSo, yes, because cruising is a mess right now, it\u2019s not totally unreasonable to be anxious about what next spring will look like.\n\nTo win back consumer confidence, maintain cash flow and assure the safety of future passengers and crew members, the cruising industry needs to take massive action. Companies say they are hammering out health protocols and testing upgrades like ultraviolet technologies and H.V.A.C. systems. Meanwhile, docked ships and blank passenger manifests have created a revenue crunch, and certain lines are downsizing their fleets accordingly. Schedules continue to change; as a result, customer-service channels are churning in overdrive.\n\nt\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen lines cancel their sailings in small batches \u2014 usually a couple of months at a time \u2014 in an effort to process fewer cancellations at once, but they\u2019re still dealing with far more booking adjustments than they\u2019re used to en masse,\u201d said Colleen McDaniel, the editor in chief of Cruise Critic, a major cruise-planning website.\n\nPerhaps fitting for an industry that\u2019s so in flux, reader complaints about cruise refunds and credits have felt especially bizarre. One woman was told by a cruise line customer-service representative that in order to get a refund, she would need to stop posting complaints about the company on Twitter. (She didn\u2019t; that\u2019s how I found her.) Another was asked to prepay for a cruise a full 33 months in advance \u2014 highly unusual for a system that runs on deposits and final payments.

Foreign direct investment into the United States \u2014 which measures spending from internationally owned companies to start, expand or acquire American businesses \u2014 sank drastically last year, to its lowest recorded level since 2006.\n\nForeign-owned companies invested about half as much in the United States in 2019 as they did in 2016, the year before Mr. Trump took office. After increasing in the first two years of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, the number of manufacturing jobs flatlined last year and fell sharply with the pandemic. As of June, there were nearly 300,000 fewer factory jobs in the United States than there were when Mr. Trump was inaugurated.\n\nFor all the president\u2019s criticisms of global supply chains, the economic incentive to outsource still prevails. While his trade policy has made doing business abroad, particularly in China, more uncertain and costly, higher wages in the United States and the lure of foreign markets mean that most global businesses are choosing to remain global. Most firms that shifted out of China to avoid the crossfire of the trade war moved to other low-cost countries, like Vietnam and Mexico. Other companies say China is a growth market they cannot afford to lose.\n\nAnd while the pandemic has prompted a broader reassessment of the risks of global supply chains, it has also brought about the deepest economic contraction in generations, battering companies\u2019 finances and forcing them to cut back on workers. Executives are deeply uncertain what demand for their products will look like in the coming months and years \u2014 hardly the environment to encourage big investments in new American factories.\n\nThe furniture maker La-Z-Boy is one example. The company shifted its production out of China to Vietnam last year to bypass Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, according to tracking by Panjiva, a research firm. But on a June 24 earnings call, Kurt L. Darrow, La-Z-Boy\u2019s chief executive, announced that the economic effects of the pandemic would force the firm to make steep cuts to its work force, including in the United States.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/business/economy/coronavirus-globalization-jobs-supply-chain-china.html", "author": ["Ana Swanson", "Jim Tankersley"]}, {"title": "End of $600 Unemployment Bonus Could Push Millions Past the Brink", "text": "For people depending on the checks, that uncertainty is frustrating.\n\n\u201cI have no idea why Congress would wait until a few days before the checks are going to run out,\u201d said Jacob Perlman, a benefits recipient in Chicago. \u201cThis should have been done a month ago.\u201d\n\nMr. Perlman, 26, earned $12 an hour as a housekeeper at a fitness club, making him one of the millions of Americans earning more on unemployment than they had on the job. But he is eager to return to work.\n\n\u201cThe jobs simply are not there right now,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Perlman\u2019s regular benefits from the state of Illinois total $159 a week, barely enough to cover his $500 share of the monthly rent, let alone food or other expenses. So he is already trying to save as much as possible.\n\nDecisions like Mr. Perlman\u2019s to curtail spending even before the benefits expire, multiplied across millions of households, are a sort of uncertainty tax on the broader economy, damping the stimulative effect of the payments.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are on the precipice of financial disaster here,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former Federal Reserve official who is an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cWe may think that the odds are that Congress will come to a reasonable conclusion. But for a person who is on the precipice of financial disaster, it\u2019s very low comfort to be told, \u2018You know, I think there\u2019s a 70 percent chance that this is going to work out fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe risk is particularly acute for Black and Latino workers, who have been disproportionately affected by job losses and are less likely to have savings or other assets to fall back on. A recent working paper from researchers at the University of Chicago and the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that Black and Latino households cut spending by far more than white households when their income drops.\n\n\u201cWhen 30 percent of your population has no wealth, this has real implications,\u201d said William E. Spriggs, a Howard University professor and the chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a piggy bank. This is it.

Takedown Targets QAnon Accounts", "text": "\u201cThese accounts amplify and enable networked harassment on a level that\u2019s clearly against the Twitter terms of service,\u201d Ms. Marwick said. \u201cBut this won\u2019t stop QAnon from operating. It\u2019s multiplatform and really good at adapting as media ecosystems change.\u201d\n\nIn May, Facebook removed a cluster of five pages, 20 Facebook accounts and six groups affiliated with QAnon, saying they had violated its policy against coordinated inauthentic behavior.\n\nAfter years of taking a hands-off approach to content moderation, Twitter has acted more aggressively in recent months to stem the flood of abuse and harassment on its platform.\n\nSince it became a venue for disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter has cracked down on content that spreads false information or encourages harassment. In February, it introduced a ban against manipulated photos and videos, a popular method of tricking viewers and spreading disinformation. And in May, it began labeling some of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets, saying they contained false information or promoted violence.\n\nTwitter\u2019s aggressive enforcement actions have put it on a collision course with Mr. Trump, who has said that Twitter is unfairly silencing conservative voices and has encouraged regulators to crack down on the service. While the QAnon ban was applauded in many circles, some conservatives said Twitter\u2019s move was further evidence that the company unevenly enforced its rules against Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe political attention has added to Twitter\u2019s headaches. A wide-ranging hack last week compromised the Twitter accounts of Democratic political figures, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Barack Obama.

So when anxious consumers were stocking up on beans and pasta, they were also grabbing workbooks, paperbacks and novels \u2014 and the book sales at those stores shot up.\n\n\u201cThey sell groceries, they sell toilet paper, they sell everything people need during this time, and they\u2019re open,\u201d said Suzanne Herz, the publisher of Vintage/Anchor. \u201cIf you\u2019re in there and you\u2019re doing your big shop and you walk down the aisle and go, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re bored, and we need a book or a puzzle.\u2019 There it is.\u201d\n\nBig box stores do not generally break out how much they sell of particular products, but people across the publishing industry say that sales increased at these stores significantly, with perhaps the greatest bump at Target.

My Ship Is Supposedly Still Sailing, and I Don\u2019t Want to Be On Board", "text": "Although certain small ships have resumed operations this summer, most ocean vessels that sail to or from United States ports are suspended through Sept. 30, according to the C.D.C.\u2019s extended No Sail Order. Still, many cruise lines are delaying their relaunch date even further. Cunard is paused until November. Carnival Cruise Line has already canceled some sailings into 2021.\n\nSo, yes, because cruising is a mess right now, it\u2019s not totally unreasonable to be anxious about what next spring will look like.\n\nTo win back consumer confidence, maintain cash flow and assure the safety of future passengers and crew members, the cruising industry needs to take massive action. Companies say they are hammering out health protocols and testing upgrades like ultraviolet technologies and H.V.A.C. systems. Meanwhile, docked ships and blank passenger manifests have created a revenue crunch, and certain lines are downsizing their fleets accordingly. Schedules continue to change; as a result, customer-service channels are churning in overdrive.\n\nt\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen lines cancel their sailings in small batches \u2014 usually a couple of months at a time \u2014 in an effort to process fewer cancellations at once, but they\u2019re still dealing with far more booking adjustments than they\u2019re used to en masse,\u201d said Colleen McDaniel, the editor in chief of Cruise Critic, a major cruise-planning website.\n\nPerhaps fitting for an industry that\u2019s so in flux, reader complaints about cruise refunds and credits have felt especially bizarre. One woman was told by a cruise line customer-service representative that in order to get a refund, she would need to stop posting complaints about the company on Twitter. (She didn\u2019t; that\u2019s how I found her.) Another was asked to prepay for a cruise a full 33 months in advance \u2014 highly unusual for a system that runs on deposits and final payments. (One cruise-editor friend, upon hearing these anecdotes, deemed them a good \u201calarm for the industry\u201d about how customer-service reps are trained.)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/travel/virus-cruise-refunds.html", "author": ["Sarah Firshein"]}, {"title": "The Pandemic Isn\u2019t Bringing Back Factory Jobs, at Least Not Yet", "text": "But those arguments have yet to result in a wave of factories returning to the United States. Foreign direct investment into the United States \u2014 which measures spending from internationally owned companies to start, expand or acquire American businesses \u2014 sank drastically last year, to its lowest recorded level since 2006.\n\nForeign-owned companies invested about half as much in the United States in 2019 as they did in 2016, the year before Mr. Trump took office. After increasing in the first two years of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, the number of manufacturing jobs flatlined last year and fell sharply with the pandemic. As of June, there were nearly 300,000 fewer factory jobs in the United States than there were when Mr. Trump was inaugurated.\n\nFor all the president\u2019s criticisms of global supply chains, the economic incentive to outsource still prevails. While his trade policy has made doing business abroad, particularly in China, more uncertain and costly, higher wages in the United States and the lure of foreign markets mean that most global businesses are choosing to remain global. Most firms that shifted out of China to avoid the crossfire of the trade war moved to other low-cost countries, like Vietnam and Mexico. Other companies say China is a growth market they cannot afford to lose.\n\nAnd while the pandemic has prompted a broader reassessment of the risks of global supply chains, it has also brought about the deepest economic contraction in generations, battering companies\u2019 finances and forcing them to cut back on workers. Executives are deeply uncertain what demand for their products will look like in the coming months and years \u2014 hardly the environment to encourage big investments in new American factories.\n\nThe furniture maker La-Z-Boy is one example. The company shifted its production out of China to Vietnam last year to bypass Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, according to tracking by Panjiva, a research firm. But on a June 24 earnings call, Kurt L. Darrow, La-Z-Boy\u2019s chief executive, announced that the economic effects of the pandemic would force the firm to make steep cuts to its work force, including in the United States.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/business/economy/coronavirus-globalization-jobs-supply-chain-china.html", "author": ["Ana Swanson", "Jim Tankersley"]}, {"title": "End of $600 Unemployment Bonus Could Push Millions Past the Brink", "text": "For people depending on the checks, that uncertainty is frustrating.\n\n\u201cI have no idea why Congress would wait until a few days before the checks are going to run out,\u201d said Jacob Perlman, a benefits recipient in Chicago. \u201cThis should have been done a month ago.\u201d\n\nMr. Perlman, 26, earned $12 an hour as a housekeeper at a fitness club, making him one of the millions of Americans earning more on unemployment than they had on the job. But he is eager to return to work.\n\n\u201cThe jobs simply are not there right now,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Perlman\u2019s regular benefits from the state of Illinois total $159 a week, barely enough to cover his $500 share of the monthly rent, let alone food or other expenses. So he is already trying to save as much as possible.\n\nDecisions like Mr. Perlman\u2019s to curtail spending even before the benefits expire, multiplied across millions of households, are a sort of uncertainty tax on the broader economy, damping the stimulative effect of the payments.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are on the precipice of financial disaster here,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former Federal Reserve official who is an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cWe may think that the odds are that Congress will come to a reasonable conclusion. But for a person who is on the precipice of financial disaster, it\u2019s very low comfort to be told, \u2018You know, I think there\u2019s a 70 percent chance that this is going to work out fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe risk is particularly acute for Black and Latino workers, who have been disproportionately affected by job losses and are less likely to have savings or other assets to fall back on. A recent working paper from researchers at the University of Chicago and the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that Black and Latino households cut spending by far more than white households when their income drops.\n\n\u201cWhen 30 percent of your population has no wealth, this has real implications,\u201d said William E. Spriggs, a Howard University professor and the chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a piggy bank. This is it.

"Twitter Takedown Targets QAnon Accounts", "text": "\u201cThese accounts amplify and enable networked harassment on a level that\u2019s clearly against the Twitter terms of service,\u201d Ms. Marwick said. \u201cBut this won\u2019t stop QAnon from operating. It\u2019s multiplatform and really good at adapting as media ecosystems change.\u201d\n\nIn May, Facebook removed a cluster of five pages, 20 Facebook accounts and six groups affiliated with QAnon, saying they had violated its policy against coordinated inauthentic behavior.\n\nAfter years of taking a hands-off approach to content moderation, Twitter has acted more aggressively in recent months to stem the flood of abuse and harassment on its platform.\n\nSince it became a venue for disinformation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Twitter has cracked down on content that spreads false information or encourages harassment. In February, it introduced a ban against manipulated photos and videos, a popular method of tricking viewers and spreading disinformation. And in May, it began labeling some of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets, saying they contained false information or promoted violence.\n\nTwitter\u2019s aggressive enforcement actions have put it on a collision course with Mr. Trump, who has said that Twitter is unfairly silencing conservative voices and has encouraged regulators to crack down on the service. While the QAnon ban was applauded in many circles, some conservatives said Twitter\u2019s move was further evidence that the company unevenly enforced its rules against Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe political attention has added to Twitter\u2019s headaches. A wide-ranging hack last week compromised the Twitter accounts of Democratic political figures, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Barack Obama.

So when anxious consumers were stocking up on beans and pasta, they were also grabbing workbooks, paperbacks and novels \u2014 and the book sales at those stores shot up.\n\n\u201cThey sell groceries, they sell toilet paper, they sell everything people need during this time, and they\u2019re open,\u201d said Suzanne Herz, the publisher of Vintage/Anchor. \u201cIf you\u2019re in there and you\u2019re doing your big shop and you walk down the aisle and go, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re bored, and we need a book or a puzzle.\u2019 There it is.\u201d\n\nBig box stores do not generally break out how much they sell of particular products, but people across the publishing industry say that sales increased at these stores significantly, with perhaps the greatest bump at Target.

My Ship Is Supposedly Still Sailing, and I Don\u2019t Want to Be On Board", "text": "Although certain small ships have resumed operations this summer, most ocean vessels that sail to or from United States ports are suspended through Sept. 30, according to the C.D.C.\u2019s extended No Sail Order. Still, many cruise lines are delaying their relaunch date even further. Cunard is paused until November. Carnival Cruise Line has already canceled some sailings into 2021.\n\nSo, yes, because cruising is a mess right now, it\u2019s not totally unreasonable to be anxious about what next spring will look like.\n\nTo win back consumer confidence, maintain cash flow and assure the safety of future passengers and crew members, the cruising industry needs to take massive action. Companies say they are hammering out health protocols and testing upgrades like ultraviolet technologies and H.V.A.C. systems. Meanwhile, docked ships and blank passenger manifests have created a revenue crunch, and certain lines are downsizing their fleets accordingly. Schedules continue to change; as a result, customer-service channels are churning in overdrive.\n\nt\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen lines cancel their sailings in small batches \u2014 usually a couple of months at a time \u2014 in an effort to process fewer cancellations at once, but they\u2019re still dealing with far more booking adjustments than they\u2019re used to en masse,\u201d said Colleen McDaniel, the editor in chief of Cruise Critic, a major cruise-planning website.\n\nPerhaps fitting for an industry that\u2019s so in flux, reader complaints about cruise refunds and credits have felt especially bizarre. One woman was told by a cruise line customer-service representative that in order to get a refund, she would need to stop posting complaints about the company on Twitter. (She didn\u2019t; that\u2019s how I found her.) Another was asked to prepay for a cruise a full 33 months in advance \u2014 highly unusual for a system that runs on deposits and final payments. (One cruise-editor friend, upon hearing these anecdotes, deemed them a good \u201calarm for the industry\u201d about how customer-service reps are trained.)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/travel/virus-cruise-refunds.html", "author": ["Sarah Firshein"]}, {"title": "The Pandemic Isn\u2019t Bringing Back Factory Jobs, at Least Not Yet", "text": "But those arguments have yet to result in a wave of factories returning to the United States. Foreign direct investment into the United States \u2014 which measures spending from internationally owned companies to start, expand or acquire American businesses \u2014 sank drastically last year, to its lowest recorded level since 2006.\n\nForeign-owned companies invested about half as much in the United States in 2019 as they did in 2016, the year before Mr. Trump took office. After increasing in the first two years of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, the number of manufacturing jobs flatlined last year and fell sharply with the pandemic. As of June, there were nearly 300,000 fewer factory jobs in the United States than there were when Mr. Trump was inaugurated.\n\nFor all the president\u2019s criticisms of global supply chains, the economic incentive to outsource still prevails. While his trade policy has made doing business abroad, particularly in China, more uncertain and costly, higher wages in the United States and the lure of foreign markets mean that most global businesses are choosing to remain global. Most firms that shifted out of China to avoid the crossfire of the trade war moved to other low-cost countries, like Vietnam and Mexico. Other companies say China is a growth market they cannot afford to lose.\n\nAnd while the pandemic has prompted a broader reassessment of the risks of global supply chains, it has also brought about the deepest economic contraction in generations, battering companies\u2019 finances and forcing them to cut back on workers. Executives are deeply uncertain what demand for their products will look like in the coming months and years \u2014 hardly the environment to encourage big investments in new American factories.\n\nThe furniture maker La-Z-Boy is one example. The company shifted its production out of China to Vietnam last year to bypass Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, according to tracking by Panjiva, a research firm. But on a June 24 earnings call, Kurt L. Darrow, La-Z-Boy\u2019s chief executive, announced that the economic effects of the pandemic would force the firm to make steep cuts to its work force, including in the United States.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/business/economy/coronavirus-globalization-jobs-supply-chain-china.html", "author": ["Ana Swanson", "Jim Tankersley"]}, {"title": "End of $600 Unemployment Bonus Could Push Millions Past the Brink", "text": "For people depending on the checks, that uncertainty is frustrating.\n\n\u201cI have no idea why Congress would wait until a few days before the checks are going to run out,\u201d said Jacob Perlman, a benefits recipient in Chicago. \u201cThis should have been done a month ago.\u201d\n\nMr. Perlman, 26, earned $12 an hour as a housekeeper at a fitness club, making him one of the millions of Americans earning more on unemployment than they had on the job. But he is eager to return to work.\n\n\u201cThe jobs simply are not there right now,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Perlman\u2019s regular benefits from the state of Illinois total $159 a week, barely enough to cover his $500 share of the monthly rent, let alone food or other expenses. So he is already trying to save as much as possible.\n\nDecisions like Mr. Perlman\u2019s to curtail spending even before the benefits expire, multiplied across millions of households, are a sort of uncertainty tax on the broader economy, damping the stimulative effect of the payments.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are on the precipice of financial disaster here,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former Federal Reserve official who is an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cWe may think that the odds are that Congress will come to a reasonable conclusion. But for a person who is on the precipice of financial disaster, it\u2019s very low comfort to be told, \u2018You know, I think there\u2019s a 70 percent chance that this is going to work out fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe risk is particularly acute for Black and Latino workers, who have been disproportionately affected by job losses and are less likely to have savings or other assets to fall back on. A recent working paper from researchers at the University of Chicago and the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that Black and Latino households cut spending by far more than white households when their income drops.\n\n\u201cWhen 30 percent of your population has no wealth, this has real implications,\u201d said William E. Spriggs, a Howard University professor and the chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a piggy bank. This is it.

While N95 masks are made entirely from a special material that filters out airborne droplets and fluids that could contain the Covid-19 virus, the new MIT mask is made from silicone, with slots for just two small, disposable disks of the N95 material (which serve as filters). That means the masks themselves can be quickly and easily sterilized and reused, and though the small filters must be thrown out, each mask requires much less N95 material.\n\nCalled the iMASC, which stands for Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, Conformable, this design could help solve shortage issues.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/mit-researchers-designed-reusable-n95-face-mask-for-healthcare-workers.html", "author": ["Cory Stieg"]}, {"title": "Ford unveils electric Mustang Mach-E race car with 1,400 horsepower", "text": "Ford Motor has developed a racing version of its upcoming all-electric Mustang Mach-E crossover with 1,400 horsepower and a top speed that's not street legal.\n\nThe company plans to use the prototype vehicle, which it's calling the Mustang Mach-E 1400, to show off the potential performance of all-electric vehicles as the new crossover begins arriving in dealerships later this year.\n\n\"It's an all-around athlete,\" Mark Rushbrook, motorsports director of Ford Performance, told CNBC.

In an interview with CNBC, Lynch said the partnership with Fanatics reach would help expand Beast Mode beyond North America.\n\n\"He's done an incredible job throughout his career while playing, also building his brand,\" Boyle added. \"We saw the opportunity to help him scale his business and reach a significantly wider range of fans across the entire globe.\"\n\n\"As we continue to evolve our business, we saw this as an opportunity to be the first time we would power a branded e-commerce site for an individual athlete, celebrity or influencer,\" Boyle told CNBC.\n\nThe agreement is the first of its kind for Fanatics, as the firm usually strikes e-commerce deals with sports leagues and clubs, not individual athletes.

The company, which operates over 250 e-commerce partners including the National Football League, PGA Tour and NASCAR, also recently extended its partnership with Nike.\n\nIn addition to rights to make Nike's NFL fan gear, Fanatics will also exclusively make Major League Baseball gear starting with the 2020 season.\n\nLynch, 34, last played for the Seahawks in the 2019 season after spending his previous two years with the then-Oakland Raiders. Asked if he's officially retired from the NFL, Lynch said: \"Until further notice.\"\n\nBoyle said the company would collaborate with Lynch on creative rollouts to build \"anticipation for new products\" if the NFL is no longer in Lynch's future. Boyle said Fanatics will use what it learns from Beast Mode to build additional models for operating personal brand sites for athletes\n\n\"This will certainly pave the way for future opportunities,\" Boyle said.\n\nLynch's former colleagues in the NFL are still wrapping up negotiations on return to play protocols due to Covid-19. Teams are scheduled to hold training camps this week, but are still negotiating with players on pay and safety rules for the season.\n\nAsked what advice he would give younger players about returning in this current environment, Lynch said \"health first\" before telling players to \"make sure you're making the right decision for you and you're not letting nobody else influence your decision.\"\n\nHe factored in his love for the sport before admitting he would risk playing this season despite the pandemic.\n\n\"That has nothing to do with the bread (money), the fame.

Revenue beat Street forecasts as well. Earnings were down from a year ago as KeyCorp's provision for credit losses rose, but the bank said its sequential quarterly revenue rose 17% due to strength in fees.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) \u2013 Best Buy said its overall sales are up about 15% since it began reopening its stores in mid-June. The electronics store chain's online sales have more than tripled during the current quarter through July 18.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) \u2013 United Airlines reported a quarterly loss of $9.31 per share, wider than the loss of $9.02 a share that analysts had been forecasting. Revenue was above estimates. United said it burned through about $40 million per day in cash, although it expects that number to drop to about $25 million this quarter.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) \u2013 The music streaming service has struck a new long term licensing deal with Vivendi's Universal Music Group.

Adam Jeffery | CNBC\n\nThis week, Bill Ackman, through Pershing Square Holdings, is sponsoring the largest Special Purpose Acquisition Company ever raised. A SPAC, also known as blank check companies, has no commercial operations and is formed strictly to raise capital through an initial public offering for the purpose of acquiring an existing company. Pershing Square's SPAC will be called Pershing Square Tontine Holdings and will raise $4 billion by offering 200 million units at $20 per share. Additionally, Pershing Square will be acquiring between $1 billion and $3 billion of units, for a total amount of capital of up to $7 billion. However, based on Pershing Square's current assets under management, we do not expect their contribution to exceed $1.5 billion, for a total capitalization of $5.5 billion. This is the second time in its history that Pershing Square has sponsored a SPAC. Ackman will be on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Wednesday at 8:15 am to discuss the investment Pershing Square also served as co-sponsor of Justice Holdings, with Nicolas Berggruen and Martin Franklin. Justice Holdings raised approximately $1.5 billion in its initial public offering in February of 2011 (including a $458 million investment by Pershing Square). In April of 2012, Justice Holdings purchased from 3G Capital a 29% stake in Burger King Worldwide Holdings Inc. for $1.4 billion in cash, and subsequently merged with Tim Hortons, to form Restaurant Brands International. Pershing Square still remains the second-largest investor in Restaurant Brands International. As of June 30, 2020 the stock of Restaurant Brands International has generated a compound annual total return of 19% since its merger with Justice Holdings, even after losing 30% of its value during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe basic structure of a SPAC is that investors buy common stock in the IPO of a blank check company, in this case, for $20 per share. In addition to the common stock, they receive warrants as an incentive for them to invest. These warrants are generally detachable, allowing the investor to trade them as separate securities and inviting the short-term investing arbitrage world into SPACs, which often make up a significant part of the shareholder base. The SPAC sponsor will then find a company to acquire and investors will essentially have the choice of staying invested in the SPAC through the acquisition or redeeming their shares for the full amount they acquired them for. The structure of Tontine Holdings is unique on many different levels. First, each unit consists of: (i) one share of common stock, (ii) one-ninth of a redeemable warrant, exercisable at $23; and (iii) two-ninths of a warrant, exercisable at $23 provided that they are not redeemed in connection with a proposed business combination. It is this last element that is significant. The one-ninth of a warrant is detachable on day 52 and this is a normal incentive for SPAC investors. However, unlike virtually all other SPACs where all warrants are detachable, two-thirds of the warrants issued to shareholders are not detachable, discouraging the arb community and encouraging long term investors. Moreover, the investors do not even receive these two-thirds of warrants if they choose to redeem their stock prior to the closing of the acquisition, giving a significant amount of more certainty that the acquisition will close. And finally, as additional incentive to hold the securities through the closing, if a shareholder does redeem, their warrants are distributed pro rata to the shareholders who remain in the SPAC, hence the name \"Tontine\" holdings. A tontine is an investment plan devised in the 17th century whereby each investor pays an agreed sum into the fund and thereafter receives a periodic payout with that payment devolving to the other participants upon the death of an investor. But the most unique feature of this SPAC and the greatest departure from historical SPACs is the compensation terms for the SPAC sponsor, in this case Pershing Square Holdings. The normal historical SPAC sponsor will partly capitalize the operations of the SPAC by acquiring sponsor warrants giving them a participation in the upside of the company. But that is far from their main compensation. Typically, SPAC sponsors receive 20% of the shares in the SPAC for extremely nominal consideration. These founders shares compensate the sponsor regardless of whether the shares in the company appreciate or decline. For example, in a recent SPAC sponsored by Goldman Sachs, they raised $700 million at $10 per share. They paid $16 million for warrants to acquire 8 million shares at $11.50 per share and received Founders shares for 20% of the company for $5,000. On the day of the closing that $5,000 payment yielded them $140 million of stock assuming a deal closes. Another example a little older but involving a peer of Pershing Square is Third Point's 2018 sponsoring of Far Point Acquisition Corp. where it raised $500 million at $10 per share. In that situation, Third Point paid $12 million for warrants to buy 8 million shares at $11.50 per share and received its 20% of Founder shares for a nominal payment of only $25,000. So, assuming a deal closes, Third Point receives $100 million of its shareholders' investment regardless of whether the investment is successful or not. Moreover, under the Founders' shares compensation structure, Third Point and Goldman Sachs still receive tens of millions of dollars of compensation even in a failed investment that loses half of its value. In contrast, in Tontine Holdings, Pershing Square and its affiliates (including Tontine board members) are paying $67.8 million for warrants to acquire 6.21% of the company. This is much more consideration than the $16 million and $12 million that Goldman and Third Point paid and much less than the 9.1% and 12.8% of shares that Goldman and Third Point received. Moreover, Goldman and Third Point's warrants were exercisable at a 15% premium to the IPO price whereas Pershing Square's are exercisable at a 20% premium, and Pershing Square has agreed not to exercise its warrants for three years after the closing of the acquisition.\n\nWhy it's 'groundbreaking'\n\nBut this is not the really groundbreaking feature of the Tontine compensation structure. The truly remarkable departure from SPAC standard terms is that Pershing Square is not taking any founders shares. By removing this egregious compensation element, Pershing Square really shows their allegiance to their investors. Pershing Square's sole compensation for founding and capitalizing the SPAC and sourcing, negotiating and closing a $10B+ acquisition will be a 6.21% promote after the investors have already received a 20% return. To put it another way, under Pershing Square's warrant-only compensation structure, Pershing Square does not receive any compensation until after the shareholders receive a 20% return, whereas under the typical founders shares compensation structure (as illustrated by the Goldman Sachs and Third Point SPACs above), the shareholders do not see any return until after the company receives a 20% return. Furthermore, Pershing Square paid $67.8 million for these warrants, money they do not get back if a deal is not procured and closed. So, why did Pershing Square wait almost 10 years after its extremely successful Justice Holdings SPAC to do another one? The answer is market environment.\n\nWhat's different now\n\nPershing Square started working on Justice Holdings right after the financial crisis, when there was an extreme level of uncertainty in the markets. Uncertainty is the mortal enemy of IPOs \u2014 until the day of the IPO, companies are not sure what price they will get, how much money they will raise and if it will even happen during times of ultra-volatility in the markets. Pershing Square patiently waited for that market environment to repeat itself, except this time in the form of a global pandemic and a presidential election. With COVID-19 surges coming or not coming and vaccines coming or not coming depending on the day, there is too much uncertainty in the markets over the next nine months or so for companies to risk an IPO, particularly a $5 billion IPO. Isn't it much easier to go public through a SPAC where you know exactly how much you are getting for your shares and have a contractual obligation from the acquirer? Moreover, management does not have to deal with the loss of focus inherent in an IPO and all of the meetings, issues and road shows. The only uncertainty in a SPAC is if the acquirer will approve it or if its shareholders will choose to redeem instead. Well, Pershing Square's structure has taken a lot of that uncertainty away as well. The transaction will not necessarily require shareholder approval, just board approval; and the possibility of redeeming shareholders was greatly mitigated because of the Tontine-style warrants, the fact that Pershing Square will be investing over a billion dollars of its own money and because unlike most SPACs, shareholders are not looking at a 20% dilution from Founders shares. So, the $64 million question (or $5.5 billion question in this case) is what kind of company is Pershing Square looking for and when is it likely to happen.\n\nFinding the right match\n\nPershing Square is looking for a minority position and we are assuming they will have $5.5 billion of capital. We also believe it will be just one large company they will be spending the money on. By prospectus, they have to spend at least 80% of their capital. If you assume they would want at least 10% of the company, that makes the target worth between $8.8 and $55 billion. Pershing Square will look for a company with similar characteristics as its activist investments: a simple, high-quality, high return on capital business that generates predictable growing cash flows that can be estimated within a reasonable range over the long term. The types of companies it will be looking at will be: (i) a high-quality, well-managed, large capitalization company that is looking for a better alternative to an IPO, such as Rocket Mortgage, which just recently filed for an IPO; (ii) a \"mature unicorn\" \u2014 a high-quality, venture-backed business that has achieved significant scale, market share, competitive dominance and cash flow that does not have as much private funding options as it used to due to the problems at Softbank and the ramifications to the venture market from companies like WeWork; (iii) large private equity portfolio companies that have become distressed due to their typically highly leveraged balance sheets and will require substantial equity infusions to withstand the impact of the current crisis; and (iv) large, high-quality, private family-owned companies that now are required to raise capital due to the economic downturn caused by the COVID\u201319 pandemic. How long will this take? Well, by prospectus, they have 2 years to sign a deal and then six months to close thereafter. But it will not take nearly that long. The crisis that has made this the perfect environment for this strategy will last for about another nine months. We expect Pershing Square to find the company by then. There are only approximately 150 companies that fit their parameters, so they likely already have their top ten wish list, including obvious companies that pop out such as Airbnb and Bloomberg.\n\nThe perfect opportunity", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/bill-ackman-and-tontine-holdings-rewrite-the-terms-for-spacs.html", "author": ["Kenneth Squire"]}, {"title": "CEOs reflect on tough quarter, but also offer some good news on earnings calls", "text": "Coca-Cola President and CEO James Quincey attends a press conference with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president and China Mengniu Dairy CEO and Executive Director, as part of the 134th Session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at the SwissTech Convention Centre in Lausanne, on June 24, 2019.\n\nWith so few companies providing numerical guidance, investors are listening carefully to earnings conference calls for some hint \u2014 any hint \u2014 on what is going on.\n\nHere are some comments from CEOs in the last day or so, on tobacco, gasoline, RV, truck and can sales.\n\nThe main thing that stands out from earnings conference calls so far: It's really tough figuring out what is going on.

In Norway, which is often cited as a model for low emission cars, the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association says that electric vehicles do not have to pay annual road tax, have \"access to bus lanes\" and are exempt from 25% value added tax on purchases, among other things. According to the association, these incentives are in place \"until the end of 2021\", when the government will make revisions to them.\n\n\n\nGovernments are also making efforts to improve charging infrastructure. In January, the U.K. government said it would \"double the funding\" for \"the installation of chargepoints on residential streets\" to \u00a310 million ($12.72 million).

Mladen Antonov | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThailand has over the past week lost several government ministers \u2014 including those holding crucial economic portfolios \u2014 as the coronavirus pandemic slams the tourism-dependent Southeast Asian economy. The country has a history of political instability and has also experienced one of the highest numbers of military coups in modern history. The latest upheaval has come at a time when the government faces pressure to improve the country's economy while large-scale pro-democracy demonstrations have called for the resignation of the government. So far, six ministers have resigned from their position, reported Reuters. That include Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana and Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak, whom the Reuters report referred to as an \"economic policy czar.\"\n\nThe resignation of Somkid, who was the architect of Prayut's economic policies, causes some policy uncertainty at a critical time when the economy is going through a deep recession. Nomura analysts\n\nIt's not yet clear who will take over those positions, but Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said he will announce a cabinet reshuffle by next month. Some analysts said delays in replacing the country's crucial economic architects could hurt investor confidence at a time when the Thai economy is expected to register the worst contraction in Asia this year. The Thai currency and stock market have also been among the worst performing in the region despite the country's relative success in containing its virus outbreak. As of Tuesday, the Thai baht had lost around 6% against the U.S. dollar while the benchmark stock index, SET Index, has fallen close to 13% so far this year.\n\n'Intense jockeying for cabinet seats'\n\nThe ministers' resignations followed earlier reports of a power struggle within the ruling coalition's largest party, Palang Pracharath. The party and its political partners control a slim majority in Thailand's 500-member House of Representatives. Before their resignation from the government, four of the ministers \u2014 including former Finance Minister Uttama \u2014 quit Palang Pracharath as party members, reported the Associated Press. Uttama was leader of the pro-military party.\n\nHarrison Cheng, associate director and lead analyst for Thailand at consultancy Control Risks, said the cabinet reshuffle has triggered an \"intense jockeying\" for government positions among members of the ruling coalition. That could also worsen infighting among members, he added. He explained in a note last week that the prime minister's plan to recruit \"reputable individuals\" from the public and private sectors to lead several economic ministries will \"trigger deep resentment\" among the different political factions.\n\nDisagreements are likely to flare up both within the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) and among coalition members, and could delay the finalisation of the reshuffle by up to two months. Harrison Cheng Control Risks\n\nStill, the Prayuth government is likely to stay intact as parties within the ruling coalition have little to gain from withdrawing, said Cheng. The opposition also doesn't have the numbers to challenge the ruling coalition, he added. \"Disagreements are likely to flare up both within the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) and among coalition members, and could delay the finalisation of the reshuffle by up to two months, which is likely to hurt investor confidence,\" wrote Cheng. Prayuth has reportedly invited a top Thai banker to join his new cabinet lineup. Some local media reports also named the country's outgoing central bank governor Veerathai Santiprabhob as a possible candidate \u2014 but Reuters reported that Veerathai has ruled out joining the new cabinet.\n\nPolitical uncertainty 'not new'\n\nThe Thai economy, which is heavily dependent on tourism, is expected to register the worst economic contraction in Asia this year, according to forecasts by Capital Economics.

In the first week of July, the margin balance outstanding in China accelerated 9% to 1.3 trillion yuan, according to a South China Morning Post report.\n\nSome platforms illegally financing margin trading were allowing investors to borrow over 1,000 yuan ($143) to buy stocks for a deposit of as little as 100 yuan, a leverage of 10 times, according to Chinese media Caixin Global.\n\nIn 2015, there was a similar boom and bust in China fueled by illegal margin lending that saw the Shanghai composite fall more than 40% from its peak in just a few weeks, according to Reuters.

That was despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advice in early April that people wear face coverings in public settings where social distancing is a challenge.\n\nFast forward to Monday, the president posted a black-and-white photo of himself wearing a mask calling it \"Patriotic\" to do so and saying that no one is \"more Patriotic than me, your favorite President!\"\n\nThe mask promotion, in addition to another potential round of stimulus spending to prop up the economy, sparked a rally in the recovery plays, including the lagging retail stocks, banking sector and even Disney and Starbucks, as masks can help contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, Cramer noted.

If we can do that, then we'll be able to have the tests that we need,\" Schechter said on \"Closing Bell.\"\n\nLabCorp is currently processing about 165,000 tests for Covid-19 per day, translating to more than 1 million per week, he said. In late March during the early stages of the pandemic, LabCorp was running about 20,000 tests per day.\n\n\"We're continuing to increase capacity every single week over week,\" he said. \"The problem is that the number of tests being asked to be performed each week is growing faster than the capacity that we can build.\"\n\nFor someone in the hospital, LabCorp is able to return Covid-19 tests results within 1.5 days on average, Schechter said. Average turnaround time is about three to five days for someone who isn't in the hospital, he said, while a range of about two to three days is needed to have an \"effective ability to track and trace people that are sick or have been exposed to people.\"\n\nLike LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics also has warned that its turnaround time for testing results has slowed as transmission of the virus spreads in certain parts of the U.S., especially across the American South, Southwest and West.\n\nTesting for Covid-19 in the U.S. has been beset by challenges since the early days of the pandemic, including strains on the supply chain. But daily testing capacity has continued to scale up.\n\nIn the last 7 days, the U.S. has averaged nearly 763,000 diagnostic tests per day, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Covid Tracking Project. The national average in April was about 174,000 diagnostic tests per day, per a CNBC analysis.\n\nThe overall rise in new Covid-19 cases in the U.S. can only be partly attributed to added testing capacity. That's because the test positivity rate also has increased, an indication of how broadly the virus is spreading throughout a community.\n\nThe U.S. has an 8.5% positivity rate, based on a seven-day moving average, according to Johns Hopkins University. In early June, the seven-day moving average had dropped below 5% nationally. At times in April, the U.S. positivity rate was around 20%.\n\nSchechter said he believes the U.S. needs to be \"really thoughtful\" about demand for Covid-19 testing as it approaches the fall \u2014 a time when students may be heading back to school and more people potentially ease out of working from home.\n\n\"I am concerned about it, but we have to look at it holistically,\" he said, stressing the need for American residents to wear face masks and continue practicing social distancing. He added that quicker turnaround time for tests is a part of the solution, along with further progress on research for vaccines and therapeutics.\n\n\"If we pull those things together, I believe we can believe this virus and get the country up and running again in a very significant way,\" he said.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/labcorp-ceo-coronavirus-is-spreading-faster-than-testing-expansion.html", "author": ["Kevin Stankiewicz"]}, {"title": "How Taiwan beat the coronavirus, plus everything else you missed in business news: CNBC After Hours", "text": "\n\nCNBC.com's MacKenzie Sigalos brings you the day's top business news headlines.

By talking to a wide range of experts, as well as everyday citizens, we're taking stock of what's gone well \u2014 and what hasn't. Germany has confirmed more than 200,000 cases of Covid-19 and more than 9,000 deaths in a population of more than 83 million. Germany's mortality rate per 100,000 is among the lowest in Europe. By way of comparison, the U.S., with about four times the population, has had more than 3.8 million cases and 140,000 deaths.\n\nWhat went really well\n\nScience communication\n\nA women walks past street art painted by artist Kai 'Uzey' Wohlgemuth featuring a nurse as Superwoman on April 14, 2020 in Hamm, Germany. Lars Baron | Getty Images\n\nGermany, like many other countries, had a contingent of people who fought lockdowns and argued that Covid-19 was a hoax. But it also had a handful of prominent scientists communicating regularly and openly with the public. That played a huge role in drowning out rumors and misinformation, locals tell CNBC. \"We have a great educational system and everyone has access to it,\" said Dennis Traub, a tech worker in Hamburg, Germany. \"So I believe that many people and the majority listened to both sides and one of those sides sounded much more reasonable.\"\n\nChristian Drosten, Director of the Institute of Virology, speaks about the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, February 13, 2020. Britta Pedersen | picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nOn the side of science, virologist Christian Drosten grew his podcast, \"Das Coronavirus-Update\" to millions of followers in the early days of the pandemic. Drosten is now a cult icon in Germany akin to Dr. Tony Fauci in the United States. He doesn't dumb down the science. Instead, he shares complex ideas in an accessible way and gets real with the public about aspects of the virus that are not well understood. In addition to that, the public regularly hears from the (now very well-known) Minister of Health Jens Spahn, as well as Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel.\n\nIn April, Merkel drew from her own science background by walking Germans through the basic reproductive number (the \"R0\") -- a mathematical term that indicates how contagious a virus is -- as a way to instill confidence in lockdowns. Moreover, Germans say their children got educated on the coronavirus via popular television shows like \"Die Sendung mit der Maus\" (Germany's equivalent to \"Sesame Street\"). Germans say the guidelines now are clear. \"If you have a set of rules that are communicated well, people don't feel like they're on their own,\" said Florian Otto, a German health tech entrepreneur who co-founded the payments start-up Cedar. \"And when people know what to do, they encourage each other.\" Hospitals weren't overwhelmed Hospitals in Germany were not overwhelmed by Covid-19. That meant doctors could even treat patients from neighboring countries, including Italy and Spain, where critically ill people were airlifted in. How did that happen? Well, in March, Germany's hospital system started freeing up intensive care beds and pushing back elective surgeries to make space for a potential flood of Covid-19 patients. Many hospitals also shared data with a federal website to map out their supply chain needs relative to other facilities. \"The website is (now) a live-dashboard of all available ICU beds in participating hospitals Germany wide,\" said Niklas Rindtorff, a medical student in his final year of studies in Heidelberg, Germany, who also has a background in medical informatics.\n\nHospital doctors are instructed how to operate a ventilator at the Universitaetsklinikum Eppendorf in Hamburg, on March 25, 2020. Axel Heimken | POOL | AFP | Getty Images\n\nGermany also built out extra intensive care facilities just in case. \"After the collapse of the hospitals in northern Italy, the German government built up additional capacities in the intensive care units,\" said Uwe Frers, an entrepreneur based in Berlin. \"This was the right step, even if the capacities were ultimately not needed.\" Some experts believe that Germany's high-quality intensive care -- as well as its focus on testing -- helped reduce the mortality of the disease in the country. Germany has one of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases, but relatively few citizens died compared with other European nations. Some experts are even referring to the phenomenon as the \"German anomaly.\" Mental health support After sheltering in place, many Germans were encouraged to exercise outdoors as long as they were able to keep their distance from others. There was also a concerted effort to encourage Germans to stay in contact via Skype or Zoom, so people wouldn't feel lonely or isolated. \"There was a big campaign around mental health,\" said Dr. Sandra Kamping, a psychologist based in Hamburg. \"Here people could go outside even during lockdown for a walk or a bike ride,\" added Carlos Barragan, an IT worker based in Germany.\n\nNurse Sylke Pflugmacher takes a sample at a testing point for medical staff members at the community hospital in Magdeburg, eastern Germany, on April 16, 2020 during the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Ronny Hartmann | AFP | Getty Images\n\nAccess to doctors Germany is known for its strong network of family practitioners, who are typically the first point of contact for accessing health care. \"There is very low barrier to entry to see a high-quality doctor,\" said Christian Dierks, a lawyer focused on medicine who runs an innovation consultancy firm in Berlin. \"Sick leave is also very easy, and you can take time off from work to see your doctor.\" Because of that, some locals say, citizens were able to access some routine care and get advice if they were experiencing symptoms of Covid-19. In some cases, they were told to stay home while others with more serious symptoms were referred to the hospital. That might have helped Germans navigate to the right place. The Merkel effect\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel adjusts her protective mask on her way to a Bavarian state cabinet meeting at Herrenchiemsee Island, Germany. Peter Kneffel | Pool via Reuters\n\nWhat went OK\n\nStates making their own decisions In Germany, the federal government and the states haven't always agreed about the right next steps during the pandemic. In some ways, that lack of consistency isn't helpful. But others point out that it's also an opportunity to share lessons learned: \"Germany's federal system gives the individual states a very high degree of freedom in choosing the means of overcoming the crisis,\" said Frers. \"On the one hand good for learning from each other, on the other hand critical when quick decisions have to be made on a large scale.\"\n\nCitizens walk at the pedestrian zone in Guetersloh, western Germany. Ina Fassbender | AFP | Getty Images\n\nRamping up testing Germany is considered ahead of most other European countries when it comes to testing. It very quickly ramped up drive-through testing via nasal swabs and, according to the BBC, carried out more diagnostic swab tests than any other major European country. It may still not be enough as the country reopens -- a point that the local press have emphasized -- but it's better than most. \"We are very good in testing because we have a centralized but still coordinated testing system,\" said Christian Angermayer, an entrepreneur and investor from Germany. \"Almost from the beginning, we had widespread testing.\" Contact tracing apps When Germany released an app for contact tracing, called the Corona-Warn-App, more than 15 million people signed up. \"Many people downloaded it, representing a huge chunk of the population in Germany,\" said Otto. Germany's Health Ministry has reported some success: More than 500 people who tested positive used the app to notify others who might have been exposed. Health officials noted that the apps were designed with privacy in mind, but reports indicate that no system is perfect. One recent issue that's emerged is that Google Android users must first turn on their device location, which could allow Google to follow their movements. Still, Germany embraced tracking (both the tech and more traditional, analog version) and testing early on, which may have contributed to its success.\n\nGermany's coronavirus contact-tracing app, Corona-Warn, is displayed on an iPhone in Berlin on Tuesday, June 16, 2020. Krisztian Bocsi | Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nFinancial support According to Kamping, the mental health expert, it also helped alleviate stress and anxiety that many Germans did not fear losing their livelihoods. If companies were struggling, there's a program in place for employees to receive a high percentage of their usual pay rather than being laid off. The idea is that instead of having employers cut staff, workers can apply for unemployment benefits and the government will subsidize those employers directly. Some 10 million Germans are benefiting from the program, called \"Kurzabeit,\" according to Propublica. But some say that corporations might have fared better than small businesses. \"In my view, however, the small and medium-sized enterprises, which are so important in Germany, have been left behind due to a lack of lobbying power, unlike the large corporations,\" said Frers. And the programs didn't cover everyone: There has still been a bump in unemployment in Germany, which could rise further still with additional Covid-19 outbreaks.\n\nWhat could have been better\n\nMask shortages and policies In the early days of the pandemic, some Germans say it was a challenge to access masks. The problem was so stark that a group of doctors in late April even posed nude to raise awareness of the problem of personal protective equipment shortages. The idea was to show the public how vulnerable they were without protection. In response, many Germans banded together to start making their own masks, including to sew them. \"I received at least five offers (of masks) from family and friends,\" said junior doctor Pascal Nohl-Deryk, who noted that his hospital also started sharing masks for his own personal use. Now, he says, masks are available across Germany at low prices. One other issue that's come up recently is whether to mandate the use of masks in supermarkets. There's some debate about it, but some doctors say that politicians should support the measure. \"There's enough scientific evidence about transmission in indoor spaces,\" said Dr. Harald Schneider, an endocrinologist based in Germany. \"I'm convinced we need strong measures.\" Rumors and conspiracy theories Germany may have had an enviable Covid-19 response, but it still had its fair share of conspiracy theories. As local reporters have shared, groups of protesters have mobilized to share unfounded rumors and misinformation. Some accused Bill Gates of forcing vaccinations on the population, while others targeted Merkel. Drosten, the popular virologist, received death threats and was accused of spreading fear about the coronavirus. \"For many Germans, I'm the evil guy who is crippling the economy,\" Drosten told the Guardian. Problems with easing lockdowns Going into lockdown may have been easier for Germany than getting out. After watching Italy and China, Germany began to get prepared and was relatively early in imposing restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19. But as one local outlet points out, it could have even come sooner. Still, Germany used its time well and the lockdown, by all accounts, was fairly effective in combating the spread of the virus. However, some have noted that Germany may have been a victim of its own success. Because some citizens didn't have much exposure to the virus, they questioned whether the measures were too draconian. And once the country decided to reopen, some states rushed to open faster than others -- (critics felt there could have been a more cohesive national strategy). Meanwhile, as recent outbreaks have struck a few regions, Germany has started to impose restrictions once again.\n\nHow Germany scores overall: 8.25/10", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/germanys-coronavirus-response-masterful-science-communication.html", "author": ["Christina Farr"]}, {"title": "Stock futures under pressure from U.S.-China tensions, earnings onslaught", "text": "U.S. stock futures fell in early trading Wednesday amid renewed U.S.-China tensions and ahead of major technology earnings from Microsoft and Tesla after the closing bell.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 58 points, or 0.2%.

The race is on to combat the coronavirus. Since the outbreak was first identified at the start of this year, pharmaceutical giants and institutions have been grabbing headlines as they roll out trials at breakneck speed. But behind the scenes, many more businesses have been playing their part to keep the virus under control and identify symptoms at source. That has sparked major innovations in the field of medical technology, with repercussions likely to be felt long into the future. CNBC Make It spoke to three start-up entrepreneurs to get the pulse on how they're changing the face of healthcare under the pandemic.\n\nHow the doctor will see you now\n\nThe World Health Organization describes medical technology, or medtech, as the use of knowledge and technology in devices, medicines, and procedures to advance human health. One aspect of that which has been vital lately is telemedicine \u2014 or remote health-care services \u2014 as more people seek medical advice from the safety of their homes.\n\nJohannes Schildt, co-founder and CEO of Swedish telemedicine start-up Kry. Kry\n\nThat's a function 32-year-old Swedish entrepreneur, Johannes Schildt, and his co-founders have been providing for the past five years with their medical video consultation service, Kry. Also known as Livi in English-speaking markets, the platform connects users in Europe with qualified doctors as an alternative to in-person care. But since the outbreak, that offering has taken on new significance, said Schildt. \"(Now) with the rather sad backdrop of a pandemic, it's starting to be painfully obvious for a lot of people that this is a crucial part of their health-care infrastructure.\" Between February and April, as more and more countries entered lockdown, demand on the app surged 160%, both for Covid-19 queries and general care. Meanwhile, more health-care professionals joined the platform to supplement their incomes.\n\nIt has really opened the eyes of a lot of people ... what we have been doing for five years is really a good thing. Johannes Schildt co-founder and CEO, Kry\n\nThe growing need for remote health-care services has also led to an easing of regulations, which traditionally prevented the adoption of telemedicine in some markets. Schildt said he hopes the move could help make digital health care more accessible. In April, the company rolled out Livi Connect, a free basic service, to users in the U.S. \"You've had nations that were not allowed to do telemedicine, and it was not reimbursed. But this is now rapidly changing across the globe,\" said Schildt. \"It has really opened the eyes of a lot of people and entities that what we have been doing for five years is really a good thing.\"\n\nPredicting Covid-19 symptoms\n\nThe recent evolution of medtech has also led to a wave of wearable devices designed to put individuals' health data in their own hands. Ranging from watches to rings, the devices collect physiological data \u2014 such as changes in heart rate, body temperature and sleep patterns \u2014 to provide a picture of a user's overall health. But during the pandemic, some have also helped identify early symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nHarpreet Singh Rai, CEO of Finnish healthtech start-up Oura. Oura\n\nThat was the case for Finnish smart health tracker Oura. Indeed, while the titanium Oura ring had been successful in predicting previous flu seasons, CEO Harpreet Singh Rai said the company was first alerted to the device's coronavirus capabilities by a user. The man had returned from a skiing trip in early March when a drop in his Oura \"readiness\" score prompted him to go for a coronavirus test. \"He described himself as asymptomatic, which he thought made this virus so dangerous,\" said Singh Rai. \"(He) told people about his experience with Oura and seeing such meaningful changes in data that allowed him to understand that he may be sick.\"\n\nIf someone is really elevated on the risk score ... they suggest that a second test be done. Harpreet Singh Rai CEO, Oura\n\nIn light of the discovery, the company is now finding ways to use that data to help detect cases among frontline workers and general users. That also includes partnering with athletes to get the sports calendar back on track. According to Singh Rai, the NBA bought more than 1,000 rings in June, which cost upwards of $300 each, as their season resumes at the end of the month. \"We work really, really hard with both the NBA and the NBPA, which is essentially their union, to make sure that players felt secure about their data,\" said Singh Rai. \"(So) our team came up with this idea of a risk score,\" he continued. \"If someone is really elevated on the risk score, they ... call the team medical doctor and they suggest that a second test be done for Covid.\"\n\nMaking research representative\n\nAs medtech devices become more widely used, they also present opportunities to improve medical research. In the face of new and unpredictable diseases like the coronavirus, that research is vital to help stop the spread. That's something 30-year-old Lea von Bidder, co-founder and CEO of Swiss women's health company, Ava, aims to help with \u2014 by offering insights on how Covid-19 affects different groups of society. Specifically, that includes the impact on women.\n\nLea von Bidder, co-founder and CEO of Swiss healthcare start-up Ava.

Bahamas welcomed, then shut out U.S. travelers", "text": "Less than three weeks after reopening to international travelers, the Bahamas is closing its borders to U.S. residents after a rise of coronavirus infections on the island nation. In a national address on July 19, Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis announced that airports and seaports would close to all travelers except those coming from Canada, the U.K. and EU starting July 22 at midnight. While he did not specifically single out American tourists, that country has accounted for most of the Bahamas' stopover visitors \u2014 more than 78% as of 2016. \"I understand the frustration and disappointment of many Bahamians and residents that may ensue as we reimplement certain restrictions,\" Minnis said. \"But as a country ... we have to do what is right and we have to do what is necessary.\" He said Bahamasair, the Bahamas national airline, will immediately cease all flights to the U.S. too.\n\n(The situation) deteriorated at an exponential rate since we reopened our international borders. Hubert Minnis prime minister of the Bahamas\n\nA record-breaking 7.2 million tourists visited the Bahamas in 2019, despite the devastation inflicted by Hurricane Dorian last year. Most of those visitors were from the United States. The Bahamas is the closest Caribbean island to U.S. shores. One of its islands, Bimini, lies about 50 miles east of Miami and is reachable via charter boat or a two-hour fast ferry departing from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The travel reversal is a new blow to American travelers, who after being locked out of the EU, were welcomed by many Caribbean islands earlier this summer.\n\nWhat happened in the Bahamas\n\nAs of July 19, the Bahamas' Ministry of Health confirmed 49 new cases of Covid-19 since the country reopened its borders to international travelers on July 1. Of these, 31 were on the popular island of Grand Bahama, which had gone more than two months without any cases before the borders reopened.\n\nThree islands \u2014 New Providence (shown here), Grand Bahama and Bimini \u2014 account nearly all coronavirus infections in the Bahamas. Justin Crowder / EyeEm | EyeEm | Getty Images\n\nIn total, the Bahamas, which has nearly 400,000 people, has confirmed 153 cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. \"Regrettably, the situation here at home has already deteriorated since we began the reopening of our domestic economy,\" said Minnis, adding that it \"deteriorated at an exponential rate since we reopened our international borders.\"\n\nHow the Bahamas responded\n\nMinnis announced additional measures to help curb the spread of Covid-19: \u00b7 Beaches and parks on New Providence, Paradise Island, Grand Bahama and other locations have been closed. \u00b7 Restaurants at Arawak Cay and Potter's Cay will also be closed until better social distancing can be practiced and enforced.\n\nGrenada stands apart for its cautious reopening approach. Buena Vista Images\n\n\u00b7 Grand Bahama only: A daily curfew from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. is in effect, and international and domestic borders will be closed effective July 22. Indoor dining is not allowed and bars are closed. Church services, weddings, funerals and sports activities are no longer permitted, and fines will be issued for flouting social distancing and mask rules. Minnis warned that if cases continue to rise, the Bahamas could go on lockdown as early as July 24.\n\nHow others are approaching U.S. travelers\n\nMany Caribbean nations \u2014 such as Antigua, Aruba, Bermuda, Jamaica and St. Lucia \u2014 had either already reopened, or were on the precipice of reopening, when U.S. coronavirus cases started to surge in mid-to-late June. Caribbean countries quickly began adding stricter measures, such as negative Covid-19 tests, to enter. Grenada, however, took a different approach. Citing an increase in infection rates, especially in the U.S., it delayed reopening. On July 10, Grenada announced a three-tiered approach to begin on August 1: \u00b7 Low-risk countries, such as other Caribbean nations, can take a rapid test upon arrival. Those testing positive must take a Covid-19 PCR test, which if positive would require a 14-day quarantine or two negative test results.\n\nThese Caribbean nations will not be the last to react in this manner. Mark Cameron epidemiologist, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine\n\n\u00b7 Medium-risk countries where \"there is active, but manageable transmission,\" such as Canada, the U.K. and EU nations, must present a negative Covid-19 PCR test upon arrival and undergo a rapid test upon entry, which if negative would allow \"limited movement\" thereafter. \u00b7 High-risk countries where \"there is active and widespread transmission\" (arriving mainly via charter flights and yachts) must arrive with negative PCR tests in hand, undergo rapid tests and, even if negative, must quarantine for 14 days in accommodations approved by the Ministry of Health. To date, Grenada has only had 23 confirmed Covid-19 cases, all of whom have recovered.\n\nA sign of things to come?", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/bahamas-shuts-out-americans-after-coronavirus-cases-rise-on-islands.html", "author": ["Monica Buchanan Pitrelli"]}, {"title": "Uber kicks off final appeal against major UK ruling on drivers' employment rights", "text": "In this photo illustration the Uber logo is displayed on a phone in front of Tower Bridge on November 25, 2019 in London, England.\n\nUber is taking its fight against a U.K. ruling that its drivers should be classified as workers to the country's highest court.\n\nThe ride-sharing giant will kick off a last-ditch attempt to appeal the landmark employment rights case in a two-day hearing at the Supreme Court on Tuesday.\n\nThe legal battle began back in 2016 when an employment tribunal ruled in favor of a group of Uber drivers led by Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar.

The Memorial is open from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. and has one way in (Greenwich Street) and one way out (Liberty Street).\n\nThe 9/11 Memorial has a canopy of nearly 400 oak trees and twin reflecting pools outlined with victims' names inscribed in bronze.

Visitors can also buy masks through a \"buy one, give one\" initiative that provides a mask to an essential worker for every one purchased at the Memorial or through the online Museum store. Tours are not currently permitted, as all visitors must stay six feet apart. Social distancing hasn't been difficult, said Michael Frazier, the site's executive vice president, owing in part to the fact that the Memorial is now drawing hundreds of visitors each day, compared with thousands before the health crisis. Frazier said there is a queue to enter \"but visitors shouldn't expect long wait times.\"\n\nVisitors must use hand sanitizer before and after touching the names inscribed on the bronze walls at the 9/11 Memorial. tzahiV\n\nVisiting the 9/11 Memorial is still free, and tickets aren't required, though to offset \"staggering financial challenges,\" a fundraising campaign was started to help keep the Memorial open.

Visitors are asked to distance from one another while moving inside the London Eye \"pods.\" They're asked to wear masks at all times. \"Although the experience has evolved \u2026 seeing the iconic views of London that we're known for remains the same,\" said Dolan.\n\nBurj Khalifa\n\nClosed: March 15\n\nReopened: May 28 Since Dubai reopened its borders on July 7, international tourists can once again visit the \"At the Top\" observation deck located on the 124th floor of the world's tallest building.\n\nAll 160 stories of the Burj Khalifa were used to send safety messages to the residents of Dubai.

Though most of the nearly 3,700 centrally-protected monuments and archaeological sites maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India have now been reopened, the Taj Mahal is not one of them.\n\nWhen it reopens, visitors can tour the Taj Mahal with hundreds, rather than thousands, of others. smerindo_schultzpax\n\nLocal authorities decided against opening it in part because the 17th-century mausoleum is located in a containment zone, an area within a town or village that has been sealed off to prevent the spread of new infections. There were 85 containment zones in Agra as of July 18. When it does reopen, visitors to the Taj Mahal will be capped at 5,000 a day (in two segments) and be subject to time limits, reported The Indian Express. Before the pandemic, the site was known to draw 70,000 daily visitors on busy days.\n\nMilan Cathedral\n\nClosed to tourists: March 9\n\nReopened: May 29 Travelers can tour the Milan Cathedral, provided they wear masks, sanitize their hands, submit to a temperature check, and stay more than six feet away from others.\n\nOpenly wandering around the Duomo di Milano (Milan Cathedral) is no longer possible; visitors must now follow a specific route.

The Maldives reopened to international visitors this week, after being closed to visitors since March 27. While much of the world has shut its borders or enacted strict measures on incoming travelers, the Maldives will not require new arrivals to quarantine or undergo testing, other than a simple temperature check at the airport. There is one other rule: Visitors must book their entire stay at the same resort whilst visiting the South Asian country. Minister for Tourism Ali Waheed has described the impact of the pandemic as, \"more devastating than the 2004 tsunami and the 2008 global financial crisis.\" With a population of half a million, the Maldives has recorded more than 2,700 cases of Covid-19. Its government originally announced it would require visitors to pay a new $100 visa fee and $100 for a Covid-19 test at the airport, plus stay a minimum of 14 nights. It has since dropped those requirements. Airlines, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, are resuming services to the island nation. Despite the nation being open for business, hotels are only gradually reopening, with Conrad Maldives Rangali Island planning to reopen at the end of September, and St. Regis and all other Marriott International hotels in the Maldives not planning to reopen until October.\n\nOn-site hotel testing eases anxieties \u2014 for some\n\nOne resort, however, reopened immediately with new measures designed to stay clear of the virus. Guests of Soneva Fushi will be given a mask upon arrival and be tested for Covid-19. Guests are then required to stay in their room or villa until their test results come back, which could take between six and 24 hours. If they receive negative test results, guests can roam freely, but must still conduct daily temperature checks. On the fourth day of their trip, an additional test will be carried out. \"You might consider that this is excessive and that we're being overcautious,\" said Sonu Shivdasani, CEO of Soneva, in a corporate video explaining the process. Yet his aim is \"to make all our private islands Covid-free environments so the guests can truly relax and engage with our hosts (and) fellow guests.\" A socially-distanced guest experience simply didn't appeal to Shivdasani. \"Life is about relationships, you know, the secret of life is about the friendships you make,\" Shivdasani told CNBC. \"This idea of our guests distancing from each other, we felt would be a real challenge and we didn't want them to feel uncomfortable engaging with others.\"\n\n\"For the urban rich, luxury is about sitting outside in the open air.\" Sonu Shivdasani Soneva CEO\n\nIn fact, 55% of its revenue is generated by repeat guests, whom he said often mingle with one another. One factor that could lure tourists to the Maldives is its desolate nature, especially compared to say, a beach club in Mykonos. Also, many health experts have said being outdoors poses a lower risk for contracting Covid-19 than being indoors. \"The urban rich have all the famous designer restaurants in their cities, the famous branded chefs in air-conditioned environments,\" Shivdasani said. \"For the urban rich, luxury is about sitting outside in the open air.\" Soneva thinks its tight health measures could pay off. The hotel said reservations for August are higher than last year. Yet, not everyone was willing to undergo its new policies. \"We've had one or two who feel it's unnecessary and didn't want to put their children through this difficulty,\" he said, \"but most have said that's actually reassured them, and I've received lots of emails say, 'Fantastic, bravo. I was thinking about where to go, but I'm now coming to stay with you.'\"\n\nHotels are ramping up cleaning services\n\nHilton, meanwhile, which has three resorts operating under its brands in the Maldives, will be gradually opening with new measures in place, including staff temperature checks and increased cleaning procedures. Nils-Arne Schroeder, vice president of luxury and lifestyle for Hilton's Asia Pacific hotels, outlined the company's new measures to CNBC: \"You didn't want to see the people cleaning your public areas in the lobby; it was always cleaned in the night. Nowadays, you want to see them actually during the day so you know the hotel is looking after the cleaning.\" Last month, Hilton rolled out new guidelines for its properties worldwide. Called Hilton CleanStay, one measure includes putting a seal on the doors after cleaning a room to visibly show customers that nobody has since entered.\n\nA socially-distanced sand bank dinner at Soneva Fushi. Courtesy of Soneva Fushi\n\nGuests staying at Hilton properties will have their temperatures checked, but will not be required to take Covid-19 tests. \"You can make decisions if you want to be distanced from everyone else because you can be in your villa, you can have in-villa dining all day, you can jump into your ocean ... but if you want to be part of the island community, of course, we are ready for you, to make sure that the self-distancing is available,\" Schroeder said.\n\nWill tourists be willing to travel if they must quarantine after?\n\nMarriott International plans to reopen its Maldives resorts in October and is implementing new policies, such as requiring guests to sit at the same table each day for breakfast. But, whether travelers feel safe enough to travel or leave their hometown and be subjected to restrictions, is yet to be determined. For instance, Hong Kong residents who leave the city must take a Covid-19 test upon their return and they are required to quarantine for 14-days while wearing a location-tracking wristband.\n\nSome resorts in the Maldives are requiring guests undergo Covid-19 tests, while others are not.

However, based on Pershing Square's current assets under management, we do not expect their contribution to exceed $1.5 billion, for a total capitalization of $5.5 billion. This is the second time in its history that Pershing Square has sponsored a SPAC. Ackman will be on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Wednesday at 8:15 am to discuss the investment Pershing Square also served as co-sponsor of Justice Holdings, with Nicolas Berggruen and Martin Franklin. Justice Holdings raised approximately $1.5 billion in its initial public offering in February of 2011 (including a $458 million investment by Pershing Square). In April of 2012, Justice Holdings purchased from 3G Capital a 29% stake in Burger King Worldwide Holdings Inc. for $1.4 billion in cash, and subsequently merged with Tim Hortons, to form Restaurant Brands International. Pershing Square still remains the second-largest investor in Restaurant Brands International. As of June 30, 2020 the stock of Restaurant Brands International has generated a compound annual total return of 19% since its merger with Justice Holdings, even after losing 30% of its value during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe basic structure of a SPAC is that investors buy common stock in the IPO of a blank check company, in this case, for $20 per share. In addition to the common stock, they receive warrants as an incentive for them to invest. These warrants are generally detachable, allowing the investor to trade them as separate securities and inviting the short-term investing arbitrage world into SPACs, which often make up a significant part of the shareholder base. The SPAC sponsor will then find a company to acquire and investors will essentially have the choice of staying invested in the SPAC through the acquisition or redeeming their shares for the full amount they acquired them for. The structure of Tontine Holdings is unique on many different levels. First, each unit consists of: (i) one share of common stock, (ii) one-ninth of a redeemable warrant, exercisable at $23; and (iii) two-ninths of a warrant, exercisable at $23 provided that they are not redeemed in connection with a proposed business combination. It is this last element that is significant. The one-ninth of a warrant is detachable on day 52 and this is a normal incentive for SPAC investors. However, unlike virtually all other SPACs where all warrants are detachable, two-thirds of the warrants issued to shareholders are not detachable, discouraging the arb community and encouraging long term investors. Moreover, the investors do not even receive these two-thirds of warrants if they choose to redeem their stock prior to the closing of the acquisition, giving a significant amount of more certainty that the acquisition will close. And finally, as additional incentive to hold the securities through the closing, if a shareholder does redeem, their warrants are distributed pro rata to the shareholders who remain in the SPAC, hence the name \"Tontine\" holdings. A tontine is an investment plan devised in the 17th century whereby each investor pays an agreed sum into the fund and thereafter receives a periodic payout with that payment devolving to the other participants upon the death of an investor. But the most unique feature of this SPAC and the greatest departure from historical SPACs is the compensation terms for the SPAC sponsor, in this case Pershing Square Holdings. The normal historical SPAC sponsor will partly capitalize the operations of the SPAC by acquiring sponsor warrants giving them a participation in the upside of the company. But that is far from their main compensation. Typically, SPAC sponsors receive 20% of the shares in the SPAC for extremely nominal consideration. These founders shares compensate the sponsor regardless of whether the shares in the company appreciate or decline. For example, in a recent SPAC sponsored by Goldman Sachs, they raised $700 million at $10 per share. They paid $16 million for warrants to acquire 8 million shares at $11.50 per share and received Founders shares for 20% of the company for $5,000. On the day of the closing that $5,000 payment yielded them $140 million of stock assuming a deal closes. Another example a little older but involving a peer of Pershing Square is Third Point's 2018 sponsoring of Far Point Acquisition Corp. where it raised $500 million at $10 per share. In that situation, Third Point paid $12 million for warrants to buy 8 million shares at $11.50 per share and received its 20% of Founder shares for a nominal payment of only $25,000. So, assuming a deal closes, Third Point receives $100 million of its shareholders' investment regardless of whether the investment is successful or not. Moreover, under the Founders' shares compensation structure, Third Point and Goldman Sachs still receive tens of millions of dollars of compensation even in a failed investment that loses half of its value. In contrast, in Tontine Holdings, Pershing Square and its affiliates (including Tontine board members) are paying $67.8 million for warrants to acquire 6.21% of the company. This is much more consideration than the $16 million and $12 million that Goldman and Third Point paid and much less than the 9.1% and 12.8% of shares that Goldman and Third Point received. Moreover, Goldman and Third Point's warrants were exercisable at a 15% premium to the IPO price whereas Pershing Square's are exercisable at a 20% premium, and Pershing Square has agreed not to exercise its warrants for three years after the closing of the acquisition.\n\nWhy it's 'groundbreaking'\n\nBut this is not the really groundbreaking feature of the Tontine compensation structure. The truly remarkable departure from SPAC standard terms is that Pershing Square is not taking any founders shares. By removing this egregious compensation element, Pershing Square really shows their allegiance to their investors. Pershing Square's sole compensation for founding and capitalizing the SPAC and sourcing, negotiating and closing a $10B+ acquisition will be a 6.21% promote after the investors have already received a 20% return. To put it another way, under Pershing Square's warrant-only compensation structure, Pershing Square does not receive any compensation until after the shareholders receive a 20% return, whereas under the typical founders shares compensation structure (as illustrated by the Goldman Sachs and Third Point SPACs above), the shareholders do not see any return until after the company receives a 20% return. Furthermore, Pershing Square paid $67.8 million for these warrants, money they do not get back if a deal is not procured and closed. So, why did Pershing Square wait almost 10 years after its extremely successful Justice Holdings SPAC to do another one? The answer is market environment.\n\nWhat's different now\n\nPershing Square started working on Justice Holdings right after the financial crisis, when there was an extreme level of uncertainty in the markets. Uncertainty is the mortal enemy of IPOs \u2014 until the day of the IPO, companies are not sure what price they will get, how much money they will raise and if it will even happen during times of ultra-volatility in the markets. Pershing Square patiently waited for that market environment to repeat itself, except this time in the form of a global pandemic and a presidential election. With COVID-19 surges coming or not coming and vaccines coming or not coming depending on the day, there is too much uncertainty in the markets over the next nine months or so for companies to risk an IPO, particularly a $5 billion IPO. Isn't it much easier to go public through a SPAC where you know exactly how much you are getting for your shares and have a contractual obligation from the acquirer? Moreover, management does not have to deal with the loss of focus inherent in an IPO and all of the meetings, issues and road shows. The only uncertainty in a SPAC is if the acquirer will approve it or if its shareholders will choose to redeem instead. Well, Pershing Square's structure has taken a lot of that uncertainty away as well. The transaction will not necessarily require shareholder approval, just board approval; and the possibility of redeeming shareholders was greatly mitigated because of the Tontine-style warrants, the fact that Pershing Square will be investing over a billion dollars of its own money and because unlike most SPACs, shareholders are not looking at a 20% dilution from Founders shares. So, the $64 million question (or $5.5 billion question in this case) is what kind of company is Pershing Square looking for and when is it likely to happen.\n\nFinding the right match\n\nPershing Square is looking for a minority position and we are assuming they will have $5.5 billion of capital. We also believe it will be just one large company they will be spending the money on. By prospectus, they have to spend at least 80% of their capital. If you assume they would want at least 10% of the company, that makes the target worth between $8.8 and $55 billion. Pershing Square will look for a company with similar characteristics as its activist investments: a simple, high-quality, high return on capital business that generates predictable growing cash flows that can be estimated within a reasonable range over the long term. The types of companies it will be looking at will be: (i) a high-quality, well-managed, large capitalization company that is looking for a better alternative to an IPO, such as Rocket Mortgage, which just recently filed for an IPO; (ii) a \"mature unicorn\" \u2014 a high-quality, venture-backed business that has achieved significant scale, market share, competitive dominance and cash flow that does not have as much private funding options as it used to due to the problems at Softbank and the ramifications to the venture market from companies like WeWork; (iii) large private equity portfolio companies that have become distressed due to their typically highly leveraged balance sheets and will require substantial equity infusions to withstand the impact of the current crisis; and (iv) large, high-quality, private family-owned companies that now are required to raise capital due to the economic downturn caused by the COVID\u201319 pandemic. How long will this take? Well, by prospectus, they have 2 years to sign a deal and then six months to close thereafter. But it will not take nearly that long. The crisis that has made this the perfect environment for this strategy will last for about another nine months. We expect Pershing Square to find the company by then. There are only approximately 150 companies that fit their parameters, so they likely already have their top ten wish list, including obvious companies that pop out such as Airbnb and Bloomberg.\n\nThe perfect opportunity", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/bill-ackman-and-tontine-holdings-rewrite-the-terms-for-spacs.html", "author": ["Kenneth Squire"]}, {"title": "CEOs reflect on tough quarter, but also offer some good news on earnings calls", "text": "Coca-Cola President and CEO James Quincey attends a press conference with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president and China Mengniu Dairy CEO and Executive Director, as part of the 134th Session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) at the SwissTech Convention Centre in Lausanne, on June 24, 2019.\n\nWith so few companies providing numerical guidance, investors are listening carefully to earnings conference calls for some hint \u2014 any hint \u2014 on what is going on.\n\nHere are some comments from CEOs in the last day or so, on tobacco, gasoline, RV, truck and can sales.\n\nThe main thing that stands out from earnings conference calls so far: It's really tough figuring out what is going on.

Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe,\" CEO H\u00e5kan Samuelsson referred to the vehicles as a \"bridge technology.\"\n\n\n\nAs a company, Volvo Cars has said it wants \"around 50%\" of the cars it sells to be \"pure electric\" by the year 2025, with the other half sold as hybrids. On the topic of new energy vehicles needing government incentives to drive sales, Samuelsson said he thought that \"long term, we need to have sustainable concepts that can be sold on (their) \u2026 own merits.\"\n\n\n\n\"But of course, in the first transition years governmental support for electric cars would be very helpful and even more helpful would be support to develop a charging network.\"\n\n\n\nIndeed, \"range anxiety\" \u2014 an idea that electric vehicles are not able to undertake long journeys without losing power \u2014 has long been seen as a potential barrier to electric vehicle uptake.

Charging infrastructure will also be introduced to existing drive-thru restaurants where feasible, with the technology rolled out to new drive-thrus \"as standard.\"\n\n\n\nAround the world, governments are attempting to incentivize the uptake of electric vehicles. In Norway, which is often cited as a model for low emission cars, the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association says that electric vehicles do not have to pay annual road tax, have \"access to bus lanes\" and are exempt from 25% value added tax on purchases, among other things. According to the association, these incentives are in place \"until the end of 2021\", when the government will make revisions to them.\n\n\n\nGovernments are also making efforts to improve charging infrastructure.

As of Tuesday, the Thai baht had lost around 6% against the U.S. dollar while the benchmark stock index, SET Index, has fallen close to 13% so far this year.\n\n'Intense jockeying for cabinet seats'\n\nThe ministers' resignations followed earlier reports of a power struggle within the ruling coalition's largest party, Palang Pracharath. The party and its political partners control a slim majority in Thailand's 500-member House of Representatives. Before their resignation from the government, four of the ministers \u2014 including former Finance Minister Uttama \u2014 quit Palang Pracharath as party members, reported the Associated Press. Uttama was leader of the pro-military party.\n\nHarrison Cheng, associate director and lead analyst for Thailand at consultancy Control Risks, said the cabinet reshuffle has triggered an \"intense jockeying\" for government positions among members of the ruling coalition. That could also worsen infighting among members, he added. He explained in a note last week that the prime minister's plan to recruit \"reputable individuals\" from the public and private sectors to lead several economic ministries will \"trigger deep resentment\" among the different political factions.\n\nDisagreements are likely to flare up both within the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) and among coalition members, and could delay the finalisation of the reshuffle by up to two months. Harrison Cheng Control Risks\n\nStill, the Prayuth government is likely to stay intact as parties within the ruling coalition have little to gain from withdrawing, said Cheng. The opposition also doesn't have the numbers to challenge the ruling coalition, he added. \"Disagreements are likely to flare up both within the Palang Pracharath Party (PPRP) and among coalition members, and could delay the finalisation of the reshuffle by up to two months, which is likely to hurt investor confidence,\" wrote Cheng. Prayuth has reportedly invited a top Thai banker to join his new cabinet lineup. Some local media reports also named the country's outgoing central bank governor Veerathai Santiprabhob as a possible candidate \u2014 but Reuters reported that Veerathai has ruled out joining the new cabinet.\n\nPolitical uncertainty 'not new'\n\nThe Thai economy, which is heavily dependent on tourism, is expected to register the worst economic contraction in Asia this year, according to forecasts by Capital Economics. The consultancy projected Thailand's gross domestic product to slump by 9% in 2020.

In the first two weeks of this month, the Shanghai composite rocketed 14%. The CSI 300 index jumped more than 20%, and the Shenzhen composite soared 17%.\n\nThat rally drove the China Securities Regulatory Commission to issue a warning to investors to stay away from lenders that are illegally providing financing for margin trading. Margin trading comes with risks as investors are using borrowed money, and therefore any losses in the investments will be magnified as traders would need to pay back the interest as well.\n\nWilliam Ma, chief investment officer at Chinese asset management firm Noah Holdings, told CNBC on Tuesday that his firm is monitoring margin trading levels among retail investors. \"Trend levels is about half of the peak, so we believe the rally will continue. At the same time, we (must be) aware that we are only 20% away from peak valuations in recent years,\" he said.\n\n\"The recent stock rally is a double-edged sword for Chinese policymakers,\" ANZ Research added in a Monday report, which also warned of the risks of margin trading.\n\nOn the one hand, it said, those inflows are helpful in curbing corporate debt, which has risen due to the influx of credit this year. As the coronavirus crisis hits businesses, authorities have pumped billions of yuan into the banking system encouraging lenders to extend credit and cut interest rates. As a result, however, the amount of bad loans in the country is expected to snowball.\n\nANZ added that as the corporate debt load eases, the fiscal pressure can be relieved as well, pointing out that the government holds a majority stake in publicly listed state-owned companies.\n\n\"On the other hand, there are growing concerns of financial risks regarding shadow margin trading, which caused the 2015 market crash,\" it warned.\n\nAccording to data from China Securities Financial Corporation, which refinances margin trading and has liquidity support from China's central bank, margin financing loans in June were 33% higher than in May. In the first week of July, the margin balance outstanding in China accelerated 9% to 1.3 trillion yuan, according to a South China Morning Post report.\n\nSome platforms illegally financing margin trading were allowing investors to borrow over 1,000 yuan ($143) to buy stocks for a deposit of as little as 100 yuan, a leverage of 10 times, according to Chinese media Caixin Global.\n\nIn 2015, there was a similar boom and bust in China fueled by illegal margin lending that saw the Shanghai composite fall more than 40% from its peak in just a few weeks, according to Reuters.

In late March during the early stages of the pandemic, LabCorp was running about 20,000 tests per day.\n\n\"We're continuing to increase capacity every single week over week,\" he said. \"The problem is that the number of tests being asked to be performed each week is growing faster than the capacity that we can build.\"\n\nFor someone in the hospital, LabCorp is able to return Covid-19 tests results within 1.5 days on average, Schechter said. Average turnaround time is about three to five days for someone who isn't in the hospital, he said, while a range of about two to three days is needed to have an \"effective ability to track and trace people that are sick or have been exposed to people.\"\n\nLike LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics also has warned that its turnaround time for testing results has slowed as transmission of the virus spreads in certain parts of the U.S., especially across the American South, Southwest and West.\n\nTesting for Covid-19 in the U.S. has been beset by challenges since the early days of the pandemic, including strains on the supply chain.

The national average in April was about 174,000 diagnostic tests per day, per a CNBC analysis.\n\nThe overall rise in new Covid-19 cases in the U.S. can only be partly attributed to added testing capacity. That's because the test positivity rate also has increased, an indication of how broadly the virus is spreading throughout a community.\n\nThe U.S. has an 8.5% positivity rate, based on a seven-day moving average, according to Johns Hopkins University. In early June, the seven-day moving average had dropped below 5% nationally.

Lars Baron | Getty Images\n\nGermany, like many other countries, had a contingent of people who fought lockdowns and argued that Covid-19 was a hoax. But it also had a handful of prominent scientists communicating regularly and openly with the public. That played a huge role in drowning out rumors and misinformation, locals tell CNBC. \"We have a great educational system and everyone has access to it,\" said Dennis Traub, a tech worker in Hamburg, Germany. \"So I believe that many people and the majority listened to both sides and one of those sides sounded much more reasonable.\"\n\nChristian Drosten, Director of the Institute of Virology, speaks about the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV, February 13, 2020. Britta Pedersen | picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nOn the side of science, virologist Christian Drosten grew his podcast, \"Das Coronavirus-Update\" to millions of followers in the early days of the pandemic. Drosten is now a cult icon in Germany akin to Dr. Tony Fauci in the United States. He doesn't dumb down the science. Instead, he shares complex ideas in an accessible way and gets real with the public about aspects of the virus that are not well understood. In addition to that, the public regularly hears from the (now very well-known) Minister of Health Jens Spahn, as well as Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel.\n\nIn April, Merkel drew from her own science background by walking Germans through the basic reproductive number (the \"R0\") -- a mathematical term that indicates how contagious a virus is -- as a way to instill confidence in lockdowns. Moreover, Germans say their children got educated on the coronavirus via popular television shows like \"Die Sendung mit der Maus\" (Germany's equivalent to \"Sesame Street\"). Germans say the guidelines now are clear. \"If you have a set of rules that are communicated well, people don't feel like they're on their own,\" said Florian Otto, a German health tech entrepreneur who co-founded the payments start-up Cedar. \"And when people know what to do, they encourage each other.\" Hospitals weren't overwhelmed Hospitals in Germany were not overwhelmed by Covid-19. That meant doctors could even treat patients from neighboring countries, including Italy and Spain, where critically ill people were airlifted in. How did that happen? Well, in March, Germany's hospital system started freeing up intensive care beds and pushing back elective surgeries to make space for a potential flood of Covid-19 patients. Many hospitals also shared data with a federal website to map out their supply chain needs relative to other facilities. \"The website is (now) a live-dashboard of all available ICU beds in participating hospitals Germany wide,\" said Niklas Rindtorff, a medical student in his final year of studies in Heidelberg, Germany, who also has a background in medical informatics.\n\nHospital doctors are instructed how to operate a ventilator at the Universitaetsklinikum Eppendorf in Hamburg, on March 25, 2020. Axel Heimken | POOL | AFP | Getty Images\n\nGermany also built out extra intensive care facilities just in case. \"After the collapse of the hospitals in northern Italy, the German government built up additional capacities in the intensive care units,\" said Uwe Frers, an entrepreneur based in Berlin. \"This was the right step, even if the capacities were ultimately not needed.\" Some experts believe that Germany's high-quality intensive care -- as well as its focus on testing -- helped reduce the mortality of the disease in the country. Germany has one of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases, but relatively few citizens died compared with other European nations. Some experts are even referring to the phenomenon as the \"German anomaly.\" Mental health support After sheltering in place, many Germans were encouraged to exercise outdoors as long as they were able to keep their distance from others. There was also a concerted effort to encourage Germans to stay in contact via Skype or Zoom, so people wouldn't feel lonely or isolated. \"There was a big campaign around mental health,\" said Dr. Sandra Kamping, a psychologist based in Hamburg. \"Here people could go outside even during lockdown for a walk or a bike ride,\" added Carlos Barragan, an IT worker based in Germany.\n\nNurse Sylke Pflugmacher takes a sample at a testing point for medical staff members at the community hospital in Magdeburg, eastern Germany, on April 16, 2020 during the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Ronny Hartmann | AFP | Getty Images\n\nAccess to doctors Germany is known for its strong network of family practitioners, who are typically the first point of contact for accessing health care. \"There is very low barrier to entry to see a high-quality doctor,\" said Christian Dierks, a lawyer focused on medicine who runs an innovation consultancy firm in Berlin. \"Sick leave is also very easy, and you can take time off from work to see your doctor.\" Because of that, some locals say, citizens were able to access some routine care and get advice if they were experiencing symptoms of Covid-19. In some cases, they were told to stay home while others with more serious symptoms were referred to the hospital. That might have helped Germans navigate to the right place.

Peter Kneffel | Pool via Reuters\n\nWhat went OK\n\nStates making their own decisions In Germany, the federal government and the states haven't always agreed about the right next steps during the pandemic. In some ways, that lack of consistency isn't helpful. But others point out that it's also an opportunity to share lessons learned: \"Germany's federal system gives the individual states a very high degree of freedom in choosing the means of overcoming the crisis,\" said Frers. \"On the one hand good for learning from each other, on the other hand critical when quick decisions have to be made on a large scale.\"\n\nCitizens walk at the pedestrian zone in Guetersloh, western Germany.

It may still not be enough as the country reopens -- a point that the local press have emphasized -- but it's better than most. \"We are very good in testing because we have a centralized but still coordinated testing system,\" said Christian Angermayer, an entrepreneur and investor from Germany. \"Almost from the beginning, we had widespread testing.\" Contact tracing apps When Germany released an app for contact tracing, called the Corona-Warn-App, more than 15 million people signed up. \"Many people downloaded it, representing a huge chunk of the population in Germany,\" said Otto. Germany's Health Ministry has reported some success: More than 500 people who tested positive used the app to notify others who might have been exposed. Health officials noted that the apps were designed with privacy in mind, but reports indicate that no system is perfect. One recent issue that's emerged is that Google Android users must first turn on their device location, which could allow Google to follow their movements. Still, Germany embraced tracking (both the tech and more traditional, analog version) and testing early on, which may have contributed to its success.\n\nGermany's coronavirus contact-tracing app, Corona-Warn, is displayed on an iPhone in Berlin on Tuesday, June 16, 2020.

If companies were struggling, there's a program in place for employees to receive a high percentage of their usual pay rather than being laid off. The idea is that instead of having employers cut staff, workers can apply for unemployment benefits and the government will subsidize those employers directly. Some 10 million Germans are benefiting from the program, called \"Kurzabeit,\" according to Propublica. But some say that corporations might have fared better than small businesses. \"In my view, however, the small and medium-sized enterprises, which are so important in Germany, have been left behind due to a lack of lobbying power, unlike the large corporations,\" said Frers. And the programs didn't cover everyone: There has still been a bump in unemployment in Germany, which could rise further still with additional Covid-19 outbreaks.\n\nWhat could have been better\n\nMask shortages and policies In the early days of the pandemic, some Germans say it was a challenge to access masks. The problem was so stark that a group of doctors in late April even posed nude to raise awareness of the problem of personal protective equipment shortages. The idea was to show the public how vulnerable they were without protection. In response, many Germans banded together to start making their own masks, including to sew them. \"I received at least five offers (of masks) from family and friends,\" said junior doctor Pascal Nohl-Deryk, who noted that his hospital also started sharing masks for his own personal use. Now, he says, masks are available across Germany at low prices. One other issue that's come up recently is whether to mandate the use of masks in supermarkets. There's some debate about it, but some doctors say that politicians should support the measure. \"There's enough scientific evidence about transmission in indoor spaces,\" said Dr. Harald Schneider, an endocrinologist based in Germany. \"I'm convinced we need strong measures.\" Rumors and conspiracy theories Germany may have had an enviable Covid-19 response, but it still had its fair share of conspiracy theories. As local reporters have shared, groups of protesters have mobilized to share unfounded rumors and misinformation. Some accused Bill Gates of forcing vaccinations on the population, while others targeted Merkel. Drosten, the popular virologist, received death threats and was accused of spreading fear about the coronavirus. \"For many Germans, I'm the evil guy who is crippling the economy,\" Drosten told the Guardian. Problems with easing lockdowns Going into lockdown may have been easier for Germany than getting out. After watching Italy and China, Germany began to get prepared and was relatively early in imposing restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19. But as one local outlet points out, it could have even come sooner. Still, Germany used its time well and the lockdown, by all accounts, was fairly effective in combating the spread of the virus. However, some have noted that Germany may have been a victim of its own success. Because some citizens didn't have much exposure to the virus, they questioned whether the measures were too draconian. And once the country decided to reopen, some states rushed to open faster than others -- (critics felt there could have been a more cohesive national strategy). Meanwhile, as recent outbreaks have struck a few regions, Germany has started to impose restrictions once again.\n\nHow Germany scores overall: 8.25/10", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/germanys-coronavirus-response-masterful-science-communication.html", "author": ["Christina Farr"]}, {"title": "Stock futures under pressure from U.S.-China tensions, earnings onslaught", "text": "U.S. stock futures fell in early trading Wednesday amid renewed U.S.-China tensions and ahead of major technology earnings from Microsoft and Tesla after the closing bell.\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 58 points, or 0.2%.

The race is on to combat the coronavirus. Since the outbreak was first identified at the start of this year, pharmaceutical giants and institutions have been grabbing headlines as they roll out trials at breakneck speed. But behind the scenes, many more businesses have been playing their part to keep the virus under control and identify symptoms at source. That has sparked major innovations in the field of medical technology, with repercussions likely to be felt long into the future. CNBC Make It spoke to three start-up entrepreneurs to get the pulse on how they're changing the face of healthcare under the pandemic.\n\nHow the doctor will see you now\n\nThe World Health Organization describes medical technology, or medtech, as the use of knowledge and technology in devices, medicines, and procedures to advance human health. One aspect of that which has been vital lately is telemedicine \u2014 or remote health-care services \u2014 as more people seek medical advice from the safety of their homes.\n\nJohannes Schildt, co-founder and CEO of Swedish telemedicine start-up Kry. Kry\n\nThat's a function 32-year-old Swedish entrepreneur, Johannes Schildt, and his co-founders have been providing for the past five years with their medical video consultation service, Kry. Also known as Livi in English-speaking markets, the platform connects users in Europe with qualified doctors as an alternative to in-person care. But since the outbreak, that offering has taken on new significance, said Schildt. \"(Now) with the rather sad backdrop of a pandemic, it's starting to be painfully obvious for a lot of people that this is a crucial part of their health-care infrastructure.\" Between February and April, as more and more countries entered lockdown, demand on the app surged 160%, both for Covid-19 queries and general care. Meanwhile, more health-care professionals joined the platform to supplement their incomes.\n\nIt has really opened the eyes of a lot of people ... what we have been doing for five years is really a good thing. Johannes Schildt co-founder and CEO, Kry\n\nThe growing need for remote health-care services has also led to an easing of regulations, which traditionally prevented the adoption of telemedicine in some markets. Schildt said he hopes the move could help make digital health care more accessible. In April, the company rolled out Livi Connect, a free basic service, to users in the U.S. \"You've had nations that were not allowed to do telemedicine, and it was not reimbursed. But this is now rapidly changing across the globe,\" said Schildt. \"It has really opened the eyes of a lot of people and entities that what we have been doing for five years is really a good thing.\"\n\nPredicting Covid-19 symptoms\n\nThe recent evolution of medtech has also led to a wave of wearable devices designed to put individuals' health data in their own hands. Ranging from watches to rings, the devices collect physiological data \u2014 such as changes in heart rate, body temperature and sleep patterns \u2014 to provide a picture of a user's overall health. But during the pandemic, some have also helped identify early symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nHarpreet Singh Rai, CEO of Finnish healthtech start-up Oura. Oura\n\nThat was the case for Finnish smart health tracker Oura. Indeed, while the titanium Oura ring had been successful in predicting previous flu seasons, CEO Harpreet Singh Rai said the company was first alerted to the device's coronavirus capabilities by a user. The man had returned from a skiing trip in early March when a drop in his Oura \"readiness\" score prompted him to go for a coronavirus test. \"He described himself as asymptomatic, which he thought made this virus so dangerous,\" said Singh Rai. \"(He) told people about his experience with Oura and seeing such meaningful changes in data that allowed him to understand that he may be sick.\"\n\nIf someone is really elevated on the risk score ... they suggest that a second test be done. Harpreet Singh Rai CEO, Oura\n\nIn light of the discovery, the company is now finding ways to use that data to help detect cases among frontline workers and general users. That also includes partnering with athletes to get the sports calendar back on track. According to Singh Rai, the NBA bought more than 1,000 rings in June, which cost upwards of $300 each, as their season resumes at the end of the month. \"We work really, really hard with both the NBA and the NBPA, which is essentially their union, to make sure that players felt secure about their data,\" said Singh Rai. \"(So) our team came up with this idea of a risk score,\" he continued. \"If someone is really elevated on the risk score, they ... call the team medical doctor and they suggest that a second test be done for Covid.\"\n\nMaking research representative\n\nAs medtech devices become more widely used, they also present opportunities to improve medical research. In the face of new and unpredictable diseases like the coronavirus, that research is vital to help stop the spread. That's something 30-year-old Lea von Bidder, co-founder and CEO of Swiss women's health company, Ava, aims to help with \u2014 by offering insights on how Covid-19 affects different groups of society. Specifically, that includes the impact on women.\n\nLea von Bidder, co-founder and CEO of Swiss healthcare start-up Ava. Ava\n\n\"In the past we've had the issue where women weren't included in clinical studies because they were quote, unquote 'too complex' for whatever was studied,\" said von Bidder. The company's flagship product, the Ava Bracelet, launched in 2016 to help women track their fertility cycles. It has since helped more than 30,000 couples get pregnant in Europe and the U.S. Now, von Bidder and her team are using that anonymized data to provide a clearer picture of women's physiological patterns.\n\nWe understand the 'normal' for women really, really well, which is important now when we look at Covid.

Bahamas welcomed, then shut out U.S. travelers", "text": "Less than three weeks after reopening to international travelers, the Bahamas is closing its borders to U.S. residents after a rise of coronavirus infections on the island nation. In a national address on July 19, Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis announced that airports and seaports would close to all travelers except those coming from Canada, the U.K. and EU starting July 22 at midnight. While he did not specifically single out American tourists, that country has accounted for most of the Bahamas' stopover visitors \u2014 more than 78% as of 2016. \"I understand the frustration and disappointment of many Bahamians and residents that may ensue as we reimplement certain restrictions,\" Minnis said. \"But as a country ... we have to do what is right and we have to do what is necessary.\" He said Bahamasair, the Bahamas national airline, will immediately cease all flights to the U.S. too.\n\n(The situation) deteriorated at an exponential rate since we reopened our international borders. Hubert Minnis prime minister of the Bahamas\n\nA record-breaking 7.2 million tourists visited the Bahamas in 2019, despite the devastation inflicted by Hurricane Dorian last year. Most of those visitors were from the United States. The Bahamas is the closest Caribbean island to U.S. shores. One of its islands, Bimini, lies about 50 miles east of Miami and is reachable via charter boat or a two-hour fast ferry departing from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The travel reversal is a new blow to American travelers, who after being locked out of the EU, were welcomed by many Caribbean islands earlier this summer.\n\nWhat happened in the Bahamas\n\nAs of July 19, the Bahamas' Ministry of Health confirmed 49 new cases of Covid-19 since the country reopened its borders to international travelers on July 1. Of these, 31 were on the popular island of Grand Bahama, which had gone more than two months without any cases before the borders reopened.\n\nThree islands \u2014 New Providence (shown here), Grand Bahama and Bimini \u2014 account nearly all coronavirus infections in the Bahamas. Justin Crowder / EyeEm | EyeEm | Getty Images\n\nIn total, the Bahamas, which has nearly 400,000 people, has confirmed 153 cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. \"Regrettably, the situation here at home has already deteriorated since we began the reopening of our domestic economy,\" said Minnis, adding that it \"deteriorated at an exponential rate since we reopened our international borders.\"\n\nHow the Bahamas responded\n\nMinnis announced additional measures to help curb the spread of Covid-19: \u00b7 Beaches and parks on New Providence, Paradise Island, Grand Bahama and other locations have been closed. \u00b7 Restaurants at Arawak Cay and Potter's Cay will also be closed until better social distancing can be practiced and enforced.\n\nGrenada stands apart for its cautious reopening approach. Buena Vista Images\n\n\u00b7 Grand Bahama only: A daily curfew from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. is in effect, and international and domestic borders will be closed effective July 22. Indoor dining is not allowed and bars are closed. Church services, weddings, funerals and sports activities are no longer permitted, and fines will be issued for flouting social distancing and mask rules. Minnis warned that if cases continue to rise, the Bahamas could go on lockdown as early as July 24.\n\nHow others are approaching U.S. travelers\n\nMany Caribbean nations \u2014 such as Antigua, Aruba, Bermuda, Jamaica and St. Lucia \u2014 had either already reopened, or were on the precipice of reopening, when U.S. coronavirus cases started to surge in mid-to-late June. Caribbean countries quickly began adding stricter measures, such as negative Covid-19 tests, to enter. Grenada, however, took a different approach. Citing an increase in infection rates, especially in the U.S., it delayed reopening. On July 10, Grenada announced a three-tiered approach to begin on August 1: \u00b7 Low-risk countries, such as other Caribbean nations, can take a rapid test upon arrival. Those testing positive must take a Covid-19 PCR test, which if positive would require a 14-day quarantine or two negative test results.\n\nThese Caribbean nations will not be the last to react in this manner. Mark Cameron epidemiologist, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine\n\n\u00b7 Medium-risk countries where \"there is active, but manageable transmission,\" such as Canada, the U.K. and EU nations, must present a negative Covid-19 PCR test upon arrival and undergo a rapid test upon entry, which if negative would allow \"limited movement\" thereafter. \u00b7 High-risk countries where \"there is active and widespread transmission\" (arriving mainly via charter flights and yachts) must arrive with negative PCR tests in hand, undergo rapid tests and, even if negative, must quarantine for 14 days in accommodations approved by the Ministry of Health. To date, Grenada has only had 23 confirmed Covid-19 cases, all of whom have recovered.\n\nA sign of things to come?", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/bahamas-shuts-out-americans-after-coronavirus-cases-rise-on-islands.html", "author": ["Monica Buchanan Pitrelli"]}, {"title": "Uber kicks off final appeal against major UK ruling on drivers' employment rights", "text": "In this photo illustration the Uber logo is displayed on a phone in front of Tower Bridge on November 25, 2019 in London, England.\n\nUber is taking its fight against a U.K. ruling that its drivers should be classified as workers to the country's highest court.\n\nThe ride-sharing giant will kick off a last-ditch attempt to appeal the landmark employment rights case in a two-day hearing at the Supreme Court on Tuesday.\n\nThe legal battle began back in 2016 when an employment tribunal ruled in favor of a group of Uber drivers led by Yaseen Aslam and James Farrar.

The Burj Kalifa has published a series of new videos to show visitors the efforts being made to clean and keep the attraction safe. Despite the new guidelines, visitors are not expected to encounter longer wait times. Emaar Entertainment, which operates the attraction, estimates 150 visitors every hour, a marked departure from 1,000 visitors per hour before the pandemic.\n\nTaj Mahal\n\nClosed: March 17\n\nReopening status: Still closed Not all sites are throwing open the doors. Though most of the nearly 3,700 centrally-protected monuments and archaeological sites maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India have now been reopened, the Taj Mahal is not one of them.\n\nWhen it reopens, visitors can tour the Taj Mahal with hundreds, rather than thousands, of others. smerindo_schultzpax\n\nLocal authorities decided against opening it in part because the 17th-century mausoleum is located in a containment zone, an area within a town or village that has been sealed off to prevent the spread of new infections. There were 85 containment zones in Agra as of July 18. When it does reopen, visitors to the Taj Mahal will be capped at 5,000 a day (in two segments) and be subject to time limits, reported The Indian Express. Before the pandemic, the site was known to draw 70,000 daily visitors on busy days.\n\nMilan Cathedral\n\nClosed to tourists: March 9\n\nReopened: May 29 Travelers can tour the Milan Cathedral, provided they wear masks, sanitize their hands, submit to a temperature check, and stay more than six feet away from others.\n\nOpenly wandering around the Duomo di Milano (Milan Cathedral) is no longer possible; visitors must now follow a specific route. Buena Vista Images\n\nGuests must wear gloves to use automated ticket machines and other touchscreen devices. This can be avoided by purchasing tickets in advance or on-site via their mobile phone through travel booking platform GetYourGuide. The Milan Cathedral is working with the Berlin-based platform to install sensors that are designed to give real-time crowd density information inside the cathedral. Visitors can check waiting times and congested areas via an app before they visit. \"Overall, we've reduced the Cathedral's opening hours, but new visitors are in for a treat,\" said Valentina Gallazzi, the site's visitor services manager. \"Be sure to come around sunset, as we've extended the evening opening times during the weekends to let people enjoy the view on our rooftops.\"\n\nMilan at sunset from atop the Milan Cathedral.

The Maldives reopened to international visitors this week, after being closed to visitors since March 27. While much of the world has shut its borders or enacted strict measures on incoming travelers, the Maldives will not require new arrivals to quarantine or undergo testing, other than a simple temperature check at the airport. There is one other rule: Visitors must book their entire stay at the same resort whilst visiting the South Asian country. Minister for Tourism Ali Waheed has described the impact of the pandemic as, \"more devastating than the 2004 tsunami and the 2008 global financial crisis.\" With a population of half a million, the Maldives has recorded more than 2,700 cases of Covid-19. Its government originally announced it would require visitors to pay a new $100 visa fee and $100 for a Covid-19 test at the airport, plus stay a minimum of 14 nights. It has since dropped those requirements. Airlines, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, are resuming services to the island nation. Despite the nation being open for business, hotels are only gradually reopening, with Conrad Maldives Rangali Island planning to reopen at the end of September, and St. Regis and all other Marriott International hotels in the Maldives not planning to reopen until October.\n\nOn-site hotel testing eases anxieties \u2014 for some\n\nOne resort, however, reopened immediately with new measures designed to stay clear of the virus. Guests of Soneva Fushi will be given a mask upon arrival and be tested for Covid-19. Guests are then required to stay in their room or villa until their test results come back, which could take between six and 24 hours. If they receive negative test results, guests can roam freely, but must still conduct daily temperature checks. On the fourth day of their trip, an additional test will be carried out. \"You might consider that this is excessive and that we're being overcautious,\" said Sonu Shivdasani, CEO of Soneva, in a corporate video explaining the process. Yet his aim is \"to make all our private islands Covid-free environments so the guests can truly relax and engage with our hosts (and) fellow guests.\" A socially-distanced guest experience simply didn't appeal to Shivdasani. \"Life is about relationships, you know, the secret of life is about the friendships you make,\" Shivdasani told CNBC. \"This idea of our guests distancing from each other, we felt would be a real challenge and we didn't want them to feel uncomfortable engaging with others.\"\n\n\"For the urban rich, luxury is about sitting outside in the open air.\" Sonu Shivdasani Soneva CEO\n\nIn fact, 55% of its revenue is generated by repeat guests, whom he said often mingle with one another. One factor that could lure tourists to the Maldives is its desolate nature, especially compared to say, a beach club in Mykonos. Also, many health experts have said being outdoors poses a lower risk for contracting Covid-19 than being indoors. \"The urban rich have all the famous designer restaurants in their cities, the famous branded chefs in air-conditioned environments,\" Shivdasani said. \"For the urban rich, luxury is about sitting outside in the open air.\" Soneva thinks its tight health measures could pay off. The hotel said reservations for August are higher than last year. Yet, not everyone was willing to undergo its new policies. \"We've had one or two who feel it's unnecessary and didn't want to put their children through this difficulty,\" he said, \"but most have said that's actually reassured them, and I've received lots of emails say, 'Fantastic, bravo. I was thinking about where to go, but I'm now coming to stay with you.'\"\n\nHotels are ramping up cleaning services\n\nHilton, meanwhile, which has three resorts operating under its brands in the Maldives, will be gradually opening with new measures in place, including staff temperature checks and increased cleaning procedures. Nils-Arne Schroeder, vice president of luxury and lifestyle for Hilton's Asia Pacific hotels, outlined the company's new measures to CNBC: \"You didn't want to see the people cleaning your public areas in the lobby; it was always cleaned in the night. Nowadays, you want to see them actually during the day so you know the hotel is looking after the cleaning.\" Last month, Hilton rolled out new guidelines for its properties worldwide. Called Hilton CleanStay, one measure includes putting a seal on the doors after cleaning a room to visibly show customers that nobody has since entered.\n\nA socially-distanced sand bank dinner at Soneva Fushi. Courtesy of Soneva Fushi\n\nGuests staying at Hilton properties will have their temperatures checked, but will not be required to take Covid-19 tests. \"You can make decisions if you want to be distanced from everyone else because you can be in your villa, you can have in-villa dining all day, you can jump into your ocean ... but if you want to be part of the island community, of course, we are ready for you, to make sure that the self-distancing is available,\" Schroeder said.\n\nWill tourists be willing to travel if they must quarantine after?\n\nMarriott International plans to reopen its Maldives resorts in October and is implementing new policies, such as requiring guests to sit at the same table each day for breakfast. But, whether travelers feel safe enough to travel or leave their hometown and be subjected to restrictions, is yet to be determined. For instance, Hong Kong residents who leave the city must take a Covid-19 test upon their return and they are required to quarantine for 14-days while wearing a location-tracking wristband.\n\nSome resorts in the Maldives are requiring guests undergo Covid-19 tests, while others are not.

In financial and macro-economy terms, be it the global financial crisis of 2008 or the current COVID-19 pandemic, we, as humans, don\u2019t shy away from finding a silver lining. Angel and seed investments witnessed a growth of 34 per cent during the 2008 crisis, with similar increase in the deal amount, proving that the investors always keep themselves open to opportunities. They are always on a look-out for innovative brains, especially in times when fear is high.\n\nThe air around COVID-19 pandemic in the beginning was that of uncertainty, speculations were rife during the lockdown period, especially with the entrepreneurs. The response was varied with some like Ola, Zomato and Oyo resorted to downsizing, laying off over a thousand employees, to some trending towards frugality pivoting towards survival.\n\nGenerally, an economic downturn isn\u2019t necessarily a degradation for an economy on a micro level. It can also be perceived as a reset with sky as the limit with opportunities, acting as a booster for many hidden ideas as they devise solutions to overcome the crisis. Every business focuses on connecting with the masses, be it education, grocery, entertainment or fitness. Many startups have begun leveraging the power of \u2018online\u2019 to reach the masses and provide them services and products that people would need while being locked inside their houses, along with working remotely. As entrepreneurs leverage the downturn, it\u2019s time investors to back these daring entrepreneurs\u2019 initiatives.\n\nThere is enough evidence in history that some of the most disrupting business ideas have emerged from the most devastating economic downturns (Read Airbnb and Uber). Sectors such as e-commerce, edtech, healthtech, gaming, grocery and OTT are already experiencing a meteoric rise in the number of customers during the lockdown making Indian economy more resilient. A number of startups in these sectors have received funding during the lockdown, as the investors see a huge opportunity in them and believe in their ideas and technology. Milkbasket, a leading grocery startup, recently funded by Inflection Point Ventures (IPV) had almost the same panel of investors in their Series A and B rounds. Similarly, BigBasket raised a bridge funding round from its previous investor during the lockdown at the same valuation as it did last year. This shows how the investors are ready to invest, for they see an opportunity in these sectors. This pandemic might be once in a lifetime opportunity for them, not only for VC funds having dry powder available, but also for angel investors who have the foresightedness to bet on a great business and founding team.\n\nAlso, with falling valuations, most investors look forward to invest particularly during this lockdown.\n\nThough the pandemic offers a significant opportunity for the investors, it\u2019s important for them to be equally confident about their investments. Investment firms need to repose this confidence by sharing the optimistic side of this pandemic. Investor confidence needs to developed by thorough investor education and deeply connected network. Angel investment platforms like IPV ensure extensive due diligence of startups led by industry experts, towards earning the trust of their investors. More importantly, the firms need to proactively utilise this lockdown period towards detailed engagement with the investors. Also, the market has been witnessing a huge addition of angel investors annually. With real estate and stock market not delivering well in the last five years, startup investing has emerged as a lucrative asset class. This new set of investors need to be wisely educated, to make them understand why this is the best time for them to invest.\n\nWhile many VCs are in a wait and watch mode to resume their funding in startups, it\u2019s time that the key investment platforms rather diligently identify startups with high opportunities and fair valuation. During COVID, the investors need to bet on good founder driven startups building their businesses in a cost-controlled environment, so they get liquidity for the next 12-18 months. Though the pandemic has upended many global organizations with huge capital, the Indian startup ecosystem seems to have a grip on the situation now. With more ideas floating in, the investment sector ensures it doesn\u2019t lose its pace and continues to keep its eye open for few startups which might go on to become the leading organisations in the future. The sense of urgency that this lockdown has brought us, has only helped the entrepreneurs stay on top of their game, building more ideas and products, helping the nation as a whole, and reinstating the confidence in the investors. The growing number of funding rounds during the lockdown period is a testament of the confidence investors have in the Indian startup ecosystem, strengthening the idea of the pandemic being an opportunity for them.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353582", "author": ["Ankur Mittal"]}, {"title": "Intimate Wedding: Photos to Click and What to Keep in Mind", "text": "July 22, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\n\u201cIntimate weddings\u201d is a very engaging and social media-friendly word which has found its grounding in this pandemic struck wedding world. Weddings are enjoyable and relatively easier when you are surrounded by your close family and friends and if anything this global pandemic has made this a norm.\n\nFrom the onset of Covid-19, we have personally seen some of our confirmed weddings getting postponed and some cancellations too. It\u2019s heartbreaking as the couples put in a lot of effort into the planning stages only to see the execution not happening. We really sympathize with all the couples who were supposed to get married during this time and had to postpone their celebrations.\n\nHowever, we need to adjust to this new normal and take new directions, going with the flow and taking steps to make your big day a memorable one.

It helps you envision your spendings and allocate funds accordingly.\n\nOutdoor all the way\n\nWeddings at home can get cramped up especially if it isn\u2019t in a farmhouse. Always keep in mind to have ample light (sunlight/natural light) and space on your side. If you have a backyard or a terrace then make use of it. Natural light results in beautiful images automatically. A well-lit venue ensures you have good memories so make sure that your ceremony is either in the morning or sunset hours to use the good soft and golden light.\n\nDecor Elements\n\nIt's a good idea to have a professional wedding planner or decorator help you with the budget you have.

Ethics are the morals and principals that govern a person's behaviour. It means to be able to differentiate between what is right or wrong, and what is good or bad. People with robust work ethics perform their work with full dedication. It makes them stand out from the rest who may try to dodge hard work. The one with strong ethics never loses focus from their goals. They put persistent efforts, leading them to produce high-quality work consistently.\n\nIn today\u2019s corporate era, business ethics or code of ethics are buzzwords. The reason behind this is the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) world we are all in. Here information, definitions, directions might not be clear, and employees have to rely on guidelines and their judgments to stay on the right side. Above all, the pressure to succeed in a highly competitive world and taking short cuts or driving short term benefits might take precedence over being morally on the right side, especially if lines are blurred.\n\nAccording to few people ethics can be taught while some say, it depends upon how a person has been raised, if he or she was made to distinguish between being morally right and being ethically wrong. It basically demonstrates that all the ethics courses online are useless. But psychologists today say that ethics consists of knowing what we ought to do, and such knowledge can be taught.\n\nProfessionalism is the conduct, behaviour, and attitude of a person in a work or a corporate environment. Professionalism can, indeed, be taught, and it has been for centuries, but not in the classroom. Instead, it is taught in the hidden curriculum at work, where professional behaviours are recognized and promoted while unprofessional practices get penalised, directly or indirectly, sooner or later.\n\nUnderlying professionalism and ethics are values such as integrity, commitment, sensitivity and respect, and civic sense. Being professional requires ethical behaviour that drives interactions with employees, customers, and leaders. It is based on how someone performs their job, takes decisions, and how their work is perceived in the organisation.\n\nProfessionalism and ethics \u2013 Non-negotiable at work\n\nIn today\u2019s environment, where the COVID pandemic has spiraled the term VUCA into a completely new and unprecedented dimension, professionalism and ethics have become even more essential than ever before.\n\nSuccess\n\nOrganisations require committed professionals who will perform while abiding by the code of ethics, commitment, and resilience. Short term attitude might prove to be detrimental for the organisation and hence will not be welcomed. Therefore, to become long term talent, professionalism, and ethics are crucial. A team member who is extremely intelligent and talented but with poor work ethics will only harm the organisation.\n\nChecking Tool\n\nWorkplace ethics act as a moral compass and provide employees with the guidelines for decision making in situations that appear grey. It\u2019s always better to err on the side of caution than to take a risk. In today\u2019s VUCA world, there are a lot of grey situations. For instance, the present case, where organisations are struggling with cash flows, to maintain employee wellbeing and experience. At this time, their decision-making process and the way execution will exhibit their code of ethics.\n\nOrganisational reputation and brand\n\nAn organisation where employees uphold the highest standards of professionalism and ethics is seen as an employer of choice. But in reality, it is not awards and publications that make a person the best employer. Rather it is the way when you uphold your values in times of crisis and helps the organisation to get through it.\n\nProfitability and productivity\n\nEthics and organisational success go hand in hand. Value-driven companies are always successful in the long run, with a workforce that is committed, engaged, and capable. In today\u2019s crisis, organisations that will persevere, pivot, and innovate to meet the needs of a new normal and engage their employees while doing so will emerge as winners.\n\nBuilding of society\n\nOrganisations are a subunit of society. What we do at work, we carry back home and vice versa. As we abide by professional and ethical standards at work, we bring the same values of commitment, dedication, loyalty, and integrity to our family and society. For example- We visited a store in Delhi a few days back. The guard at the entrance told us to wait as only limited people were allowed inside. We decided to wait, but the lady behind us got impatient and tried to enter the store even though the guard had not given a go-ahead. Witnessing this, my twelve-year kid elucidated the lady about the rules and the importance of maintaining the distance. A little taken aback, she listened and decided to stay back for her safety.\n\nThese are just a few implications of imbibing professionalism and ethics in our day to day interactions, at work, and in our personal dealings. It is also evident, that maintaining a professional and ethical mindset, as individuals and organisations will be vital in emerging as conquerors in the corona crisis.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353631", "author": ["Sonica Aron"]}, {"title": "Millennials and Upskilling: The Changing Role of HR", "text": "July 22, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWith the advent of new technological disruptions in the form of artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, Internet-of-Things, blockchain and cloud, we\u2019re at the cusp of a dramatic shift in the industry. This disruption is likely to have an impact on the job market too. A recent McKinsey Global Institute report titled, Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automation, predicts that about 14 per cent of the global workforce or about 375 million workers will feel the need to switch their occupational categories by as early as 2030. To stay relevant in the changing industry scenario, they will need to equip themselves with new skills and find ways to completely redefine their career paths.\n\nWhile the McKinsey report presents the global picture, we\u2019re seeing this trend reflected in India as well. As per the Future of Jobs in India report by EY- Nasscom, by 2022 we can expect 9 per cent of the workforce will be deployed in new jobs that do not exist today. Also, 37 per cent of professionals will work in jobs that require radically different skill sets.\n\nIn order to ward off obsolescence, the workforce needs to learn new skills that will soon become mainstream. A World Economic Forum report predicts that almost 54 per cent of all employees will require significant reskilling and upskilling by 2022. Not just that, but about 35 per cent will likely require up to six months of additional training, and about 20 per cent are likely to require even more long-term training.\n\nMillennials in the Workforce\n\nThe other big trend we\u2019re seeing in the entry of millennials into the formal workforce. As India\u2019s huge population of millennials grows up and joins the workforce, we\u2019re starting to see their impact. As per a 2018 report by Deloitte India and the Retailers Association of India, millennials have emerged as the chief wage earners in India with a 47 per cent share in the working-age population. The millennial employees tend to behave differently compared with their predecessors. For instance, a survey by Censuswide revealed that 56 per cent of millennial respondents have job-hopped at least once in the last 16 months; and three times in the last 3-10 years. Interestingly, about 49 per cent of respondents saw job-hopping as an opportunity to learn new skills.\n\nRole of HR\n\nFor HR professionals, the message is clear. Creating the right framework and mechanisms for upskilling of the workforce, especially millennials, needs to be a priority.\n\nFor an organization to stay competitive and thrive in the dynamic new world, building the right skills within the organization is crucial. This requires a two-pronged approach of: first, upskilling existing millennials within the company and second, strategically hiring millennials who have the right skills.\n\nHowever, putting in place an effective learning and development strategy that can equip employees with the right skills isn\u2019t an easy task. An ad-hoc approach that asks employees to simply take a few online courses isn\u2019t the answer.\n\nGiven the pace of change, any rigid course structure that is long drawn and intensive is likely to become obsolete very soon. To be truly effective, course content development needs to take an agile approach, much like the software development process today where product roadmaps are dictated by user analytics.\n\nSuch an approach works particularly well for the millennial population since it puts greater control into the hands of the learner and allows them to adapt the programme such that it is aligned with their aspirations as well as the overall organisational objectives. Also, AI-driven analytics can help incorporate a high level of personalization and elements of gamification to ensure that learners are more motivated and engaged in the learning process.\n\nThe format of training matters too. For instance, a blended approach to learning that balances self-study with interactivity works better than an online-only approach. Our own experience shows that with a well-designed blended learning approach, NPS rates soar over 70 per cent; while course completion rates cross 50 per cent, which is four to five times the prevailing industry statistics.\n\nA \u2018Digital Readiness\u2019 survey conducted by Simplilearn in conjunction with People Matters magazine found that 87 per cent of organizations agreed that digital upskilling is a necessity; while 65 per cent acknowledged that they lacked resources and a vividly defined roadmap.\n\nBy all accounts, the fourth industrial revolution will favour those with strong digital skills. Given this, HR has a critical role to play in ensuring that they are placing an adequate focus on designing effective programsme that are designed to help millennials upskill themselves such that they are well-equipped to deliver value in the era of the fourth industrial revolution.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353630", "author": ["Kashyap Dalal"]}, {"title": "iPhone 12 Leaks: A Powerhorse That Will Leave You Excited", "text": "July 22, 2020 4 min read\n\nThe rumours of the iPhone 12 are making users pretty exciting about the launch.\n\nTo start with, it\u2019s being said that iPhone 12 will destroy the iPhone 11.

If this happens it will boost the battery life by 10-12 per cent.\n\nWhile we all have been excited about the price slash, now we also have a better idea of why Apple will be charging less. A piece of news that might disappoint many. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo revealed that Apple will not be including a fast 20W charger in the box with the iPhone 12.\n\nIt is being said that Apple's 20W power adapter will be an optional accessory and there are huge changes that the company will also end production of both 5W and 18W power adapters.\n\nThe latest leak brings in good news for camera lovers. While the iPhone 11 camera is already loved by people, iPhone 12 will have A14 chip, a powerhorse that could change the entire dynamics of pervious iPhones (iPhone 11 that comes with A13). This addition will boost the speed and battery life (despite it having a smaller battery than iPhone 11) both at the same time, something users would thoroughly enjoy.\n\nAs per PhoneArea, iPhone 11 has A13 chip that uses 7 nanometer (7nm) process, while A15 will use a 5-nanometer (5nm) process.

Having such a processor in a tiny device already makes it a power-piece all set to compete in the smartphone market.\n\nIf the leaks are true, the features will lead to a powerful photo processor, making it a great camera phone in the market as well.\n\niPhone 12 Series\n\nMoving on to the models iPhone 12 Max comes with a 6.1-inch screen and iPhone 12 Pro with 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR with ProMotion along with 6GB RAM. The Pro models will have 120Hz high refresh-rate displays and a bigger screen will only led to draining a lot more energy. However, a bigger battery across the iPhone 12 models could make it a winner.\n\nThe phone will be available in three internal storage variants of 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. The latest model will be combined with powerful chips in the form of the A14 Bionic.\n\nTalking about the price point, this model might be super cheap than expected. As per leaker Omega Leaks tweet, iPhone 12- 4G \u2014 might be priced at $549 and iPhone 12 Max 4G would be $649.\n\nNo Charger or EarPods\n\nWhile we all have been excited about the price slash, Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo revealed that Apple will not be including a fast 20W charger in the box with the iPhone 12.\n\nIt is being said that Apple's 20W power adapter will be an optional accessory and there are huge changes that the company will also end production of both 5W and 18W power adapters.\n\nAR- LiDar Scanner\n\nAnother great rumour - this monster chip will support the LiDAR scanner, which is already available in iPad Pro. This feature might be available in iPhone 12 Pro models. This move will certainly transform the gadgets AR capabilities.\n\nThe latest developments will make the iPhone 12 beat its predecessor in terms of looks, camera, speed, power, new chip, making it a powerful device that one would love to own.\n\nAlso Read:\n\niPhone 12 Leaks: It's Everything We Have Been Waiting For\n\niPhone 12 Leaks: Bad News for Apple Consumers", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353625", "author": ["Priyadarshini Patwa"]}, {"title": "Battery Swapping-Is It a Success In India?", "text": "July 21, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nAs we set out towards a \u2018greener environment\u2019, the emergence of electrically powered vehicles are more evident than ever before.

Thus, to build India's electric car industry, the government will also have to recognize \u2018battery swapping\u2019 as a viable alternative to a vehicle's direct charging.\n\nA recent report suggests that India's EV battery swapping market is projected to reach $6.1 million by 2030, registering 31.3 per cent growth during 2020-2030.\n\nThe need for private vehicles will increase given the new normal, where maintaining social distancing may be a norm. The need for more lightweight, yet sturdy structures running on superior quality tires will continue the pace because driven by consumer demand, the industry will push EV two-wheelers, cars in their view to make a sustainable mode of commuting, and because the companies still deploy electric fleet.\n\nTwo and three-wheelers dominate the Indian auto market, and over 80 per cent of total vehicles in India comprise two-wheelers. Battery swapping technology may witness a faster adoption in the electric two-wheeler and three-wheeler mobility segment. In this segment (small vehicle), battery swapping technology presents a leapfrogging opportunity for India's EV dreams as it offers cost-effectiveness for consumers and several comparative advantages over dedicated charging infrastructure and fossil-fuel practices in the ease of use.\n\nThe key here is to form the transition more accessible for users by finding a replacement for the prevailing petrol pump. While the industry is watching charging stations, battery swapping should is an alternate and promising charging option for two-wheelers and three-wheelers. Many manufacturers have begun with a singular solution. They're in the process of making an ecosystem of swappable battery stations in association with service providers.\n\nBenefits of Battery Swapping\n\nFirst, swapping a battery takes only a couple of minutes, which eliminates drivers' wait time. Conventional fast and slow charging could take anywhere from 2-6 hours, respectively, for a fully charged vehicle. Taking cues from somewhat of an in-depth cousin of EVs, the CNG vehicles where refueling takes a minimum of 10-20 minutes waiting in line, EV charging experience would be ten times as inconvenient and equally undesirable. This time is precious, especially for a commercial vehicle driver. Thus, a 90-second battery swap makes excellent sense in keeping the car ready-to-use without wasting time. It will also reduce the dimensions of batteries in vehicles and offer an increased available run time.\n\nSecond, within the entire EV value chain, charging infrastructure is a vital enabler. Based on surveys by think tanks, the limited availability of charging infrastructure, including a scarcity of adequate business and financing models, is considered one of the most critical obstacles to widespread EV adoption by customers who suffer from range anxiety.\n\nFinally, the high upfront cost of EVs is due to the high price of the battery pack, which constitutes 40-60 per cent of the value of an EV. In the case of battery swapping, the battery packs are often separated from the vehicle and owned by energy operators. Therefore the end-user will only need to pay whenever they swap the used battery with a charged one instantly.\n\nSubsidizing the battery cost will help promote faster adoption of EVs in India. By offering financial incentives for manufacturing batteries as against the entire EV, the manufacturing of batteries too would get accelerated; technology and innovation would flourish; economies of scale would be achieved, and batteries would be both domestically produced and affordable. Battery swapping technology will tackle the challenge of the lack of common battery standards across multiple automakers and significantly lower upfront costs for two and three-wheelers in the long-run.\n\nWith the above benefits taken into consideration, the possibilities for mass-scale swappable EV battery packs are endless. The battery swapping infrastructure doesn't need any investment from the local power distribution companies and can also rely on a low current carrying capacity.\n\nWith the rapid adoption of EVs in India, there will be a need for constant innovation in the electric car industry to accommodate consumer demand. The EV market is bound to catalyze new business models, including battery swapping technology and battery charging, paving the way for economic growth and job creation.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353581", "author": ["Akhil Aryan"]}, {"title": "World Has Evolved for Young Entrepreneurs Due To the Power of Internet: Kavin Bharti Mittal", "text": "July 21, 2020 3 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nDespite coming from a family which owns one of the largest businesses in India, Kavin Bharti Mittal decided to start his own venture.

In an interaction with Entrepreneur India, Mittal talks about the blend of virtual reality and social networking, and how the future of social media seems totally different than it was perceived earlier.\n\nThe Journey\n\nAccording to him, the world has evolved immensely in the last couple of decades for younger entrepreneurs due to the power of Internet and people undervalue the power of Internet where all the information is available in the form of research papers, blogs, books, journals, etc. for free.\n\n\u201cBuilding a company is not complicated but it\u2019s tough. When we built Hike, out five-point focus was vision, principles, people, product and process.\u201d\n\nHe believes principles are essential as they act as a significant part of cultural code to hire people who align to business values. A little bit of processes is added to all the above points to streamline the framework. \u201cThis framework was designed by me 2-4 years ago which served the best outcome. This is how we marked our presence and the life has become much easier.\u201d\n\nPandemic and launching HikeLand\n\nTechnology has enabled people to do things which people were unable to do before. And the current situation of COVID has led to the use of more social media platforms for interacting with their friends and family virtually. And this has benefited Hike in terms of traffic.\n\n\u201cWe reflected over the thought why do all social media platforms look the same as they were a decade ago. Considering feeds or messaging for 2G, the world has moved on, so, why hasn\u2019t the world gotten up? The interesting data point was that the peak time of Hike\u2019s usage was 10 PM to 12: 30 AM. And the only reason for that was offline hangout was difficult for them at that time. This is how HikeLand was introduced to fill the gap of the industry by creating the virtual world.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic has been a learning phase for many including Mittal. He said two-three years ago, the usage of the hike was completely different as compared in this period of two-three months. Hike started with digital avatar and now Facebook does even have a similar kind of thing, he added.\n\nHike emphasises \u201cgreat relationships make happy people\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur target audience are from 16-22 where the young generation can build a new network similarly they do when they are offline.\u201d\n\nMonetization Strategy\n\nFor Mittal, micro transactions are going to be the biggest achievement for the future growth of the virtual platform.\n\nUPI transactions in India have transformed the outlook of people. \u201cIn our realm, relationships make people happier and we are proud to pioneer this business model. Revenue for us was a notable pixel as we experiment with building new features.\u201d\n\nThoughts on Gaming\n\n\u201cYes, absolutely! People love to pay for games as compared to investing on a content app.\u201d\n\nHike recently acquired WinZo. \u201cWe consistently check tractions on WinZo.

The biggest chunk of that came in March from the Cares Act, a $2 trillion relief package designed to pump cash into every part of the American economy.\n\nFor individuals, it had two pillars \u2014 a wave of one-time checks of up to $1,200, and a $600 federal boost to weekly unemployment payouts \u2014 to help shore up their finances during an economic collapse. But those stimulus payments are largely spent and the government unemployment payout expires within five days for all 50 states.\n\nNow, Congress is looking at five measures that could provide financial relief and put extra cash in people's bank accounts, including additional stimulus checks for Americans. Here are the details.\n\nLawmakers are weighing another round of stimulus checks\n\nImage credit: Jeff Fusco/Stringer\n\nTrump has expressed support for sending another wave of $1,200 stimulus checks, The Washington Post reported on June 23. However, White House advisers and Republican lawmakers are deeply divided.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin opened the door to a second round of stimulus checks in June and backs the move. Still, other top administration officials argue the measure should be targeted.\n\nLarry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, has said the administration might push to send checks only to \"people who lost their jobs and are most in need.\"\n\nThere are still significant rifts among congressional Republicans as well. Many say they don't believe its needed to boost the economy, but some lawmakers say they're open to the idea if its aimed towards low-income people.\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell opened the door earlier this month for another stimulus check for Americans earning below $40,000 a year. That step, however, could leave out 20 million people.\n\nA bill from Sen. Marco Rubio introduced last month would give mixed-status families with unauthorized immigrants $1,200 stimulus checks.\n\nUnder the Cares Act, individuals earning under $75,000 a year ($150,000 for couples) got checks of $1,200, plus an extra $500 for dependent children. Payments phased out at $99,000 for single filers and $198,000 for couples.\n\nBy the beginning of June, over 159 million Americans had received direct payments, per the IRS.\n\nAn extension of boosted unemployment payments is also under consideration\n\nImage credit: Reuters\n\nDemocrats are seeking to extend the $600 federal boost to weekly unemployment benefits \u2014 set to expire on July 25 for 49 states and July 26 for New York \u2014 through January.\n\nBut many Republicans have argued that the boost should be phased out or the amount lowered so workers don't find it more lucrative to earn from the government than a job.\n\nThe White House is signaling it could extend the payments at a lower amount, such as $200 and $400 a week, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that five out of every six recipients would get more money from the government than from their previous employer if the supplement were extended through the end of the year.\n\nUnemployment, though, is expected to remain in or near double digits for much of the year, according to the CBO and the Federal Reserve.\n\nA group of top bipartisan economists recently called on Congress to implement a federal boost of up to $400 per week past July, tied to the economic health of individual states.\n\nLawmakers are proposing hazard pay to give essential workers a financial boost\n\nImage credit: Jeffrey Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nIn the HEROES Act passed in May, House Democrats included $200 billion in hazard pay for essential workers such as grocery store employees. That measure would supplement an extra $13 an hour on top of regular wages for those workers.\n\nSenate Democrats also released a proposal \u2014 known as the \"Heroes Fund\" \u2014 to provide up to $25,000 per person for a broad range of essential workers, including delivery drivers.\n\nSome congressional Republicans moved in that direction too. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah also unveiled a plan to provide additional money for essential workers. It would ramp up pay for qualifying workers earning less than $50,000 a year by $12 an hour for three months.\n\nRepublicans are pushing for a \"back to work\" bonus of up to $1,200\n\nImage credit: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nSeveral Republicans have rolled out proposals for a hiring bonus, arguing that it would be effective in getting people off unemployment rolls and back to work.\n\nRep. Kevin Brady introduced a plan for a $1,200 bonus, which is equivalent to a jobless person collecting two weeks of expanded unemployment benefits.\n\nAnother bill from Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio would put the bonus at $450 a week for up to six weeks.\n\n\"The $600 was necessary, in my view, to get us started in this, but now we have a situation where the economy is starting to reopen, people are looking for workers,\" Portman said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing earlier this month.\n\nTrump has repeatedly advocated for a payroll tax cut, which would reduce taxes paid by workers and possibly employers depending on its design\n\nImage credit: EUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nTrump called for a payroll tax cut back in March as the economy cratered due to the pandemic. In recent days, the president doubled down on the measure and indicated he may not sign a package that doesn't contain it.\n\n\"It's been proven to be successful and it's a big saving for the people\" Trump said on Monday, calling the tax break \"very important\" to him.\n\nPayroll taxes are the 7.65% of earnings taken out of employee paychecks and another 7.65% that's levied on employers to finance the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The idea is that trimming or doing away with the tax for workers would put more money into their paychecks.\n\nBut congressional Republicans have expressed skepticism on its ability to boost the economy, suggesting that it may not make it into the final spending package negotiated with Democrats who oppose it.\n\n\"I think when a person has a check in his hand...

So, if you can build the audience on your own, you\u2019ll have plenty of evidence that you have a skill set or talent in your dream career and that you\u2019re an asset that employers should want.\n\nRelated: The 9-Step Quick Guide to Rehabbing Your Career\n\nThis is in accordance with one of my favorite quotes: \u201cBe so good they can\u2019t ignore you.\u201d Jessie James Decker, country music singer and fashion designer, shared with Lori Greiner on the \u201cBed Talks with Lori\u201d Live series that the first thing you should do if you're a singer is to post videos of yourself singing. If you\u2019re good, people will pay attention, follow you and share your page with others. We so often think that we first need to be \u201cgiven the microphone\u201d or the platform to show what we can do, but it begins with taking the initiative on our own and believing in our talents enough to trust that sharing them will get us somewhere.\n\nBuild your audience backwards\n\nIt's easy to say \"just get started,\" but it\u2019s also key to be strategic with our efforts. Sunny Lenarduzzi is a social media marketing expert who has almost half a million subscribers. When I asked her for her best advice on building an audience for your dream career, she said to work backwards. \u201cThe most successful channels and clients I've worked with know exactly who they are speaking to and exactly what they're trying to achieve before they ever record a single video. I emphasize that you need to research before you record,\u201d she told me.\n\n\u201cLook at mentors and influencers who have the exact audience you are looking to attract, and study what pieces of content are getting the most engagement from their audience. That will help inform the kind of content you create,\u201d she says.\n\nRelated: How to Turn Your Passion Into Your Dream Job\n\nEssentially, it comes down to knowing what it is you want to say or do, then identifying the audience that most wants to hear it or engage with it. Then, don\u2019t stray from that message or that type of content as you begin to build your audience. I experienced explosive growth on my TikTok channel (quadrupling my following from 10,000 to over 40,000 in just over a month) once I focused solely on my niche, which is \u201ccreating your dream life.\u201d By building my audience backwards, my efforts were more fruitful.\n\nIt\u2019s admittedly daunting to go after your dream career and show up to an (initially) small audience day after day. But ultimately, if it\u2019s truly your dream career, you\u2019ll want to do the heart of the work even if no one sees or hears it. In today\u2019s social media-oriented world, we have the power to make the most of our platforms rather than waiting to be discovered. If you take it seriously and create consistently, your dream career awaits.\n\nRelated: What Are Loop Giveaways and How Can You Use Them to Gain Millions of Followers?", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/352945", "author": ["Haley Hoffman Smith"]}, {"title": "Starting a Digital Business? Here Are Common Pitfalls to Avoid", "text": "July 10, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nStarting an online business requires some planning. An entrepreneur needs to gauge demand, understand how SEO and digital ads work and know how to acquire customers cost-efficiently. If the formula works, the business can scale rapidly. As stated in the \u201cEnabling Digital Entrepreneurs\u201d report by World Bank Group, \u201cmany digital entrepreneurs are \u2018born global\u2019 and have the ability to grow and scale across borders very quickly.\u201d\n\nOnline spending has skyrocketed in recent years, and continued growth is likely as people continue to stay home, which \"creates huge opportunities for internet stores,\u201d says Mathieu Jang in an interview. He\u2019s the co-founder of Affiliate Institute, a Las Vegas-based training firm that helps members grow revenue online.\n\nJang created a 12-week accelerator program that optimizes students\u2019 affiliate-marketing practices. Aside from the technical aspects of ecommerce, he says it\u2019s critical to have the proper mindset and remove notions of a personal limitation: \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t happen to successful marketers. Top performers happen to the world.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., ecommerce now represents 16 percent of all retail sales, according to the Commerce Department. And Amazon.com accounts for more than one-third of ecommerce. Thus, a small business can potentially reach a massive audience. However, there are pitfalls to avoid.\n\nRelated: 3 Things You Need to Know Before Starting a Delivery Service Business\n\n1. Not understanding your target customer\n\nYou can burn plenty of cash by running ineffective ads. Bad marketing campaigns increase the cost of acquiring a customer, which is a crucial metric for a digital venture. There\u2019s much noise on social and the web, which can confuse how novices approach campaigns. You need to truly understand the target audience in order to optimize ads. That means being effective with location, interests, design, calls to action and other factors that increase conversions and lower customer-acquisition costs.\n\nThe sales volume for merchandise is huge. For example, the online market for apparel, footwear and accessories will hit $4 trillion this year. Shopping on the web has also increased demand for online services like SEO, website building, graphic design and advertising. A high level of understanding means you\u2019ve properly identified a niche. By knowing who\u2019ll buy and who won\u2019t, you can optimize a website\u2019s content based on that niche, putting you in a better position to create the appropriate landing pages, newsletters, brochures and social posts to attract relevant traffic. When you publish better content, you\u2019ll improve inbound marketing metrics, as well as increase user engagement.\n\nOwners of physical storefronts had it easier because a target consumer was often someone who lived nearby or an adjacent town, but online obviously has no geographic boundaries. It helps to create a digital persona of who you\u2019re targeting. What does your ideal shopper look and behave like? What style of clothing or shoes are they seeking? Which features matter most? You may be able to find profiling tools on social platforms that help to create target profiles. A business owner cannot successfully carve out a niche without identifying their customers.\n\n2. Working as a lone wolf\n\nIt helps greatly to already possess knowledge of online practices like SEO, ads, ecommerce, email campaigns and social media best practices, but there can be frustrating blind spots. You may be good at running Facebook ads but flounder at writing landing pages. Or you may have high open rates on email campaigns but suffer low purchase conversions. Scott Smith, the founder of 7 Figure Surfer, said in a recent phone call, \u201cDuring my six years working online, I often had to figure it out myself. I started from scratch and spent thousands of dollars in the process.\u201d\n\nSmith overcame these hurdles by getting a few mentors who showed solutions, as well as provided encouragement. A seasoned veteran can quickly teach entrepreneurs what works and what doesn\u2019t, saving them headaches, time and money. It\u2019s a good idea to attend conferences, meet-ups and networking events to exchange contact info with gurus. Leveraging other people\u2019s expertise (in areas where you are weak) boosts the efficacy of campaigns. When setting up an ecommerce venture, small tweaks can pay big dividends.\n\n3. Not outsourcing or using automation tools\n\nOutsourcing enables business owners to cost-effectively tap the skills of independent contractors, streamlining the business because they\u2019re better at specific tasks than you are. Virtual assistants free up time so you can focus on acquiring customers and providing after-purchase support. Hiring a video producer to create a popular TikTok video is a more effective use of time and budget than doing it yourself.\n\nOr use a tool that\u2019s saving business owners time. Neuro.net, the automation tool, acts as the outsourced call center for retail customers to get support from virtual agents in even complex conversations. And according to the company, it simulates human emotions so well that 99 percent of people don\u2019t know they\u2019re talking to a robot agent. Now that\u2019s a bold claim for an automation tool, but data-processing company Powerry clearly believes it, given their recent $5.3 million dollar investment in Neuro.net. Nevertheless, it\u2019s an affordable option for business owners who can\u2019t quite afford full-time customer-support agents at their current growth stage.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely important that business owners spend their limited time on activities that are crucial for success. Non-essential tasks should be delegated to others. An online business can reach global audiences and scale rapidly. Know your target audience, network with experts in a similar niche and build a team infrastructure that can scale your venture.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/352655", "author": ["Sarah Austin"]}, {"title": "4 Principles to Sell Your Business From Steve Little, the Mergers and Acquisitions Master Who Always Gets More", "text": "July 21, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIf you own a business that produces between $5 million and $100 million every year, what is your business worth? What\u2019s your exit strategy, and how much money do you want to walk away with? What\u2019s your ultimate dream come true? What do you want to do once you buy all the toys you\u2019ve ever wanted (the cars, the beach house, the exotic trips, and so on)?\n\nWhat kind of impact do you want to have?\n\nAccording to Pitchbook, in 2019, 11,304 business sales were made valued at over $2 trillion in North America, and approximately 64% of those deals were under $100 million.\n\nGlobally, the IMAA Institute tracked 48,849 deals valued at $3.8 trillion USD in 2019. (For context, that\u2019s more the GDP of India, the fifth-largest economy in the world.)\n\nI recently interviewed Steve Little, a unique mergers and acquisitions expert who\u2019s done over 400 deals over his 40-year career and is known by his clients for \u201calways getting more.\u201d You might recognize him from transactions he\u2019s completed with IBM, Seagate or Redfly, or from speaking engagements with business leaders at EO, Cadre or MMT.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips to Successfully Sell Your Company\n\nHe started his technology career working directly with Jack Welch at GE as an operating systems performance modeling specialist. That\u2019s a fancy way of saying a mathematician who simulated operating systems to increase productivity and profit.\n\nNow he uses that superpower to increase the value of the businesses he sells. One of Little\u2019s big principles is \u201cBusinesses are sold, not bought.\u201d What does that mean exactly, and why is it so important to you and your business?\n\nThe best way to illustrate this principle is with a story:\n\n\"Before he died, a father said to his son; \u201cHere is a watch that your grandfather gave me. It is almost 200 years old. Before I give it to you, go to the jewelry store downtown. Tell them that I want to sell it, and see how much they offer you.\"\n\nThe son went to the jewelry store, came back to his father, and said, \"They offered me $150 because it's so old.\"\n\nThe father said, \u201cGo to the pawnshop and ask them.\"\n\nThe son went to the pawnshop, came back to his father, and said, \"The pawnshop offered $10 because it looks so worn.\"\n\nThe father asked his son to go to the museum and show them the watch.\n\nHe went to the museum, came back, and said to his father, \u201cThe curator offered $500,000 for this very rare piece to be included in their precious antique collections.\"\n\nRelated: Keep These 4 Things in Mind Before Selling Your Small Business\n\nThe father said, \u201cI wanted to let you know that the right place values you in the right way. Don't find yourself in the wrong place and get angry if you are not valued. Those that know your value are those who appreciate you. Don't stay in a place where nobody sees your value.\"\n\nKnow your worth.\n\nThe moral of the story is that the right people will value you for who you are and what you have. Don't spend time with people who don't value you. Find the ones that do.\n\nOne of the reasons Little\u2019s past clients consistently say that he\u2019s \u201cthe guy who gets more\u201d is because of his industry longevity. He has a massive Rolodex and system that consistently produces results, informed by a list of 24 Value Drivers and four Key Principles.\n\nThe Value Drivers are critical areas of focus Little uses to increase the value of a business in 6-18 months. The Four Key Principles are disciplined rules and mindsets every business owner needs to consistently produce predictable results that lead to a business sale.\n\nPrinciple One\n\nThere's always a risk-value equation. The higher the risk of ownership, the lower the value of the company; the lower the risk of ownership, the higher the value of the company. Anything you do that reduces risk increases value.\n\nPrinciple Two\n\nValuation does not equal transaction value. All business owners are operating on the understanding that a valuation represents the actual value of their business. It's not -- and it's essential to understand the difference between your business\u2019 valuation and the transaction value of your company. The transaction value is what the right buyer will pay for the business at the right time. If it were just revenue and earnings, you couldn't explain companies like Snapchat, Twitter, and so many other startups with limited or no revenue and earnings that are worth billions.\n\nRelated: 3 Tips to Speed Up Selling Your Business\n\nPrinciple Three\n\nBusinesses are sold, not bought. For every business, at any time, there are multiple potential buyers. Each buyer will value your business uniquely. It's usually based on a factor that's related to how much more valuable their business will be after acquiring your business. It's important to understand what they value most so that you're positioned properly, as the watch story reinforces.\n\nPrinciple Four\n\nThe exit strategy is not about the exit, it\u2019s about the strategy. You can't possibly know what your business is worth or where you're going to invest your time and money to make it worth more if you don't know who would buy you, why they would buy you, and what they value most.\n\nThese Four Principles are guiding concepts for you to build a business of great value.\n\nLittle adds that at the end of the day, is just like selling anything else. It really comes down to something quite simple: people talking to people.\n\nWhen he gets started with a new client, he wants to understand the person: their aspirations, what they want to accomplish in life, their intentions, their goals, and their objectives. What\u2019s going to make them happy? He then works to design a strategy or plan that delivers that to them. After his initial evaluation, Little comes back with a series of strategies that can be applied to elevate the value of the business and get the most money in the shortest period of time while also creating a legendary impact.\n\nTo learn more about selling your business for more, working with Steve Little and the Value Driver Video and \u201cValuation Growth Playbook\u201d that explain Little\u2019s \u201c24 Value Drivers\u201d mentioned in the interview, visit www.ZeroLimitsVentures.com/Free\n\nWatch the whole video interview here: www.MrBz.com/SteveLittleSite", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353280", "author": ["Mike Koenigs"]}, {"title": "This $11 Virtual Copywriting Course Is an Easy Way for Entrepreneurs to Create Great Content Without Spending a Fortune", "text": "July 21, 2020 2 min read\n\nDisclosure: Our goal is to feature products and services that we think you'll find interesting and useful.

Adding digital components like a website, mobile app or electronic payment processing didn't necessarily mean you'd undergone a complete digital transformation.\n\nThe current health crisis has changed the business community with guidelines and mandates on remote work and social distancing. Even if you\u2019re fortunate enough to continue operating, this radical change may mean it\u2019s time to take a deep dive into a digital transformation, rather than just baby steps.\n\nHere's why you need to change now, and how to do so on a lean budget.\n\nRelated: How to Reward Employees in Uncertain Times\n\nCrumbling legacy systems and paper processes\n\nNot every business is adequately handling the volume that many financial institutions and state and federal organizations are currently experiencing for loan and unemployment processing. These are prime examples of the insufficiencies of legacy systems buckling under the pressure of increased demand. Healthcare and insurance systems are also struggling in this new environment.\n\nAccounting\n\nOn a smaller scale, businesses and startups are also finding it difficult to continue using manual accounting systems that involve paper processes. For example, the new environment makes it difficult to process paper paychecks unless an employee can remotely access the payroll and accounting software as well as print checks. They must also mail all those checks and hope that their employees can somehow deposit them all while complying with shelter-in-place rules.\n\nPayments\n\nPerhaps your business can stay open but you primarily dealt in cash, in-store credit or debit card payments. It\u2019s difficult to continue serving customers without migrating to a digital ordering and payment process. While you might be able to incorporate curbside pickups, customers may not accept this option. If so, they\u2019ll go to a different business that lets them use an order and payment app.\n\nAdding more digital solutions can help sustain your business during these uncertain times as well as maintain revenue and keep productive work flowing.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways to Determine If Now Is the Right Time to Launch Your Business\n\nDiscounted and free digital solutions\n\nCost may have been a factor in your earlier decision to delay a digital transformation. However, many companies see the current health crisis as an opportunity to help out potential customers and simultaneously attract a wider audience for their digital solutions. Many companies are offering their digital tools, apps and platforms for free or at a vastly reduced price.\n\nThere\u2019s a digital solution for every size and type of business, and these potential solutions are worth considering now. For example, companies like 1Password, which make it easy to store passwords digitally, are providing six months of access for free. Cisco Webex, which provides video conferencing capability for webinars and meetings, will extend a 90-day license to businesses whether or not they\u2019re current customers. And many LogMeIn products are available for free to companies for three months through Emergency Remote Work Kits.\n\nAvailable products cover everything from collaboration and communication to HR and financial software tools, in addition to security and remote access solutions. You\u2019ll find numerous lists published online to help you assess your options.\n\nTesting capability\n\nBack when it was business as usual, you might have hesitated to implement new tools in case something went wrong or downtime diminished your customer experience. During the health crisis, however, you can grab this opportunity to test various digital tools and take the digital plunge.\n\nRelated: What You Can Learn From Freelancers Right Now\n\nMany tools and platforms offer trial periods so that you can assess their solutions.

Now, however, these digital tools are becoming essential parts of daily life. It\u2019s a great time to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, and to get feedback from customers and employees about what works well for them.

The dairy industry was no different. Even after the government's clarification that lockdown will have no impact on essential services, in the initial days, the dairy tech players did struggle to operate.\n\n\u201cWe deploy a lot of hardware across the supply chain. So we had to send our teams on the ground to check these devices. However, in the initial few days, our teams took some time to reach the ground as police did not let them pass,\" said Ranjith Mukundan, co-founder and CEO, Stellapps Technologies.\n\nHowever, with time, and intervention of authorities, police complied and the on-ground team reached the site of work.\n\n\"We were among a few companies that had a 100 per cent fulfilment rate throughout the lockdown,\" added Chakradhar Gade, co-founder, Country Delight. He said right from the time lockdown was announced, the entire team of Country Delight started 'over-communicating' with each stakeholder present in the supply chain.\n\n\"When you communicate, you understand what the broad concerns for each of these stakeholders are,\" he added.\n\nApart from changing delivery slots, the company reached out to local police stations and built a backup production facility not to hamper the production.\n\nIn the following months, Country Delight doubled down on its takeaway centres as it split their distribution centres and installed Bluetooth devices to track distance between people at their centres.\n\nLargest Producer But Low Consumption Rate?\n\nOver the years, India has managed to produce sufficient milk to cater to 1.3 billion people. However, the consumption per capita of milk in the country hovers around 400 gm per day, despite being the largest milk producer. Experts believe the main reason behind a low consumption per capita is the lack of popularity of value-added products such as cheese, paneer, yoghurt, among others. In western countries, consumption per capita of milk range in kilograms as 81 per cent of the milk products are eaten, whereas in India 65 per cent prefer drinking milk.\n\nAccording to Gade of Country Delight, value-added products are not 'truly Indian' in nature and doesn't fit the lifestyle of Indian consumers.\n\nGade said even people living in cities prefer fresh and unadulterated milk to consume directly compared with value-added products as people know that milk is a perishable product.\n\nApart from this, Gade said Indian milk brands are imitating western companies while producing value-added products. Taking an example of ultra-high temperature milk (UHT) and yoghurt brands, Gade noted that they only comprise four to five per cent of the market. \"Bulk of the Indian consumers prefer products like Misti doi, or Rabdi (Indian sweet). So brands need to research to understand consumer preference before launching a new product,\" he added.\n\nExplaining further he said people generally mix turmeric, ginger or badam in milk while consuming at home.\n\nOpportunities In the Dairy Sector\n\nThough there was a 30 per cent drop in milk consumption in the initial months of lockdown according to a CARE rating report, a significant surge in household consumption and spur in premium milk product for quality packaging has cushioned the consumption fall.\n\nCurrently, India produces 572 trillion litres of milk from 300 million cattle every day. This comprises 4.1 per cent of the country's GDP. According to Mukundan, of the 572 million litres, 143 million litres of milk, i.e., 25 per cent, is sourced to the organized sector, 42 per cent is consumed locally whereas 33 per cent is sold at local mom and pop shops.\n\n\"Organized sector is growing at 20 per cent per year, and the dairy industry as a whole is growing at 6 per cent per year. There is a large room for growth as India still comprise 75 per cent of the unorganized sector,\" added Mukundan.\n\n\"India has a huge addressable market, and till now there has been only a handful of players trying to disrupt the market,\" said Ishpreet Singh Gandhi, founder and managing partner of Stride Ventures.\n\nAccording to him, India can be a pioneer in terms of deriving technology-based solutions. \"There are state-to-state hurdles present in this country. If a player can look into this problem and serve products to consumers in different states, then I believe the particular solution can be used internationally as well,\" added Gandhi.\n\nFrom an investor's perspective, Gandhi believes that milk is an underlying commodity, which has not seen disruption despite multiple lockdowns. \"That's one factor which excites people supporting these companies despite their limited runways,\" added Gandhi.\n\nDuring this tough time, a lot of startups opted for collaboration to stay afloat. Gade believes cross-sector collaboration has been benefiting both parties during these tough times. According to him, dairy tech players can collaborate with edutech or medicine, delivering startups to target similar types of customers and grow faster.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/video/353244", "author": ["Debarghya Sil"]}, {"title": "3 Ways Customer Relationships Will Change Forever In Light Of COVID-19", "text": "July 15, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nUndoubtedly, COVID-19 has rocked the economy. The International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) World Economic Outlook predicts the cumulative loss to the world\u2019s GDP from 2020 to 2021 will be approximately $9 trillion. That\u2019s more than the combined economies of Germany and Japan.\n\nBut the crisis has disrupted more than global markets; it has changed peoples\u2019 lives, needs, priorities and spending behaviors. Approximately 40 per cent of Australians are feeling financially insecure, and as a result, professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts that household consumption will decline by $37.9 billion within the next year.\n\nIn harsh economic conditions, consumers become more discerning with where and how they spend their money\u2014for businesses, this creates a new set of challenges.\n\nCustomer-centricity is a term that has been used since the 1960s, but it has never been more relevant than in today\u2019s business landscape. In such extreme environments, customers want more than the best offering or the lowest price; they seek dependability, confidence and trust in the brands they choose to do business with.\n\nThe end goal for a customer-centric business is customer loyalty. A dedicated customer base is key to surviving disruption, as they will continue to depend on your services even in challenging climates. But true customer-centricity is no set-and-forget solution. Retaining loyalty is about adapting your offering depending on the changing needs of your customers, and in some instances, knowing what they want before they do. This is where the modern reality of customer-centricity starts to connect operations with experiences, creating new dimensions of customer excellence.\n\nSo how are businesses expected to predict or adjust to evolving customer expectations? It begins with understanding how your company operates and what you need to change to keep your loyal customer base as close as possible.\n\nHere are three ways businesses can adapt to changing customer relationships, in light of COVID-19.\n\nLet growth goals take a backseat\n\nIf growing your customer base is a priority for your business right now, take a moment to reflect on the long-term cost of that growth, both reputation-wise and financially, to determine whether it is a sustainable pathway.\n\nFew businesses have been left untouched, if not unscathed, by COVID-19. Consequently, many companies have been forced to refocus their priorities, resources and goals to survive the crisis. If your business has not considered the immediate or future economic impact of the pandemic and how it could affect your organization, you need to start doing so now.\n\nPart of evaluating this impact is looking at factors you can control, or at the very least maintain, to ensure you keep as close to \u2018business as usual\u2019 as possible. A central element of your survival strategy is maintaining your existing customer base.\n\nFocusing on customer acquisition to the detriment of your existing ones can create a funnel effect, whereby a stream of new business comes in, while just as many customers go elsewhere. This can force companies into a spiral of deeper and deeper discounts to attract new consumers to their pool, which eventually runs dry along with their revenue streams.\n\nResearch by Forrester shows that new customers can cost five times more to convert than existing customers, indicating that it is much easier to expand and build-on existing loyalty than it is to tap into new client bases, especially during tough times.\n\nDo not fear missing out on opportunities for growth; rather, consider this crisis a chance to cement the fundamental processes and market share that make your business scalable.\n\nAlways remember; there is no point investing in your business\u2019 continuity if you have no customers on the other side.\n\nFocus on operational excellence, but keep it customer-centric\n\nHistorically, a continuous improvement mindset revolved around things such as standardized costs, stable operations and meeting compliance expectations. While these are all critical elements of running a business, somewhere along the way, these companies lost their grip on the bigger picture and realized their product was no longer relevant to the customer.\n\nOperational excellence is important, but carrying out a process 10 per cent better than the previous year does not matter if you miss the mark with your customer base.\n\nMore recently, businesses have started tapping into a different mindset that sees the customer experience translated throughout an end-to-end process. For truly customer-centric organizations, every decision and ambition has a customer-focused outcome in mind, be that improved experience or lasting sentiment.\n\nContinuous improvement no longer exists in an echo-chamber; the convergence of process excellence and customer experience is the new north star, and this mindset is embedded into the very structure of a business and its team.\n\nData-driven for precision\n\nIn a post-pandemic era, digital marketing and social communication channels are the name of the game, and when used correctly, can offer more specific insights into your customers\u2019 behaviors.\n\nUtilizing customer data can be as simple as surveying your existing customer base to gain actionable insights. The more data you have, the more accurate these insights will be.\n\nConsider every digital touchpoint of your customers\u2019 experiences as though they are leaving behind a fingerprint, containing a goldmine of DNA or data that helps you better understand their needs, expectations and concerns.\n\nTo develop a comprehensive customer excellence picture, it helps to combine each touchpoint into what is known as journey maps; a high-level, intuitively readable diagram that enables you to view the user experience from an outside-in perspective\u2014across all your personas. The journey visualization will increasingly identify areas for persona-centric process improvement, while empowering business mapping, change, and operational transformation.\n\nKeeping your finger on the customers\u2019 pulse means you are on the front foot when it comes to evolving patterns of behavior. Immediate access to data-driven insights allow you to adapt your processes and keep customers\u2019 satisfied, even in rapidly changing environments, boosting loyalty and retention rates.\n\nUsing these adaptations, businesses can come out of this crisis with the right fundamentals in place\u2014rather than a set of lowest common denominators that damage your brand in the long term.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353314", "author": ["Dr. Gero Decker"]}, {"title": "Being a Rainmaker During COVID-19", "text": "April 22, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nOver the last few weeks, we have seen\u2014and will continue to see\u2014survival of the fittest. At Monk\u2019s Hill Ventures, we\u2019ve started bucketing companies into three categories.\n\nThe first is the ice bucket\u2014any business that should essentially be put on ice during coronavirus. The chances of revenue for some businesses are almost zero this time compared with previous crises given worldwide downturns. Many of these businesses are related to travel or events.\n\nThe second category is pivot businesses, i.e. businesses where current customers are no longer buying and the business either needs to pivot to a new customer base or a new product altogether. Sometimes this could be just focusing more on a certain segment of existing prospects and customers (this is easier), sometimes it is creating a new channel (this is much harder during the crisis).\n\nAnd finally, the third category is the winners\u2014businesses that are thriving in this climate such as healthcare tech, collaborative tech, online grocery shopping and e-commerce.\n\nOne thing that is now becoming very clear, particularly for founders in bucket two and three, is that it is now time to strap on your boots and become a great rainmaker. The reason is this\u2014any sales engine you build today may cease to be viable in the next 3-12 months. What is true today might not be true in 12 months. Refocus your efforts on being a great rainmaker and build your base, not just in customers, but also your talent, your product, marketing and sales, finance, legal and human resources.\n\nA simple, but strategic question, these founders need to ask themselves is what happens when life returns to normal and all of this is over? How do you build good habits when the world comes back to normalcy?\n\nFor companies in bucket three who just addressed the onslaught of demand or MAU, here are a few considerations:\n\nOn runway: Runway is survival. That\u2019s why bucket 1 companies should go on ice. We have seen too many startups (even in normal times) that have to shut down because they made the most rosey or hopeful assumptions. Now is not the time to plan on the most optimistic scenarios. When you don\u2019t know what to expect, runway is the single most important determinant of survival. Cut your burn so you can survive longer.\n\nOn talent: Don\u2019t be cheap. Find the best people for your team now, whether it is another rainmaker, a CFO or a CMO. This is also your opportunity to see who among your team is cool under fire, who you would want with you in the thick of battle. Keep these folks with you the rest of your career.\n\nOn the business model: Besides being a great rainmaker selling and fulfilling heavy demand from customers, ascertain what you can do to ensure the world continues to stay more in your favor post-pandemic. Are there any adjustments that need to be made in terms of cost structure, loyalty point system or membership model?\n\nOn customer retention: How do you continue to build and keep people using your product when things go back to normal? What additional products can you offer? How can you continue to be \u2018addictive\u2019 to your customers who will be going out more and may not be engaging as much on your collaborative tool or edtech platform? Do you need to create new digital content and marketing strategy?\n\nWhile things are good now, take a step back, and think about what the new normal will be and your business\u2019 place in this new reality. If anything, coronavirus has put an accelerant on digitalization and adoption of many new things for consumers including online shopping, remote working, online education and productivity tools.\n\nThe shift of consumer behavior in Southeast Asia will also enable the growth of other verticals including logistics and fintech. Ironically, we also see consumers returning to similar behavior we\u2019ve seen in previous recessions or downturns, which is a shift towards more budget-friendly spending. Another outcome of all this is greater demand for more cost-efficient and better solutions from consumers, pushing founders to reiterate and refine business ideas, models and solutions.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349636", "author": ["Peng T Ong"]}, {"title": "The Great Potential Of Decentralized Finance in 2020", "text": "July 21, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nBefore Ethereum there was Bitcoin, and all hopes were put into the community and its capabilities to develop the network. When Ether entered the game, it opened up a new realm of possibilities for its decentralized applications. Its smart contracts and tokenization capabilities started a conversation about the next steps for traditional finance and how it can take advantage of this new technology. However, it is important to know the difference between traditional financial tools and those built on decentralized networks. Let us delve into what distinguishes decentralized finance (DeFi) from traditional finance, and also discuss some potential use cases for dApps (decentralized applications) and the current regulatory issues related to DeFi.\n\nJust a year ago, when DeFi Pulse started publishing statistics on the monetary value locked in DeFi, the total amount was $276 million. Today, nearly $2 billion is locked in the DeFi market.\n\nThe groundwork for more potential capabilities of DeFi instruments has been laid. As Chris Burniske from venture capital firm Placeholder noted: \u201cIf you think DeFi will have a smaller impact on ETH than ICOs, you aren't paying attention. The ICO boom showcased Ethereum's ability to perform one financial service: early-stage capital formation. DeFi will showcase Ethereum's ability to perform all financial services.\u201d\n\nDuring these uncertain times, the adoption rate of innovative banking solutions is increasing rapidly. Therefore, the current economic challenges facing countries, companies and individuals could lead to better solutions for the future.\n\nTraditional Apps vs dApps: Application vs Protocols\n\nWhat\u2019s the big difference between the applications that we use daily, like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and decentralized applications, like asset management tools and exchanges? Previously, protocols such as HTTP built data directly on the application layer. Investing in applications produced higher returns than investing in protocol technologies. This is why most popular applications consist of \u2018fat\u2019 applications and \u2018thin\u2019 protocols. In blockchain, this relationship is reversed, with most of the value concentrated at the shared \u2018fat\u2019 protocol layer while the \u2018thin\u2019 application layer provides a limited interface service.\n\nThe shared protocol layer and open network is what makes decentralized applications stand out. Big corporations monopolize their user data by capturing users with their interface. Most social network applications do not share any data between each other, which forces users to stick to their favorite interfaces. Meanwhile, blockchain networks can\u2019t own a certain interface because they are each built independently, using many of the same protocols.\n\nExisting infrastructure makes developing these applications easier and cheaper, which, in turn, leaves more room for updates and releases. As Joel Monergo from Placeholder explained: \u201cThe relationship between protocols and applications is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer. It's a stack with 'fat' protocols and 'thin' applications.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to remember that the industry will thrive if the community grows and attracts innovative specialists. Crypto expert and successful blockchain entrepreneur, Alexander Salnikov, considers this influx of talent key to the future health of the industry: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about putting together protocols and interfaces. What we need in that the DeFi space has more talented and motivated entrepreneurs. Opportunities for businesses to generate profit will attract more talent and encourage further developments which are beneficial for both the protocols and their interfaces.\u201d\n\nDApps Functionality\n\nAccording to defiprime, currently, out of the 205 DeFi projects listed, 193 are built on Ethereum. The largest chunk of this market consists of lending dApps. Some platforms also enable users to enter into leveraged positions, utilizing tokenized margin lending and trading. Through smart contracts, lenders and borrowers can interact directly, making lending easier and faster. The adoption of such technology will inevitably bring to light the issues within the traditional global banking systems and offer an alternative, decentralized solution.\n\nThe more funds get channeled into the DeFi sector, the more diversity it brings to the ecosystem. While lending and credit systems, asset management tools and other crypto-finance applications dominate the space, there are unlimited possibilities of what dApps can bring to the table. The architecture that allows outsourcing various tasks to shared networks makes building new applications fast and cheap which is great for startups.\n\n\u201cDeFi projects have great compatibility with each other which means that new features can be developed and then implemented into existing and new services. All of DeFi was built with these tools, these so-called \u2018money legos\u2019, that can be put together in any way, because the technology is open, programmable and flexible,\u201d Alexander adds.\n\nGetting paid for freelance work and reaching agreements with freelance specialists is also made easy and safe with smart contracts. Ethlance is a blockchain job board that allows payments only in cryptocurrency. There is also a crypto-collectibles world where artists can tokenize their work and the buyer can display it in their virtual gallery. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, these tokens are non-fungible which means that every asset is unique or limited in quantity. There are already marketplaces for these collectibles such as Rarible, and VR galleries where they are displayed such as Cryptovoxels.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe blockchain and crypto industries still face many challenges due to regulatory concerns. Completely decentralized applications raise flags with regulators over fraudulent transactions and money laundering matters. There is also some uneasiness regarding all the responsibility put upon developers in the decentralized application field.\n\nWith mainstream institutional giants venturing into DeFi, users are getting a broader variety of services and providers. However, at this moment, only custodial wallets can be reliably regulated because of their standard KYC/AML procedures.\n\nSimultaneously, the current regulatory flux could provide a perfect opportunity to enter the market. Ivan Starinin, experienced blockchain entrepreneur, who has made a name for himself with several successful projects, agrees: \u201cThere is currently a lack of regulation that creates concerns for those who want to invest large amounts into the market. The same pattern we saw with blockchain and crypto, where regulation trailed behind technology, is happening now with DeFi. However, this lack of regulation means we are only at the initial stage of development and there are plenty of opportunities for higher revenue and ecosystem development\u201d.\n\nThe Future of Finance is Decentralized\n\nSome community members have already dubbed 2020 the year of the \u201cDeFi Renaissance.\u201d Amidst the global health and economic crisis, stablecoins have risen in popularity bringing new institutional and individual players into the market. DeFi token values have surged by 200per cent since the beginning of the year. The opportunities for startups using this technology are endless which is promising for the DeFi ecosystem diversification and growth. New game-changing DeFi applications are going to emerge, built at a lesser cost and primed to cross over into the mass market.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353588", "author": ["Emma Cassel"]}, {"title": "97% Enterprises Claim COVID-19 Boosted Their Digital Transformation Efforts: Twilio Report", "text": "July 21, 2020 3 min read\n\nTwilio, a leader in cloud communications platform, on Tuesday announced the results of a global survey measuring the impact and outlook of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses\u2019 digital engagement strategies.\n\nThe San Francisco-based firm surveyed over 2,500 enterprises to understand the magnitude of the pandemic on the firms and their digital transformation and communication roadmap.\n\nThe report titled The COVID-19 Digital Engagement Report is a snapshot of how businesses have addressed the complex challenges posed by this crisis and how they will continue to evolve moving forward.\n\nThe report found out that the pandemic has accelerated companies\u2019 digital communications strategy by an average of six years.

Entrepreneurial skills like pitching, pivoting and acceding resources beyond your control will be essential in everyone's working life.\n\nYour kid doesn\u2019t need to actually be running a business, employing people and presenting pitch decks to investors in order to gain these skills - Being a kid is stressful enough. Introducing your child or teen to entrepreneurial ideas can be simple. Things like describing work as something fun and creative, letting kids buy the groceries online, paying pocket-money for results rather than chores and getting a teen to pitch using PowerPoint slides for that pet they want you to buy. Simple ideas that are fun, entrepreneurial and valuable.\n\nAfter gathering stories from over 200 parents, we found four cornerstones of raising entrepreneurial kids.\n\n1. Develop an entrepreneur mindset\n\nInstilling them with beliefs and values that are aligned to entrepreneurship can start early. Beliefs like \u201cmaking mistakes is part of \u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of money out there for the right opportunity\u201d are worthwhile beliefs. An entrepreneur mindset will give them an awareness of opportunities to create something of value, to positively disrupt a situation, to collaborate towards an outcome or to make money other own terms. Rather than seeing the world of work as something to be endured and tolerated, you\u2019ll give them an understanding that work can be fun, creative and rewarding.\n\nRelated: Here's How You Can Encourage Creative Thinking in Children\n\n2. Introduce entrepreneurial skills\n\nGiving them a chance to develop skills like sales, pitching, marketing, product creation, accounting, customer service, deal-making, negotiation and leadership will change their life no matter what they eventually do for work. Rather than purely focusing on the academic skills that are needed to get good grades, raising entrepreneurial kids is about developing the soft skills that are often associated with dynamic careers.\n\n3. Give them real-world opportunities\n\nWe learn by doing. We also learn by experimenting, tinkering and making mistakes. Rather than shielding your children from the outside world, protect them as they interact with real-life entrepreneurial scenarios that teach powerful lessons. Get them talking to the neighbors about doing their lawnmowing, encourage them to sell items on Facebook Marketplace or go and talk to a marketing agency about their product idea.\n\n4. Mentor them (rather than teach)\n\nat any stage of business can benefit from the guidance of a coach or mentor. Coaching is based on the premise that the answer is there if you go looking and get resourceful. A coach or a mentor guides kids towards more resourceful ideas and behaviors without necessarily telling them the answers. You may also encourage your children to meet and learn about entrepreneurs who create jobs rather than work in them, who have invented something, done deals or managed a successful business. Introducing your kids to entrepreneurial role-models in the real world can leave a lasting impression that \u201cif it\u2019s possible for them it\u2019s possible for me\u201d.\n\nChildren as young as 4 will respond to ideas like delayed gratification, helping others, being rewarded and paying money for things. For those with teens, you\u2019ll see the spark of creative ignite if you challenge them to earn money selling items online, offering a car-cleaning service in the neighborhood or helping a small business get set up with social media accounts.\n\nUltimately the bigger picture of raising an entrepreneurial kid is not about pushing your child to be the next Steve Jobs or Anita Roddick \u2014 it doesn\u2019t even matter if they never start a business at all in their life. What matters most is that your child feels a sense of control in this strange world at this strange time in human history. They feel they have the power to set good goals that are right for them, pursue those goals and pivot when they chose to. These ideas and skills will serve them no matter what they chose to do.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn\u2019t about balance sheets and profit targets, it\u2019s about serving others in a scalable and sustainable way. It\u2019s about finding solutions to complex problems and enrolling others into your vision. As humanity comes closer and closer to the edge of what\u2019s possible and what\u2019s wise, more than ever we will need people who are ready to lead in a world that has difficult decisions.\n\nThe entrepreneurial skills you develop in your child today might be the key to them having a great career, starting a game-changing business or solving a meaningful problem at scale.\n\nNote: Keep an eye out for the book \"How to Raise Entrepreneurial Kids\" which will be out late 2020.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353191", "author": ["Daniel Priestley"]}, {"title": "Make an Empire, Not a Business", "text": "July 17, 2020 3 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nMake an empire, not a business.\n\nIf you want to be timeless, you need to be flexible.\n\nThe thing about my business is that, if the situation requires changing the business model or expansion, I don\u2019t need to start from the beginning. I know the components of what my business does \u2014 outsourcing services, media services, e-commerce, to name a few.

It\u2019s vital to be constantly aware of changes happening in your target market and the overall global business environment and move with it, as the situation requires.\n\nHere are tips to help you think big:\n\nThink globally\n\nIn your mind, your business should be global and not limited to a small location. When you think in global terms, you will get ideas and a vision to make it reach that level.\n\nIndeed, your mind is as vast (or narrow) as you make it. And with the current global reach, online and offline, there is no reason why you shouldn\u2019t think globally.\n\nInstead of thinking about your store in a small locality, imagine your branch in every city of the world.\n\nExpand your offerings\n\nDon\u2019t limit to one product or service. Amazon can sell books as well as farm produce. No one questions it when it tries to go into electric cars or anything else. Elon Musk can do space exploration, electric cars, and online payment processing.

No matter how small or seemingly insignificant your business is, don\u2019t allow it to stop you from putting your message in front of global industry leaders.\n\nOverdeliver\n\nThe way your business presents itself should be flawless. If you can make your clients 100% happy, make them 120% happy. If you can deliver 110% results, deliver 200%.\n\nBe in the business of helping customers\n\nMake your customer\u2019s your only goal when you provide a service or product. Ask yourself, what is it that my customer wants to achieve. And then make sure what you deliver does that, irrespective of the amount the customer paid or whether you provided the service free.\n\nRelated: How to Start a Side Hustle With Little or No Money\n\nEmbrace hope\n\nI believe in the power of prayer.

Your clients love you, you love running your business and serving your clients and you\u2019re always striving to improve on your skills. Your business couldn\u2019t be better ... or could it?\n\nAs a business owner, much of your time is spent focussing on ways to reach your clients and help them \u2014 and that makes sense, because the work you do is important. But the easiest way to increase profits can be overlooked, and that's by looking at your internal structure.\n\nIf you\u2019re not keeping your bookkeeping records organized and current, you are wasting an opportunity to tighten your costs and increase the financial health of your business. When your books are current and set up well, you can run those numbers and get extremely valuable feedback on how your business is performing.\n\nThe top five benefits of keeping your books current are:\n\n1. Know your cash flow.\n\nCash flow is one of the most important areas that keeps you in business \u2014 if you can\u2019t pay your bills, you won\u2019t stay in business for long. So if you\u2019re short on cash, that will likely stress you out and keep you up at night.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Bank study, 82 percent of business failure is caused by poor cash management.\n\nWhen your books are set up with a good system, understanding your cash flow position is as quick as clicking a button to run your report. You\u2019ll know what bills you have coming up, and if you have enough cash in the bank to cover them. This allows for proper planning and if a potential problem arises, you can be aware of the fact before it stresses you out and allows you to be proactive.\n\nRelated: How POS Is Improving the Efficiency Of Business Accounting\n\n2. Be on top of client payments.\n\nIf you want to keep your books current, you have to invoice clients immediately, which gets your payment in the door a lot more quickly. You can also run reports on a weekly basis that will show when clients are late in payment, so you can follow up more quickly and prevent a late payment from becoming an issue. This helps with maintaining excellent client relationships and retention because your client will appreciate your organized and efficient follow-up, rather than having a payment dispute down the road.\n\nRelated: 3 Essentials for Building a Loyal Customer Base\n\n3. Save money on late payments.\n\nCurrent books mean you know what payments are due when and you can manage your cash flow to ensure you have the cash to pay the bills when they\u2019re due. This saves a lot of money on late fees and interest charges. And this helps maintain supplier relations. Your suppliers will value you as a good client, and often offer benefits or discounts for preferred clients. And if you\u2019re in a pinch and need special attention from them, they\u2019ll help you out happily.\n\nAccording to Sage, one in 10 invoices are paid late, resulting in a global impact of $3 trillion.\n\n4. Know your profit margins and adjust accordingly.\n\nYou know what profit margins you want to keep in your company, and when you set up your books to account for each line of service or product you offer, when your profit margins are falling short, you can correct immediately. If a supplier increases the price of a product you need from them, you will see immediately how that will impact your bottom line. When you see the cost structure of the product you sell you can easily make adjustments and scenarios to see how these changes affect the overall margins for the products.\n\nRelated: What Are the Top Five Things That to Keep in Mind While Using Accounting Software?\n\n5. Identify the money leaks before they become a big problem.\n\nWhen your books are current, you can see where you are spending more on a service than you intended to. Marketing is typically a large expense, so keeping current records allows you to monitor the dollars you\u2019ve spent there and helps you manage your budget accordingly.\n\nRunning regular reports allows you to determine earlier on when you are spending too much on a certain expense in your business.\n\nThe bottom line is when you keep a good accounting system in your business, your financial reports will identify issues early in the process and resolve issues before they become a bigger problem, and you can plug money leaks in your business very quickly. Just by tightening up your accounting processes and procedures, when you start plugging money leaks, make cost adjustments and changes, you are ensuring you are keeping your business profitable.\n\nWhen you see how these systems make your life so much easier and help you make your business that much more profitable, you\u2019ll wonder what took you so long to get these systems in place. These systems take a lot of stress out of running a business because you will be confident that you know your business, you understand the financial health of the business, and you make informed business decisions that you will know are increasing your bottom line, the profit line.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353322", "author": ["Melissa Houston"]}, {"title": "Planning to Self-Publish Your First Book? Avoid These 6 Rookie Mistakes at All Costs", "text": "July 20, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWriting a book might not be the first thing that comes to mind for growing your business, but this can go a long way in helping establish their credentials and industry expertise. It helps get your name out there, and can even lead to media coverage for you and your company.\n\nBest of all, the rise of has made authorship more accessible than ever for entrepreneurs. You don\u2019t need to seek out a deal with a major publisher. Instead, you can self-publish and start selling your book on Amazon or promoting it through your site.\n\nWhile self-publishing allows you to get your book to market quickly, self-publishing is rife with potential pitfalls. Avoiding these six rookie mistakes will ensure that you look like a professional, not a novice.\n\n1. Skipping the editing process\n\nYou aren\u2019t done with your book once you type \u201cthe end\u201d or its equivalent. published by major publishers go through several rounds of revisions and edits before they hit store shelves. If you neglect editing your self-published book, you risk coming across as sloppy and unprofessional.\n\nEditing should cover grammar and spelling issues, but it can also reveal flaws in the structure or organization of your book. You might not have put enough emphasis on certain topics, or maybe you repeated certain points multiple times in the text. Enlist the help of a few beta readers to go through your manuscript to get an idea of what is or isn\u2019t working.\n\nRelated: Why Every Entrepreneur Should Write a Book\n\n2. Picking a poor title\n\nA title can make or break any piece of entertainment \u2014 be it a book, newspaper article or movie. Your title needs to grab the audience\u2019s attention while still giving them an idea of what to expect in your book.\n\nOne common suggestion for business and other nonfiction books is to combine a \u201ccreative\u201d title with an indicative subtitle that tells readers what your book is about.\n\nAs one example, Greenville University\u2019s Deloy Cole explains, \"Eats, Shoots and Leaves: A Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation, is a masterful combination of creative title with meticulous, content-oriented subtitle. The title alone wouldn\u2019t make a reader aware of the book\u2019s subject (apart from actually reading the book), but the subtitle turns the book into something other than an ambiguous scene of gustatory violence.\u201d\n\n3. Not hiring a professional cover designer\n\nFew things will drive readers away like an ugly front cover. The visual elements of your book\u2019s cover will often catch a reader\u2019s eye before the title does. Unless you\u2019re a professional graphic designer, this means you should turn this job over to a professional who will design an engaging cover that matches the content of your book.\n\nJust how important is a book cover, exactly?\n\nA survey by The Book Smugglers found that 79 percent of readers reported that book covers played a \u201cdecisive role\u201d when deciding to buy a book, with 48 percent saying the cover played \u201ca major role.\u201d With hardcover books, 40 percent said an ugly cover would even keep them from buying a book they were previously interested in.\n\n4. Neglecting your book\u2019s marketing needs\n\nMany entrepreneurs self-publish a book as a form of marketing for their business. But your book also needs to be marketed to make an impact. In an email conversation, J.J. Hebert, president of MindStir Media, a self-publishing services company, explained, \u201cEvery book needs a marketing plan that starts before release and continues for at least a few months after the book releases. Hundreds of thousands of books are self-published every year. A few social media posts aren\u2019t going to get you the traction you need to stand out and get meaningful sales numbers.\u201d\n\nIn addition to social media campaigns, self-published authors should use email lists and newsletters to tell subscribers about the book. Actively participating in online industry groups will ensure that when you talk about your book, you won\u2019t come across as spammy. Media outreach (especially on a local level) can also drive momentum for your book release.\n\n5. Forgetting print and digital formatting\n\nSelf-publishing is very much a DIY endeavor \u2014 and that often includes formatting the book. Even if you\u2019ve thoroughly edited your book\u2019s content, it will still look sloppy and unprofessional if the text isn\u2019t formatted properly. Even seemingly minor details like section breaks or the type of file you upload can make a difference.\n\nAuthors should be mindful of all formatting guidelines for the program they are using and carefully review the text for any issues before publishing. Remember, ebooks and print books often have different formatting standards. You\u2019ll want to review all versions of your book to ensure that digital readers don\u2019t get an inferior experience.\n\nRelated: 3 Lessons You\u2019ll Learn by Writing a Book About Your Business\n\n6. Poor pricing\n\nBe careful to avoid overpricing or underpricing your book. Pricing a self-published ebook for over $10 will seem too expensive for many buyers. On the other hand, underpricing could indicate to readers that your book isn\u2019t very good. For ebooks, the self-publishing sweet spot is usually around $2.99 to $5.99, depending on the length of the book.\n\nFor print books, you can (and should) go higher to cover the related printing costs. Many full-length paperbacks will sell for $14.99, and some business books are even more. Find a good balance between profitability and an attractive price point.\n\nSet yourself up for self-publishing success\n\nWhen done right, self-publishing can make a big difference for your personal brand. It can even serve as an additional source of revenue that earns money on its own in addition to driving new leads to your business. By taking the time to do self-publishing right, you will make more sales and make a strong, positive impression on your readers.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353397", "author": ["Lucas Miller"]}, {"title": "The Millennial Takeover: How the Generation is Shaking up the Workplace", "text": "July 21, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIn the next five years, the U.S. workplace is poised to experience a changing of the guard.\n\nThe majority of Baby Boomers, now in their upper 50s, 60s, and lower 70s, will be well into retirement age. Their vacated executive positions and managerial roles will most likely be filled by up-and-coming Gen Xers and , if they haven\u2019t already.\n\nCurrently the largest living generation in the U.S., by 2025 Millennials will account for 75 percent of the American workforce. While their habits as consumers often get maligned in the media for bringing about decline in industries and products as wide-ranging as napkins, cable TV, soda, razors, golf, mayonnaise, traditional weddings, department stores, starter homes, and \u201cbreastaurants,\u201d what they bring to the table\u2014rather than take off it\u2014deserves more of the limelight.\n\nLove them or hate them, here are major cultural shifts you can expect to see in the workplace as more Millennials take charge.\n\nMission-driven brands\n\nWhile the jury is still out on whether Millennials are more or less brand loyal than preceding generations (some studies say they are, some say they aren\u2019t, and some say it depends on the product category), one thing is for certain: Millennials value brands that demonstrate authenticity, and that authenticity is shown by remaining true to a cause.\n\nThis is the case for both patronage and workplace preference. Millennials want to buy from and work for businesses that have a purpose at their core. A job is no longer just about a paycheck and putting food on the family table; for Millennials, it\u2019s very much about purpose, with 75 percent saying they want their personal values to align with their company\u2019s values and are even willing to take a pay cut to work for a value-aligned company.\n\nCo-authors John Izzo and Jeff Vanderweilen call it the forthcoming \u201cPurpose Revolution.\u201d Employees, customers and investors are increasingly looking beyond a company\u2019s bottom line to ask how it\u2019s making the world a better place. In the age of social good, the line between for-profit and not-for-profit becomes less rigid, and brands like TOMS, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Patagonia and Warby Parker are all lead actors, as they put their social corporate responsibility front and center, a scorecard against which the world can judge their success. Expect Millennials to continue wearing their social causes on their sleeves as they move up the ranks and have a greater say in shaping their own company\u2019s mission.\n\nEmpathetic\n\nAnother area in which you can expect to see Millennials making change is in leadership style. Fading are the days of the corporate strongman, whose word becomes instant workplace policy, and whose authority is derived solely by title or position.\n\nIt could be the result of growing up in a postmodern era, but many Millennials are very aware, and skeptical, of power dynamics, and tend to see legitimate authority as earned rather than assumed. Consequently, Millennials respond better to leaders who inspire by example and embody the mission of the company. A big part of authentic leadership is the willingness to solicit feedback and hear out ideas, not just from one\u2019s own C-suite peers, but from all levels of an organization.\n\nThat ability to understand and share the feelings of others is what we call empathy, and it\u2019s a huge component of emotional intelligence. Empathy is especially important for leaders, as they need to understand what truly motivates their team in order to build a successful, thriving culture on that foundation. Moreover, empathy is especially important today, as Daniel Goleman writes in Harvard Business Review, for three main reasons:\n\nWork is increasingly team-based\n\nThe world is increasingly globalized, requiring coordination among diverse persons\n\nSuccess is often dependent on retaining the best talent\n\nAs they step into leadership roles, expect Millennials to perform like the kind of leaders they most respect\u2014the charismatic, caring, and listening kind.\n\nFlattened hierarchy\n\nEver noticed how suits, once a staple of corporate America (Mad Men, anyone?), are slowly losing their prominence among the office dress code?\n\nYou could blame it on Silicon Valley. Tech execs like Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg have for years evinced a dressed-down style that\u2019s more Tony Hawk than Tom Ford. The trend is so prevalent that Vox declared suits are now mostly reserved for \u201cpowerful men when they\u2019re in trouble\u201d (aka Zuckerberg at a Congressional hearing).\n\nBut the waning popularity of suits is symptomatic of something bigger than just workplace fashion trends. It\u2019s about corporate structure. Along with open offices, corporate town halls, employee stock ownership, and rotating team leaders, casual attire is part of a larger Millennial-driven trend toward a flattened hierarchy in the workplace.\n\nSometimes described as a \u201cflat organization\u201d or a \u201cholacracy,\u201d a flattened hierarchy reduces bureaucracy overall and aims to eliminate the mid-management levels between executives and entry-level employees. Shrinking that gap has a number of advantages. Besides reducing unnecessary labor costs, it stresses individual responsibility and encourages each team member\u2019s personal investment in the company; facilitates a freer flow of communication; allows for quicker, more nimble decision-making; and empowers team members to be proactive in leading and offering solutions rather than placing that burden entirely on the shoulders of the CEO.\n\nAnd a flattened hierarchy is more in line with the type of leadership Millennials most resonate with\u2014the kind that\u2019s on their level rather than in some aloof, top-floor corner office.\n\nAt home with disruption\n\nBorn between 1981 and 1996, Millennials have grown up witnessing tremendous technological change, from the introduction of computers in the home, to dial-up internet, the dot-com boom, broadband, nearly ubiquitous Wi-Fi, the Internet of Things, cloud computing, self-driving vehicles, smartphones, smart houses, smart everything.\n\nNobody knows more experientially than Millennials the evidence for Moore\u2019s Law\u2014that computer chip-based technology seems to double every one-and-a-half to two years. Needless to say, for them, disruption has become clich\u00e9, a buzzword that\u2019s lost its buzz.\n\nWhile \u201cdigital natives\u201d may gloss over the fact that Millennials come from diverse upbringings with unequal access to technology, the gist remains: as a generation accustomed to constant software updates and the breakneck pace of change, Millennials understand that successful businesses need to be ready to adapt or die.\n\nConsider Apple\u2019s goal to roll out a new iPhone every year and Facebook\u2019s frequent overhauls. The generation that\u2019s brought us Airbnb, Lyft, Groupon, Spotify, Tinder, Oculus RV, Stripe and nearly every social media platform imaginable will make it a key operational philosophy for the companies under their watch to remain relevant or risk fading into obscurity.\n\nFlexible work/life\n\nThat same saturation with communication technologies that earns Millennials the label of digital natives has also taught them how hard it can be to \u201cturn off.\u201d When your mobile phone is your work phone and an office email can appear on your smartwatch at any time, the traditional nine-to-five schedule can take on the dreamlike aura of a bygone time in which it was once possible to keep work life enjoyably distinct from personal life.\n\nIn reaction, many Millennials have pushed back against the \u201calways-on\u201d expectations at their jobs and advocated for better work/life balance in their careers, which makes sense. Burn out is real, and it\u2019s no secret that happier people are more productive employees, and more likely to stick around.\n\nThe irony is that the very technologies that make us accessible around the clock and thus the potential victim of 24/7 work demands are the same technologies that can deliver better work/life balance. For many skill-based creative professions, digital technologies allow for flexible work hours, telecommuting, location independence and a number of other benefits that boost individual control over one\u2019s own work life.\n\nAs we reach a generational tipping point that sees more Millennials in leadership positions, expect them to introduce more workplace policies that contribute to employee happiness, particularly ones that increase self-autonomy and protect work/life balance.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353284", "author": ["Danny Beckett Jr."]}, {"title": "How to Expand Hiring in a New Business", "text": "May 1, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nMost new entrepreneurs are eager to expand as quickly as possible. They see growth as the fuel necessary to succeed, and to achieve growth, you need to invest in more resources and a further reach. However, if you aren\u2019t careful, expanding too quickly can work against you. So how can you scale up your hiring efforts without running into long-term problems that could threaten your business?\n\nThe Problems With Hiring Too Quickly\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at the main problems with hiring too quickly and hiring too many people:\n\nExpenses. Employees are one of the largest expenses a new business will face, and if you aren\u2019t careful, their costs can quickly overwhelm the business. If you\u2019re suddenly tripling your staff, with little groundwork or revenue to support that increase, your business might not be in a position to survive long-term.\n\nEmployees are one of the largest expenses a new business will face, and if you aren\u2019t careful, their costs can quickly overwhelm the business.

Culture retention. Speaking of culture, establishing bigger teams and/or teams in new locations can dilute your culture if you aren\u2019t careful.

First, make sure you take the time to truly analyze and inventory your needs. You want your business to expand, but how quickly do you really need to expand, and how many employees do you really need to accomplish this? For example, you might have a vision for a future with 10 locations and a team of 15 employees per location, but could you accomplish the same results, or nearly the same results, with just eight locations? Or with 12 employees per location? What would those extra two locations or three employees per location be doing? The more exacting you are, the more unnecessary expenses you\u2019ll be able to trim away before you even spend them.\n\nFirst, make sure you take the time to truly analyze and inventory your needs.

Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | IndieBound.\n\nThere\u2019s a widely used acronym that you may have heard of: KISS \u2014 keep it simple, stupid. But it\u2019s an old saying, and it needs updating. How about, \u201cKeep it simple, smarty\u201d? Simple is the new smart, and it is, in fact, exactly what most people need to focus on when .\n\nLet\u2019s talk about some key ways you can set up your ageless startup\u2019s mission, values and in a way that provides simplicity and clarity for both you and your customers.\n\nDetermine Your Mission\n\nAt the heart of every new enterprise is the organization\u2019s mission. A mission statement is a short, succinct statement about how you\u2019ll position your organization to interact with the world. What is your business purpose, its meaning and the basis of how you want your new enterprise to serve the field in which it operates?\n\nA mission statement isn\u2019t just an outwardly focused marketing statement, though it is that to some degree. A mission statement is also a very important internal tool for running your business. When you come to a fork in the road, such as deciding whether to take on a new customer or provide a service to another company (for the money or for its relevance to your mission statement), you have the guidance in hand to make that decision. You\u2019ve put up the guard rails to help your future self live up to the potential of the opportunity. You know what your mission is, so you can create partnerships that reflect your values.\n\nA mission statement should motivate you, inspire you and be your key tool for presenting your opportunity to the world. Large businesses often write mission statements to please a wide range of stakeholders and end up pleasing no one. Because you\u2019re an artisan entrepreneur focused on niche markets, you can hone your words to speak to specific problems that inspire action in your own heart and mind and in the responses from customers you want to serve.\n\nA mission statement should specifically cite the purpose of the organization, however inelegant and confusing it might be to others not in your target market. For instance, most people would not care about or even understand the mission statement I use for my current startup. It leaves out almost everyone. My current mission statement is, \u201cI want to make this region the artisan food manufacturing capital of North America.\u201d The people who matter to this project will know exactly what the goal of my current work is and appreciate its importance.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s important to remember that mission statements aren\u2019t written in stone. Adapt them carefully as your circumstances and markets change. Your mission statement will be your guiding star as you sail into the future. Choose it carefully and rely on it.\n\nIdentify Your Values\n\nThe new best practice in business is to emphasize your personal goals, values and ambitions for changing the world in your . By doing so, you\u2019ll attract the customers you need and send those with discordant value systems off to where they belong.\n\nThese are the values you need to use to steer your enterprise. Keep these simple. Be direct. Don\u2019t use extra words. The values you build into your new enterprise are values you must live by yourself. A sample values statement might be, \u201cWe\u2019ll treat every customer as though they\u2019re our family, with respect and understanding.\u201d\n\nKeeping your value statement simple and direct also allows you to be true to yourself and true to your business mission. You\u2019re working to share the values you\u2019re passionate about. Be clear, and keep it simple. The purpose of a values statement isn\u2019t to impress. It\u2019s to educate people about what\u2019s important to you and your business.\n\nThink about what makes you angry with business practices you encounter. What frustrates you about the way people are dealing with subjects you care deeply about? How would you approach the issue differently? Business practices are driven by the value systems behind them. Let this guide you.\n\nSet Your Goals\n\nWith your mission and values in place, you can establish goals for the journey. How will you combine your passion, mission statement and values statement to get the results you want? You establish metrics you can measure. What steps can you put in place to meet your mission and the values behind it?\n\nFollowing KISS principles, you\u2019ll want to identify realistic goals that have meaning and consequence. As solo entrepreneurs, we need to include goals that benefit ourselves and our businesses. Your business goals should be simple, clear, and transparent. Your KISS approach calls for answers that are easy to understand for all who see them. A KISS version of business goals might look like these:\n\nWe will grow and maintain a sustainable, profitable organization.\n\nWe will add one new client per month for the next 12 months.\n\nWe will answer all new inquiries within 24 hours.\n\nGoals help you complete your mission and put your values into action. Goals make your new enterprise work. What problems lay in the way of completing your mission and the values that drive it? How would you get around those obstacles? How could you create a better system that would avoid or solve those problems? Those are your goals.\n\nHow do you know which goals will be most effective to help you carry out your mission? Reverse the design of your products and services. Reverse the design of your enterprise. For the specific problem at hand, start with your answer.\n\nBuild your goals with this result in mind. How have you made the solution simpler? How have you made the process easier? If you want sustainable work, think simple.\n\nMission statements, values statements and goals should be written in service of honoring your passion. Get that right, and you\u2019ve got a high-value ageless startup.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/347161", "author": ["Rick Terrien"]}, {"title": "Meet Omaze, the Celebrity-Endorsed Juggernaut That Has Raised Over $100 Million for Charity", "text": "April 30, 2020 2 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nMatt Pohlson knew that after graduating from business school, he wanted to create a company that would impact the world.

But since he was young, he dreamed of being an entrepreneur. After graduating from Princeton University, Bezos worked for a technology startup. When the company failed, he went to work in the banking industry. With the advent of the internet, Bezos saw his entrepreneurial opportunity: Books! The rest is history. In reflecting back on that moment in time, Bezos said in the biography The Everything Store, \"I knew when I was 80 that I would never, for example, think about why I walked away from my 1994 Wall Street bonus right in the middle of the year at the worst possible time. I knew that I might sincerely regret not having participated in this thing called the internet that I thought was going to be a revolutionizing event.\"\n\nOne of the most common reasons that most people dream about starting a company is because they are unsatisfied with their current work situation. For Bezos, a cushy corporate job on Wall Street offered many benefits; however, deep down, it wasn\u2019t who he was and how he wanted to show up in the world. Bezos knew that he was an entrepreneur at heart. Does this feeling resonate with you? Do you feel stuck in your role at work?

For 15 years, I worked in the banking industry for Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, where I held leadership roles in portfolio management and sales, respectively. Despite having a great manager, working alongside an incredible team and enjoying substantial professional gains at the time, I felt something was missing. Deep down, I knew that there was other work I should be doing in the world. I wanted to wake up every day feeling I was doing the work that mattered to me most.\n\nSpurred on by these feelings, I worked nights and weekends for more than five years to build an adventure travel company, The Explorer\u2019s Passage, on the side. Eventually, my business became successful enough for me to to leave banking and run it full time. It hasn\u2019t always been easy \u2014 entrepreneurship is tough.

I'm living proof of that.\n\nRelated: Five Signs That You Have A Great Business Idea\n\nIf you're open to the idea of launching your own company, you have one big decision to make: what your new business will do. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 most people struggle with this aspect. Even Jeff Bezos went through an exhaustive ideation process before he settled on selling books. It can be scary and overwhelming to begin this process. But if you take it step by step, it becomes manageable. Before you know it, you'll have an incredible idea that you're passionate about.\n\nIn my experience, you need to construct an idea that answers three key questions:\n\nWhat are you good at?

Sometimes we don\u2019t realize what we're good at because it comes so naturally to us. We believe that we're supposed to work hard at our jobs, so we think that this attribute can't possibly be our purpose.\n\nRelated: Looking for a Business Idea? Turn What Other People Complain About Into an Opportunity.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example.

His brother Kimbal Musk said in an interview with Rolling Stone, \u201cHe\u2019s able to see things more clearly in a way that no one else I know of can understand. There\u2019s a thing in chess where you can see 12 moves ahead if you\u2019re a grandmaster. And in any particular situation, Elon can see things 12 moves ahead.\u201d Musk businesses are a reflection of these innate skills.\n\nWhen I was attending college near Princeton University, I would always bring friends and family to campus to show them around and give them custom tours. I would talk about the history and architecture of the university. I would show them all the beautiful spots I loved. It was just something I naturally did because I enjoyed it. I didn\u2019t turn it into a business at the time, but everyone knew that if they wanted to see Princeton, then they should go with me. It took me 15 years to realize that maybe I could do this for a living \u2014 showing people the beautiful places around the world that I loved.\n\nRelated: Is Your Business Idea Good?

After all, it costs money to run a business. Entrepreneurs need to generate revenue if they want to experience any type of lasting success. But I'm not suggesting you give away the cow at no cost, as it were. Rather, that by strategically introducing giveaways or gratis add-ons, you can enjoy significant future growth, and in these five specific areas.\n\n1. Growing your leads list\n\nFree offers are a tried-and-true method of lead generation. Many B2B brands will provide ebooks or other materials in exchange for signing up for their newsletter. This serves as an easy way to collect email addresses that can be leveraged in future marketing campaigns. This type of giveaway is so widespread that Content Marketing Institute reports that 88 percent of B2B companies use content marketing for lead generation.\n\nOf course, similar tactics can also prove effective when selling consumer products. Many brands use product giveaways that encourage people to follow them on social media or sign up for an email list to gain additional entries. The result is more potential buyers who will receive email and social media marketing, leading to future purchases.\n\nRelated: Should You Offer Your Product or Services for Free?\n\n2. Helping others understand what you have to offer\n\nFree trials are a common tactic used by service providers. B2B software companies, video-streaming services and others will typically provide a limited period when users can test out their service for free. This can prove remarkably effective. Growth marketer Lincoln Murphy suggests benchmark conversion rates of 60 percent for trials that require credit card info and 25 percent for \u201copt-in\u201d trials.\n\nA recent conversation with Piotr Orzechowski, CEO of Infermedica, provided further insights. \"In light of COVID-19, we offered a free risk-assessment tool to help triage coronavirus symptoms remotely,\" he explains. \"Ministries of health in Poland and Ukraine implemented this solution on their websites. It was the right thing to do, but it's also allowed organizations to see how our products work. It gives us a chance to show our commitment to quality service, which will undoubtedly lead to new client growth in the future.\"\n\n3. Generating buzz for your brand\n\nProduct giveaways are a great way to grow a following. This is commonly seen with social media contests when a brand or influencer will require that followers tag friends as part of their entry.\n\nWhen done right, this can generate a snowball effect that leads to many people discovering the brand and its products. In fact, a report from Easypromos found that 99.3 percent of contest participants will share links online if the contest incentivizes getting friends to participate.\n\nOf course, the benefits go well beyond brand awareness. Contests can lead to exponential growth in your social media followers and email subscribers. They can also dramatically increase engagement through these channels. More followers and higher engagement will naturally lead to more qualified leads and purchases.\n\n4. Collecting valuable market feedback\n\nYour most loyal customers can serve as an important source of information when testing a new product or service. Speaker and author Brian Tracy has written for this site about how testing products with customers is \u201cthe only real test of a product,\u201d explaining, \u201cGo to a potential customer with your sample or prototype and ask if he would buy it. Be sure to call on the individual who makes buying decisions. Then ask him how much he\u2019d pay for this product. If people criticize your new product idea, ask them why. Ask how the product could be modified to make it more attractive.\u201d\n\nMany customers are willing to test your newest product or service because they view it as a low-risk proposition. They don\u2019t pay anything. They get to try out your next product or service for free and give their honest feedback.\n\nFor your most loyal customers, the potential of being the first to try your next innovation is motivation enough. And the wider of a group you can test, the more diverse and reliable feedback you\u2019ll receive.\n\n5. Upselling purchases\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason why many online retailers like Amazon and Walmart set minimum purchase requirements to qualify for free shipping. It\u2019s an easy way to encourage customers to buy one or two extra products to fill up their shopping cart before checking out. In fact, a UPS study found that in 2017, 48 percent of online shoppers added items to their cart to qualify for free shipping.\n\nSimilar results are possible when you offer a free product or value-added service when customers meet a set minimum purchase threshold. Alternatively, you could bundle a free item with a lower-selling product to boost its sales. Pair relevant products and services together to better upsell to your customers.\n\nRelated: 4 Creative Ways to Use Free Samples to Grow Your Business\n\nFree today, but plenty of profit tomorrow\n\nAs these examples illustrate, giving away products or services for free is all about the long-term results.

The expense is reasonable, allowing small businesses the chance to draw from a customer base they would never have the opportunity to sell their products to otherwise.\n\nOf the almost 70 percent of U.S. adults on Facebook, nearly three-quarters log on at least once a day, and half of those daily users visit the social media giant multiple times a day from their laptops and mobile phones. Facebook's video numbers are astounding:\n\n4 billion video views every day;\n\n100 million hours of video viewed by 500 million viewers every day;\n\n65% of video views on Facebook are played on mobile devices;\n\n85% of Facebook videos are viewed without sound.\n\nRelated: How to Create Killer Facebook Video Ads\n\nTypes and targets for video ads on Facebook\n\nFacebook video ads can build brand awareness, generate web traffic, and hopefully increase your revenue. The primary ad, or hero ad, is the main sales video used to drive traffic to your website or specific landing page. From there, you can also serve ads specifically to people who watch the primary ad but fail to click through to your site, as well as those who click through but do not make a purchase or fulfill other conversion criteria.\n\nFacebook has created and refined a targeting system that will pinpoint who and where your ads will reach. The more specific you can get in determining target audience clusters, the more effective your video campaign ads will be in reaching potential customers. Some of the targeting factors are age, gender, location, language and many others.\n\nThe more information you can collect and apply, the better you will be able to target your video ads to the consumers who are most likely to make a purchase or use your service. Ideally, you have this information from information about your past customers or will have done industry research.\n\nYou can also use a \u201clookalike audience,\u201d which is an audience that Facebook creates for you based on who is likely to be interested in your business because they are similar to your existing customers or website visitors.\n\nRelated: 4 Tips to Create and Groom a Viral Facebook Video Ad\n\nDo your research\n\nOne effective method for compiling useful data on your target customers is to research the hard data you can find in your product or service review entries. If your business is running short on reviews, look at your competitors\u2019 reviews to get an idea of the kinds of keywords and focus phrases you can use to get started.\n\nAs you go through your own reviews or that of your competitors, make a list of the most frequently used phrases or concepts that people focus on, both positive and negative. Use the most mentioned phrases in the copy that accompanies the video.\n\nSpeaking of competitors, one of the best ways to know what you should and shouldn't be doing is to research your competition. Note the companies that provide that same products or services in the same or similar industry as you by examining their strengths and weaknesses. Look at their reviews to see what other people are saying about them and the way they conduct business.\n\nOnce you have a comprehensive study of several of your competitors you can compare and contrast them to your business to figure out your competitive advantages and how you use them to get a leg up in the market. Seek out competitors who are already running Facebook video ads to learn what is working for them. There is a simple process to find ads that your competition is running on Facebook: Go to the business's Page, select \"Page Transparency\" then \u201cGo to Ad Library.\u201d Pay special attention to the messages they are presenting and how. Think about ways you can improve on their concepts and execution. Scroll through the comments section of each video ad to see direct feedback to their ads. Take notes on constructive criticism and honest reactions to apply them to your video production efforts.\n\nRelated: Why Facebook Says Your Video Ads Should Be Silent\n\nStructuring your Facebook video ad\n\nThere are no hard rules for how to structure your Facebook video ad, but the following elements are generally considered an effective way to quickly and clearly get your message across.\n\nHook: Attention spans for Facebook videos are very short, and users are on Facebook to enjoy their feed and be entertained. You need to grab viewers\u2019 attention within the first couple of seconds or they will scroll away to the next video.\n\nIntroduce the problem: Explain the problem you have the capacity to solve in a clear, concise, compelling manner. Make the viewer feel the pain or whatever problem it is you\u2019re presenting\u2014they may not even know they are experiencing it.\n\nPresent your solution: Present your product or service in a quick, dynamic manner. Offering a solution to the problem you have presented is really about showcasing your product or service for the first time.

The traditional way of doing things is over, which means that this is the perfect time invest in influencer marketing, which is effective, efficient, nimble and drives results.\n\nIn terms of measurable ROI, influencer engagement scores much higher than most brand content. Brand videos on Facebook have an average watch time of 4.57 seconds, while influencers get tens of minutes.

As a result, you can work with influencers more cheaply than ever.\n\nInfluencer engagement is skyrocketing\n\nAt the same time influencer pricing is going down, their audience is growing.

In 2019, worldwide digital ad spending will rise by 17.6 per cent to US$333.25 billion, according to eMarkerter. The same report suggests that digital users will account for roughly half of the global ad market. And, there are many factors contributing to the growth of digital ad industry.\n\nJoshua Oshu Kwon, chief strategy officer of a South Korea-based lock screen media platform provider, Buzzvil, pointed outas follows:\n\n5G to Accelerate the Growth of Video Advertisements: It is true that 5G will enable the adtech ecosystem to load faster the things people search for on the internet. Citing reports, Kwon said, \u201cBy this year (2019), 0.4 million users will have access to 5G, and by 2024, the number is expected to surge to 1.4 million.\"\n\nIn order to be adept with the changes, Kwon suggests, \u201cIt is important for advertisers to get a better understanding on how to manage the video ads' campaign in a smarter way, and publishers must come up with a strategy to own more video inventories.\u201d\n\nOmnichannel to enable the Growth of Video Ads: According to Kwon, citing his experience at Buzzvil, when a TV commercial company wants a display ads on its lock screen platform, the same product is being sold on TV. \u201cThis is when they make the most sales,\u201d Kwon said.\n\nAccording to Mary Meeker's 2019 Internet Trends report, 88 per cent of people are on a secondary device while watching TV, searching for what they want to see and talking about it. Kwon suggests, \u201cMarketeers have to be present on phones, computers, TV, tablets and other IoTs. They have to integrate all their data to take necessary actions.\u201d\n\nUsers will Start to Actively Manage how and where their Data is being Used: Citing data regulations such as the GDPR, and similar data privacy regulations being adopted across Europe, Asia, Americas, and other countries, Kwon emphasised that \"industries will have to ensure that the customer data is secure and is managed with full transparency.\"\n\nKwon said, \u201cMore and more users will be sensitive as to how and where their data is being used in the adtech industry, an then start to actively manage it. This trend will mostly be driven by user-borne needs managing their data. Publishers and advertisers can look a closer look at the trend to adapt to the new reality.\"\n\nIndustries should Aim for better Ad Experience: Kwon maintains that doing so will enable industries to remove unwanted ads.

For example, late last year Instagram quietly phased out the \u2018activity\u2019 tab within its app because users were not engaging with it anymore. Or how Apple\u2019s latest iPhones no longer have 3D Touch, because the feature was inadequately responsive.\n\nThe world\u2019s most disruptive and innovative companies are building their offerings around the needs and desires of their users, otherwise known as taking a \u2018customer-centric\u2019 mentality. This shift away from product obsession proves that the modern customer is more powerful than ever, and businesses - be they startups or established organisations - must rise to meet the demands of their growing expectations.\n\nCustomer-centricity is synonymous with successful businesses, especially as markets are saturated with more choice than ever, and savvy customers are increasingly empowered to explore their options. It\u2019s not just about the lowest price anymore - modern customers expect to be understood too.\n\nSo why is the modern customer so powerful?\n\nDespite a saturated marketplace, the customer voice is louder than ever.\n\nNo other era has experienced such readily available information as today\u2019s digital age. The internet and the rise of social media has given customers a platform to express their opinions, reviews and recommendations - it\u2019s also created market comparison tools so customers can find precisely what they\u2019re looking for at the click of a button.\n\nThere are pros and cons of this; word-of-mouth has the potential to become free-user generated content, and companies can now deliver new products that gain visibility instantly, without needing to spend vast amounts of money on global marketing campaigns. Conversely, a bad review can be seen by thousands - collapsing a brand\u2019s reputation almost readily.\n\nResearch shows that 87 per cent of consumers now begin their product search online. Any successful business has an online presence, whether they have actively built one or otherwise. Relinquishing the control of your business\u2019 reputation to cyberspace can be challenging, but it\u2019s a reality for modern organisations.\n\nCustomers are demanding more, and only businesses that adapt to customer-centric processes will survive such a volatile market.\n\nThe Customer Experience and Your Operations\n\nOperational excellence must now be inextricably linked to customer experience, with the connection of persona, journey, and process giving a 360 degree view of improvement.\n\nThe \u2018customer experience\u2019 describes the journey a customer goes on through interactions; from how they first encounter your business, right through to the delivery of a product or service - every touchpoint counts.\n\nThe key to delivering a seamless customer experience begins by comprehending their behaviours, and predicting future interactions. This is a much more complex process than enforcing polite customer service standards, because it requires an extensive understanding of the customer.\n\nThe most efficient way to gain this understanding is through customer journeys. It allows you to track how a customer interacts with your business by providing detailed insights into their motivations or frustrations throughout each touchpoint. But it is important to remember that these journeys are critical across all personas, not just the customer. This includes patients, citizens, employees, and the end-user.\n\nInstead of assuming how customers interact with your business, journeys provide evidence-based insights - typically through a graph or other visual representation to put the customer perspective into even sharper resolution.\n\nWhether you have 50 customers or 5,000 - this approach lets you see your company from the outside in.\n\nBefore diving head-first into designing customer journeys, consider the following three things:\n\n1. Know your objectives\n\nWhile the overarching aim of customer journey mapping is to better understand how your customer interacts with your business - starting with more specific objectives allows you to ease into the process.\n\nFor example, that might mean revising a current process rather than dismantling it entirely - or focusing on a specific type of customer rather than tackling your entire user-base at once.\n\nSetting yourself narrow objectives within a broader vision will help keep things manageable.\n\n2. Find your key people\n\nCollaboration is your most powerful asset when designing comprehensive customer journey maps.\n\nWhen internal processes undergo significant change, it\u2019s common practice to rely on your C-suite executives for all the answers. However, utilising workers that are closest to your customers will provide first-hand observations of the type of customer-personas you\u2019re dealing with, as well as the most common pain points within existing customer journeys.\n\n3. Test, then test again\n\nFor a truly representative customer journey, you need to hear the facts directly from the source, meaning you must factor in extensive customer research to help define KPIs for continuous improvement.\n\nInterviews, surveys and workshops - even analysing data from your business\u2019 social media accounts - will provide helpful feedback on the various touch points throughout your initial design.\n\nKeep it simple by focusing on the most important elements to include in your journeys, and remember customer experience is a process, rather than an end-game.\n\nCustomer Loyalty\n\nThe rise of disruptors - for example neobanks, ride-sharing companies and coworking startups - have all found a niche solution to modern consumer pain points. On the other hand, we are seeing established organisations scramble to compete. In part, this is due a legacy problem; the belief that past success will translate to future prosperity, often with an emphasis on developing products to entice new customers rather than rewarding their loyal users.\n\nShifting focus from an organisation\u2019s traditional areas of strength, to instead focus on the customer experience can be challenging for even the most agile and responsive businesses. But the fundamental objective of customer-centricity is to gain customers\u2019 loyalty and trust - a commodity that\u2019s becoming more and more rare in today\u2019s volatile marketplaces. In order to build that trust authentically, customer-centric businesses understand that they must provide it too, by investing in understanding the needs and desires of their customers.\n\nNo matter how good a business\u2019 offering is - if it doesn\u2019t have customer loyalty, it won\u2019t survive.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/348106", "author": ["Gero Decker"]}, {"title": "Where Have All the Women Gone?", "text": "April 29, 2019 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe lack of women in leadership roles in tech has become a pervasive problem around the globe. A growing number of enterprises and organizations have been establishing mandates to address the problem. Some are further along that path than others, particularly in North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nEven the most conservative corporations are taking a long, hard, and serious look at gender equality as they face skilled labour shortages and demographic shifts in the workplace. According to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Gender Gap Index, the organization ranks Japan 110th in the world, with women holding only one in 10 leadership positions, making it the worst performer among the G7 industrialized nations.\n\nBut while the spirit is willing, execution can be weak. So, what is the problem?\n\nWhile there is much that can be discussed in terms of the various levels of legislation and corporate mandates, none of those numbers will change significantly if workplaces and practices fail to recruit and retain women talent.\n\nThis is an especially challenging dilemma for the tech sector, where gender inequality at senior levels is even more pronounced than markets such as financial services. According to a 2017 report by the Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, women filled 47 per cent of all jobs in 2015 but held only 24 per cent of STEM jobs. Obviously, this shrinks the available talent pool for senior roles considerably.\n\nA 2017 Canadian survey of more than 900 tech companies found that women account for just five per cent of CEO roles and 13 per cent of executive team positions. More than half of companies have no women executives, only eight per cent of director roles are filled by women, and 73 per cent of firms have no women on their boards at all.\n\nThese numbers are not for lack of trying. Industries and associations are desperately seeking approaches to achieving their diversity at the top initiatives.\n\nIntent By Design\n\nThe answer to this dilemma goes beyond simply hiring more women or announcing gender balance policies. Organizations must design gender equality into the fabric of the business. Only through this \u201cintentional design\u201d approach can you create the kind of organization that women will want to join and where they will want to remain because they know it will afford them the opportunity to grow and contribute and eventually lead and govern.\n\nBut herein lies the problem. There are many blind spots that happen every day that unwittingly reinforce the gender gap within organizations. It could be related to simple things, like wording in job descriptions, or representation at industry events.\n\nFighting Bias\n\nIt can also be complicated. When AI-enabled technologies are developed by a single gender or other specific group, outcomes can be inherently biased. Google\u2019s infamous \u201cthree black teenagers\u201d search is a case in point. Many recruitment tools are also known to eliminate women candidates early in the process because of how the algorithms were developed. Simply put, when you don\u2019t design technologies for a diverse audience, you automatically have bias.\n\nThere are many complexities that go with an intentional design approach. But there are some basics that can help organizations \u2013 and women leaders \u2013 get a clearer picture of where to start, such as:\n\nHost or participate in events that allow women to share and empower others. The power of having women role models is undeniable. If you want to champion other women, put your name forward as a mentor. Beyond networking events, there are tools available that enable mentors to be matched with appropriate people. Tap into talent marketplace services where business leaders can recommend, discover, and connect with highly qualified women. Demand gender balance on speaking panels and conference services. Ensure your recruiting tools don\u2019t have an inherent bias. In 2018, news got out that Amazon had to scrap the recruiting tool they had been building since 2014 because it was built by men and based on predominantly male resume data over a 10-year period. Look to the future. Organizations are now seeing the value of tapping into the next generation of women candidates, sponsoring tech competitions and partnering with educational institutions to help build a larger, more diverse talent pool.\n\nOf course, there is much more to this picture than some simple guidelines. Committing to intentional design requires an honest review of the privileges that are often harboured in processes. It also means understanding the intersectionality of women and creating workplaces that value all aspects of their identity. If you truly want to address the gender gap in senior management, be intentional in everything you do, but more importantly, be bold in your intention to create balanced workplaces.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/331833", "author": ["Jodi Kovitz"]}, {"title": "\u10dd\u10d7\u10ee\u10d8 \u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10e2\u10d8\u10d5\u10d8 \u10d2\u10d6\u10d0 \u10d0\u10d3\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d0\u10d6\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e8\u10d4\u10e1\u10d0\u10ea\u10d5\u10da\u10d4\u10da\u10d0\u10d3", "text": "", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353510", "author": ["\u10ef\u10d4\u10d8\u10e1\u10dd\u10dc \u10e4\u10d0\u10d8\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8"]}, {"title": "''\u10da\u10d4\u10d7\u10dd'' - \u10e1\u10e2\u10e3\u10db\u10d0\u10e0-\u10db\u10d0\u10e1\u10de\u10d8\u10dc\u10eb\u10da\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e3\u10d9\u10d4\u10d7\u10d4\u10e1\u10dd \u10e2\u10e0\u10d0\u10d3\u10d8\u10ea\u10d8\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10d7", "text": "", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353636", "author": ["\u10e1\u10d0\u10da\u10dd\u10db\u10d4 \u10e5\u10e3\u10e8\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8"]}]}, "entrepreneur_marketing": {"link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/marketing", "articles": [{"title": "This Pandemic Is an Opportunity For Investors", "text": "July 21, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nCharles Darwin\u2019s theory of \u2018Survival of the Fittest\u2019 holds relevance today more than ever before especially for businesses and startups. In financial and macro-economy terms, be it the global financial crisis of 2008 or the current COVID-19 pandemic, we, as humans, don\u2019t shy away from finding a silver lining. Angel and seed investments witnessed a growth of 34 per cent during the 2008 crisis, with similar increase in the deal amount, proving that the investors always keep themselves open to opportunities. They are always on a look-out for innovative brains, especially in times when fear is high.\n\nThe air around COVID-19 pandemic in the beginning was that of uncertainty, speculations were rife during the lockdown period, especially with the entrepreneurs. The response was varied with some like Ola, Zomato and Oyo resorted to downsizing, laying off over a thousand employees, to some trending towards frugality pivoting towards survival.\n\nGenerally, an economic downturn isn\u2019t necessarily a degradation for an economy on a micro level. It can also be perceived as a reset with sky as the limit with opportunities, acting as a booster for many hidden ideas as they devise solutions to overcome the crisis. Every business focuses on connecting with the masses, be it education, grocery, entertainment or fitness. Many startups have begun leveraging the power of \u2018online\u2019 to reach the masses and provide them services and products that people would need while being locked inside their houses, along with working remotely. As entrepreneurs leverage the downturn, it\u2019s time investors to back these daring entrepreneurs\u2019 initiatives.\n\nThere is enough evidence in history that some of the most disrupting business ideas have emerged from the most devastating economic downturns (Read Airbnb and Uber). Sectors such as e-commerce, edtech, healthtech, gaming, grocery and OTT are already experiencing a meteoric rise in the number of customers during the lockdown making Indian economy more resilient. A number of startups in these sectors have received funding during the lockdown, as the investors see a huge opportunity in them and believe in their ideas and technology. Milkbasket, a leading grocery startup, recently funded by Inflection Point Ventures (IPV) had almost the same panel of investors in their Series A and B rounds. Similarly, BigBasket raised a bridge funding round from its previous investor during the lockdown at the same valuation as it did last year. This shows how the investors are ready to invest, for they see an opportunity in these sectors. This pandemic might be once in a lifetime opportunity for them, not only for VC funds having dry powder available, but also for angel investors who have the foresightedness to bet on a great business and founding team.\n\nAlso, with falling valuations, most investors look forward to invest particularly during this lockdown.\n\nThough the pandemic offers a significant opportunity for the investors, it\u2019s important for them to be equally confident about their investments. Investment firms need to repose this confidence by sharing the optimistic side of this pandemic. Investor confidence needs to developed by thorough investor education and deeply connected network. Angel investment platforms like IPV ensure extensive due diligence of startups led by industry experts, towards earning the trust of their investors. More importantly, the firms need to proactively utilise this lockdown period towards detailed engagement with the investors. Also, the market has been witnessing a huge addition of angel investors annually. With real estate and stock market not delivering well in the last five years, startup investing has emerged as a lucrative asset class. This new set of investors need to be wisely educated, to make them understand why this is the best time for them to invest.\n\nWhile many VCs are in a wait and watch mode to resume their funding in startups, it\u2019s time that the key investment platforms rather diligently identify startups with high opportunities and fair valuation. During COVID, the investors need to bet on good founder driven startups building their businesses in a cost-controlled environment, so they get liquidity for the next 12-18 months. Though the pandemic has upended many global organizations with huge capital, the Indian startup ecosystem seems to have a grip on the situation now.

It helps you envision your spendings and allocate funds accordingly.\n\nOutdoor all the way\n\nWeddings at home can get cramped up especially if it isn\u2019t in a farmhouse. Always keep in mind to have ample light (sunlight/natural light) and space on your side. If you have a backyard or a terrace then make use of it. Natural light results in beautiful images automatically. A well-lit venue ensures you have good memories so make sure that your ceremony is either in the morning or sunset hours to use the good soft and golden light.\n\nDecor Elements\n\nIt's a good idea to have a professional wedding planner or decorator help you with the budget you have.

Ethics are the morals and principals that govern a person's behaviour. It means to be able to differentiate between what is right or wrong, and what is good or bad. People with robust work ethics perform their work with full dedication. It makes them stand out from the rest who may try to dodge hard work. The one with strong ethics never loses focus from their goals. They put persistent efforts, leading them to produce high-quality work consistently.\n\nIn today\u2019s corporate era, business ethics or code of ethics are buzzwords. The reason behind this is the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) world we are all in. Here information, definitions, directions might not be clear, and employees have to rely on guidelines and their judgments to stay on the right side. Above all, the pressure to succeed in a highly competitive world and taking short cuts or driving short term benefits might take precedence over being morally on the right side, especially if lines are blurred.\n\nAccording to few people ethics can be taught while some say, it depends upon how a person has been raised, if he or she was made to distinguish between being morally right and being ethically wrong. It basically demonstrates that all the ethics courses online are useless. But psychologists today say that ethics consists of knowing what we ought to do, and such knowledge can be taught.\n\nProfessionalism is the conduct, behaviour, and attitude of a person in a work or a corporate environment. Professionalism can, indeed, be taught, and it has been for centuries, but not in the classroom. Instead, it is taught in the hidden curriculum at work, where professional behaviours are recognized and promoted while unprofessional practices get penalised, directly or indirectly, sooner or later.\n\nUnderlying professionalism and ethics are values such as integrity, commitment, sensitivity and respect, and civic sense. Being professional requires ethical behaviour that drives interactions with employees, customers, and leaders. It is based on how someone performs their job, takes decisions, and how their work is perceived in the organisation.\n\nProfessionalism and ethics \u2013 Non-negotiable at work\n\nIn today\u2019s environment, where the COVID pandemic has spiraled the term VUCA into a completely new and unprecedented dimension, professionalism and ethics have become even more essential than ever before.\n\nSuccess\n\nOrganisations require committed professionals who will perform while abiding by the code of ethics, commitment, and resilience. Short term attitude might prove to be detrimental for the organisation and hence will not be welcomed. Therefore, to become long term talent, professionalism, and ethics are crucial. A team member who is extremely intelligent and talented but with poor work ethics will only harm the organisation.\n\nChecking Tool\n\nWorkplace ethics act as a moral compass and provide employees with the guidelines for decision making in situations that appear grey. It\u2019s always better to err on the side of caution than to take a risk. In today\u2019s VUCA world, there are a lot of grey situations. For instance, the present case, where organisations are struggling with cash flows, to maintain employee wellbeing and experience. At this time, their decision-making process and the way execution will exhibit their code of ethics.\n\nOrganisational reputation and brand\n\nAn organisation where employees uphold the highest standards of professionalism and ethics is seen as an employer of choice. But in reality, it is not awards and publications that make a person the best employer. Rather it is the way when you uphold your values in times of crisis and helps the organisation to get through it.\n\nProfitability and productivity\n\nEthics and organisational success go hand in hand. Value-driven companies are always successful in the long run, with a workforce that is committed, engaged, and capable. In today\u2019s crisis, organisations that will persevere, pivot, and innovate to meet the needs of a new normal and engage their employees while doing so will emerge as winners.\n\nBuilding of society\n\nOrganisations are a subunit of society. What we do at work, we carry back home and vice versa. As we abide by professional and ethical standards at work, we bring the same values of commitment, dedication, loyalty, and integrity to our family and society. For example- We visited a store in Delhi a few days back. The guard at the entrance told us to wait as only limited people were allowed inside. We decided to wait, but the lady behind us got impatient and tried to enter the store even though the guard had not given a go-ahead. Witnessing this, my twelve-year kid elucidated the lady about the rules and the importance of maintaining the distance. A little taken aback, she listened and decided to stay back for her safety.\n\nThese are just a few implications of imbibing professionalism and ethics in our day to day interactions, at work, and in our personal dealings. It is also evident, that maintaining a professional and ethical mindset, as individuals and organisations will be vital in emerging as conquerors in the corona crisis.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353631", "author": ["Sonica Aron"]}, {"title": "Millennials and Upskilling: The Changing Role of HR", "text": "July 22, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWith the advent of new technological disruptions in the form of artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, Internet-of-Things, blockchain and cloud, we\u2019re at the cusp of a dramatic shift in the industry. This disruption is likely to have an impact on the job market too. A recent McKinsey Global Institute report titled, Jobs lost, jobs gained: Workforce transitions in a time of automation, predicts that about 14 per cent of the global workforce or about 375 million workers will feel the need to switch their occupational categories by as early as 2030. To stay relevant in the changing industry scenario, they will need to equip themselves with new skills and find ways to completely redefine their career paths.\n\nWhile the McKinsey report presents the global picture, we\u2019re seeing this trend reflected in India as well. As per the Future of Jobs in India report by EY- Nasscom, by 2022 we can expect 9 per cent of the workforce will be deployed in new jobs that do not exist today. Also, 37 per cent of professionals will work in jobs that require radically different skill sets.\n\nIn order to ward off obsolescence, the workforce needs to learn new skills that will soon become mainstream. A World Economic Forum report predicts that almost 54 per cent of all employees will require significant reskilling and upskilling by 2022. Not just that, but about 35 per cent will likely require up to six months of additional training, and about 20 per cent are likely to require even more long-term training.\n\nMillennials in the Workforce\n\nThe other big trend we\u2019re seeing in the entry of millennials into the formal workforce. As India\u2019s huge population of millennials grows up and joins the workforce, we\u2019re starting to see their impact. As per a 2018 report by Deloitte India and the Retailers Association of India, millennials have emerged as the chief wage earners in India with a 47 per cent share in the working-age population. The millennial employees tend to behave differently compared with their predecessors. For instance, a survey by Censuswide revealed that 56 per cent of millennial respondents have job-hopped at least once in the last 16 months; and three times in the last 3-10 years. Interestingly, about 49 per cent of respondents saw job-hopping as an opportunity to learn new skills.\n\nRole of HR\n\nFor HR professionals, the message is clear. Creating the right framework and mechanisms for upskilling of the workforce, especially millennials, needs to be a priority.\n\nFor an organization to stay competitive and thrive in the dynamic new world, building the right skills within the organization is crucial. This requires a two-pronged approach of: first, upskilling existing millennials within the company and second, strategically hiring millennials who have the right skills.\n\nHowever, putting in place an effective learning and development strategy that can equip employees with the right skills isn\u2019t an easy task. An ad-hoc approach that asks employees to simply take a few online courses isn\u2019t the answer.\n\nGiven the pace of change, any rigid course structure that is long drawn and intensive is likely to become obsolete very soon. To be truly effective, course content development needs to take an agile approach, much like the software development process today where product roadmaps are dictated by user analytics.\n\nSuch an approach works particularly well for the millennial population since it puts greater control into the hands of the learner and allows them to adapt the programme such that it is aligned with their aspirations as well as the overall organisational objectives. Also, AI-driven analytics can help incorporate a high level of personalization and elements of gamification to ensure that learners are more motivated and engaged in the learning process.\n\nThe format of training matters too. For instance, a blended approach to learning that balances self-study with interactivity works better than an online-only approach. Our own experience shows that with a well-designed blended learning approach, NPS rates soar over 70 per cent; while course completion rates cross 50 per cent, which is four to five times the prevailing industry statistics.\n\nA \u2018Digital Readiness\u2019 survey conducted by Simplilearn in conjunction with People Matters magazine found that 87 per cent of organizations agreed that digital upskilling is a necessity; while 65 per cent acknowledged that they lacked resources and a vividly defined roadmap.\n\nBy all accounts, the fourth industrial revolution will favour those with strong digital skills. Given this, HR has a critical role to play in ensuring that they are placing an adequate focus on designing effective programsme that are designed to help millennials upskill themselves such that they are well-equipped to deliver value in the era of the fourth industrial revolution.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353630", "author": ["Kashyap Dalal"]}, {"title": "iPhone 12 Leaks: A Powerhorse That Will Leave You Excited", "text": "July 22, 2020 4 min read\n\nThe rumours of the iPhone 12 are making users pretty exciting about the launch.\n\nTo start with, it\u2019s being said that iPhone 12 will destroy the iPhone 11. But are the latest feature that great?\n\nWe had already told you that Apple is planning to slash down its prices, and will also come with a fast power charging, among more features.\n\nFrom massive camera upgrades to brand new size, exciting rumours about the upcoming iPhone 12 are making rounds.\n\nTo say the least, iPhone 12 will be a powerhorse with amazing configurations.\n\n\n\niPhone 12 - Meet the Powerhorse\n\nThe latest model will come with the power adapter charging capacity of 20W, which will be a great upgrade from the iPhone 11 models. If this happens it will boost the battery life by 10-12 per cent.\n\nWhile we all have been excited about the price slash, now we also have a better idea of why Apple will be charging less. A piece of news that might disappoint many. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo revealed that Apple will not be including a fast 20W charger in the box with the iPhone 12.\n\nIt is being said that Apple's 20W power adapter will be an optional accessory and there are huge changes that the company will also end production of both 5W and 18W power adapters.\n\nThe latest leak brings in good news for camera lovers. While the iPhone 11 camera is already loved by people, iPhone 12 will have A14 chip, a powerhorse that could change the entire dynamics of pervious iPhones (iPhone 11 that comes with A13). This addition will boost the speed and battery life (despite it having a smaller battery than iPhone 11) both at the same time, something users would thoroughly enjoy.\n\nAs per PhoneArea, iPhone 11 has A13 chip that uses 7 nanometer (7nm) process, while A15 will use a 5-nanometer (5nm) process. This will not only increase the speed by up to 15 per cent but also consume less power by up to 30 per cent. If you are an Apple user, you would understand what this modification means to the users,\n\nCheapest Flagship iPhone\n\nIt is also being said iPhone 12 will be one of the most affordable flagship phones with a 5.4 inch Super Retina OLED display, making it the smallest phone by them to date. Having such a processor in a tiny device already makes it a power-piece all set to compete in the smartphone market.\n\nIf the leaks are true, the features will lead to a powerful photo processor, making it a great camera phone in the market as well.\n\niPhone 12 Series\n\nMoving on to the models iPhone 12 Max comes with a 6.1-inch screen and iPhone 12 Pro with 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR with ProMotion along with 6GB RAM. The Pro models will have 120Hz high refresh-rate displays and a bigger screen will only led to draining a lot more energy. However, a bigger battery across the iPhone 12 models could make it a winner.\n\nThe phone will be available in three internal storage variants of 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. The latest model will be combined with powerful chips in the form of the A14 Bionic.\n\nTalking about the price point, this model might be super cheap than expected. As per leaker Omega Leaks tweet, iPhone 12- 4G \u2014 might be priced at $549 and iPhone 12 Max 4G would be $649.\n\nNo Charger or EarPods\n\nWhile we all have been excited about the price slash, Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo revealed that Apple will not be including a fast 20W charger in the box with the iPhone 12.\n\nIt is being said that Apple's 20W power adapter will be an optional accessory and there are huge changes that the company will also end production of both 5W and 18W power adapters.\n\nAR- LiDar Scanner\n\nAnother great rumour - this monster chip will support the LiDAR scanner, which is already available in iPad Pro. This feature might be available in iPhone 12 Pro models. This move will certainly transform the gadgets AR capabilities.\n\nThe latest developments will make the iPhone 12 beat its predecessor in terms of looks, camera, speed, power, new chip, making it a powerful device that one would love to own.\n\nAlso Read:\n\niPhone 12 Leaks: It's Everything We Have Been Waiting For\n\niPhone 12 Leaks: Bad News for Apple Consumers", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353625", "author": ["Priyadarshini Patwa"]}, {"title": "Battery Swapping-Is It a Success In India?", "text": "July 21, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nAs we set out towards a \u2018greener environment\u2019, the emergence of electrically powered vehicles are more evident than ever before. Discussions on electric vehicles (EVs) will inevitably gravitate towards the development of EV infrastructure. In all instances, the conversation revolves around the deployment of EV charging points as a lack of charging infrastructure is hindering the expansion of EVs. If India envisions to break out on the electric mobility front in the coming years, it is crucial to create an EV charging ecosystem alongside.\n\nThe government has been exploring different charging models keeping in mind the local conditions to kick-start faster deployment of EVs. Thus, to build India's electric car industry, the government will also have to recognize \u2018battery swapping\u2019 as a viable alternative to a vehicle's direct charging.\n\nA recent report suggests that India's EV battery swapping market is projected to reach $6.1 million by 2030, registering 31.3 per cent growth during 2020-2030.\n\nThe need for private vehicles will increase given the new normal, where maintaining social distancing may be a norm. The need for more lightweight, yet sturdy structures running on superior quality tires will continue the pace because driven by consumer demand, the industry will push EV two-wheelers, cars in their view to make a sustainable mode of commuting, and because the companies still deploy electric fleet.\n\nTwo and three-wheelers dominate the Indian auto market, and over 80 per cent of total vehicles in India comprise two-wheelers. Battery swapping technology may witness a faster adoption in the electric two-wheeler and three-wheeler mobility segment. In this segment (small vehicle), battery swapping technology presents a leapfrogging opportunity for India's EV dreams as it offers cost-effectiveness for consumers and several comparative advantages over dedicated charging infrastructure and fossil-fuel practices in the ease of use.\n\nThe key here is to form the transition more accessible for users by finding a replacement for the prevailing petrol pump. While the industry is watching charging stations, battery swapping should is an alternate and promising charging option for two-wheelers and three-wheelers. Many manufacturers have begun with a singular solution. They're in the process of making an ecosystem of swappable battery stations in association with service providers.\n\nBenefits of Battery Swapping\n\nFirst, swapping a battery takes only a couple of minutes, which eliminates drivers' wait time. Conventional fast and slow charging could take anywhere from 2-6 hours, respectively, for a fully charged vehicle. Taking cues from somewhat of an in-depth cousin of EVs, the CNG vehicles where refueling takes a minimum of 10-20 minutes waiting in line, EV charging experience would be ten times as inconvenient and equally undesirable. This time is precious, especially for a commercial vehicle driver. Thus, a 90-second battery swap makes excellent sense in keeping the car ready-to-use without wasting time. It will also reduce the dimensions of batteries in vehicles and offer an increased available run time.\n\nSecond, within the entire EV value chain, charging infrastructure is a vital enabler. Based on surveys by think tanks, the limited availability of charging infrastructure, including a scarcity of adequate business and financing models, is considered one of the most critical obstacles to widespread EV adoption by customers who suffer from range anxiety.\n\nFinally, the high upfront cost of EVs is due to the high price of the battery pack, which constitutes 40-60 per cent of the value of an EV. In the case of battery swapping, the battery packs are often separated from the vehicle and owned by energy operators. Therefore the end-user will only need to pay whenever they swap the used battery with a charged one instantly.\n\nSubsidizing the battery cost will help promote faster adoption of EVs in India. By offering financial incentives for manufacturing batteries as against the entire EV, the manufacturing of batteries too would get accelerated; technology and innovation would flourish; economies of scale would be achieved, and batteries would be both domestically produced and affordable. Battery swapping technology will tackle the challenge of the lack of common battery standards across multiple automakers and significantly lower upfront costs for two and three-wheelers in the long-run.\n\nWith the above benefits taken into consideration, the possibilities for mass-scale swappable EV battery packs are endless. The battery swapping infrastructure doesn't need any investment from the local power distribution companies and can also rely on a low current carrying capacity.\n\nWith the rapid adoption of EVs in India, there will be a need for constant innovation in the electric car industry to accommodate consumer demand. The EV market is bound to catalyze new business models, including battery swapping technology and battery charging, paving the way for economic growth and job creation.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353581", "author": ["Akhil Aryan"]}, {"title": "World Has Evolved for Young Entrepreneurs Due To the Power of Internet: Kavin Bharti Mittal", "text": "July 21, 2020 3 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nDespite coming from a family which owns one of the largest businesses in India, Kavin Bharti Mittal decided to start his own venture.

Mitch McConnell opened the door earlier this month for another stimulus check for Americans earning below $40,000 a year. That step, however, could leave out 20 million people.\n\nA bill from Sen. Marco Rubio introduced last month would give mixed-status families with unauthorized immigrants $1,200 stimulus checks.\n\nUnder the Cares Act, individuals earning under $75,000 a year ($150,000 for couples) got checks of $1,200, plus an extra $500 for dependent children. Payments phased out at $99,000 for single filers and $198,000 for couples.\n\nBy the beginning of June, over 159 million Americans had received direct payments, per the IRS.\n\nAn extension of boosted unemployment payments is also under consideration\n\nImage credit: Reuters\n\nDemocrats are seeking to extend the $600 federal boost to weekly unemployment benefits \u2014 set to expire on July 25 for 49 states and July 26 for New York \u2014 through January.\n\nBut many Republicans have argued that the boost should be phased out or the amount lowered so workers don't find it more lucrative to earn from the government than a job.\n\nThe White House is signaling it could extend the payments at a lower amount, such as $200 and $400 a week, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that five out of every six recipients would get more money from the government than from their previous employer if the supplement were extended through the end of the year.\n\nUnemployment, though, is expected to remain in or near double digits for much of the year, according to the CBO and the Federal Reserve.\n\nA group of top bipartisan economists recently called on Congress to implement a federal boost of up to $400 per week past July, tied to the economic health of individual states.\n\nLawmakers are proposing hazard pay to give essential workers a financial boost\n\nImage credit: Jeffrey Greenberg/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nIn the HEROES Act passed in May, House Democrats included $200 billion in hazard pay for essential workers such as grocery store employees. That measure would supplement an extra $13 an hour on top of regular wages for those workers.\n\nSenate Democrats also released a proposal \u2014 known as the \"Heroes Fund\" \u2014 to provide up to $25,000 per person for a broad range of essential workers, including delivery drivers.\n\nSome congressional Republicans moved in that direction too. GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah also unveiled a plan to provide additional money for essential workers. It would ramp up pay for qualifying workers earning less than $50,000 a year by $12 an hour for three months.\n\nRepublicans are pushing for a \"back to work\" bonus of up to $1,200\n\nImage credit: Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nSeveral Republicans have rolled out proposals for a hiring bonus, arguing that it would be effective in getting people off unemployment rolls and back to work.\n\nRep. Kevin Brady introduced a plan for a $1,200 bonus, which is equivalent to a jobless person collecting two weeks of expanded unemployment benefits.\n\nAnother bill from Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio would put the bonus at $450 a week for up to six weeks.\n\n\"The $600 was necessary, in my view, to get us started in this, but now we have a situation where the economy is starting to reopen, people are looking for workers,\" Portman said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing earlier this month.\n\nTrump has repeatedly advocated for a payroll tax cut, which would reduce taxes paid by workers and possibly employers depending on its design\n\nImage credit: EUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nTrump called for a payroll tax cut back in March as the economy cratered due to the pandemic. In recent days, the president doubled down on the measure and indicated he may not sign a package that doesn't contain it.\n\n\"It's been proven to be successful and it's a big saving for the people\" Trump said on Monday, calling the tax break \"very important\" to him.\n\nPayroll taxes are the 7.65% of earnings taken out of employee paychecks and another 7.65% that's levied on employers to finance the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The idea is that trimming or doing away with the tax for workers would put more money into their paychecks.\n\nBut congressional Republicans have expressed skepticism on its ability to boost the economy, suggesting that it may not make it into the final spending package negotiated with Democrats who oppose it.\n\n\"I think when a person has a check in his hand... I think that's going to do more economic good than if we dribble out $30 every paycheck,\" Senate Finance Chair Chuck Grassley said on Monday afternoon.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353602", "author": ["Joseph Zeballos-Roig"]}, {"title": "Digit Insurance, CredR Join Hands to Offer Health Insurance to Owners of Used Two-wheeler Vehicles", "text": "July 21, 2020 2 min read\n\nCredR, the omnichannel platform for to buy and sell used two-wheeler vehicles, has tied up with digit Insurance to offer health insurance cover second hand vehicle owners.\n\nUnder this partnership, CredR customers will be offered affordable accidental insurance cover or loss of pay arising out of road accidents.\n\nThe user will pay a premium of INR 525, inclusive of GST, in order to avail the benefit of INR 5,000 per week or actual weekly salary, whichever is lower, up to 100 weeks.

In other words, is it still a struggle for a woman to succeed in the world of business, an environment that many still consider to be male-dominated?\n\nAs is often the case with big questions, the answer is complicated. We've made positive progress in recent times when it comes to equality in the workplace. Still, the adversaries and struggles a woman has to contend with, particularly while growing a startup, cannot be underestimated. Having said that, I'm a firm believer in the adage that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\n\nAn entrepreneur of any gender needs a determined belief in what they're doing and a cast-iron resolve to get things done if they're to succeed in a highly competitive marketplace. Unfortunately, the evidence still seems to indicate that if you're a female, you need that little extra something to break through the proverbial glass ceiling.\n\nHere's a list of 10 female entrepreneurs, in no particular order of accomplishment, who have done exactly that, providing a template of inspiration to us all.\n\nRelated: Get to Know the Female Entrepreneurs Who Are Reshaping the Business World\n\nArleen Ouzounian\n\nBeing an entrepreneur is not everyone's cup of tea, but it certainly is Arleen Ouzounian's. The woman behind Nazani Tea is ruffling feathers in the centuries-old tea and herbal-infusion industry, and has witnessed a 389 percent jump in quarter-to-date sales compared to 2019. Ouzonian and her company pride themselves on quality, transparency, ethical sourcing and sustainability.\n\nOuzonian shares that the thickest glass ceiling is one women often create for themselves, explaining, \"There will always be moments of self-doubt and back-to-back days where you feel you're constantly fighting fires, but with perseverance and sheer determination the pieces of the puzzle will fall into place.\"\n\nHelen Georgio\n\nThe brains behind Buzz Talent, Buzz Mode and Buzz Celebrity believes that being an entrepreneur should be about the impact you leave on the society and improving peoples lives for the better. Her talent-management agency has not only scaled significantly over the last three years and doubled the team, but it has also helped countless young hopefuls break into their chosen fields.\n\nHelen shares that the last three months forced her think outside the box. During these testing times, she's created other channels of income for her clients, which resulted in a 68 percent increase in revenue in this quarter as compared to the same one last year.\n\nLaura K. Inamedinova\n\nThis PR innovator and founder of LKI Consulting is a name to reckon with when it comes to communications. Inamedinova takes pride in securing yearly communications-advisory contracts with several billion-dollar companies to spearhead their communication strategies. Laura states, \"Entrepreneurship is a life philosophy where you allow yourself to explore different possibilities while being agile and reactive to new opportunities that arise.\"\n\nNor does she believe that genders play any role in entrepreneurial success, adding, \"What does play instead are personality traits and attitude towards business, and overcoming the inner barriers that hold women back from making it big. Young women should accept their fears and push fiercely towards their goals. Yes, it's going to be hard. You will feel stressed and anxious, but just keep going.\"\n\nGrace Huang\n\nThe glass ceiling gets even thicker when you are a minority. Grace Huang, the young CEO behind GH HAUS, an innovative fashion brand, knows this all too well. \"Being a minority entrepreneur, it is hard to gain the same level of trust and respect as men,\" she says. \"When you pitch your plan to investors, be confident and persistent in showing who you really are and what defines you as a businesswoman.\"\n\nAt GH HAUS, Huang collaborates with artists from across the globe and creates designs for her clients that aim to turn wardrobes into nothing short of art. And she is creating a sustainable ecosystem for her artist friends that offers emotional and financial support.\n\nGabrielle Breton\n\nGabrielle Breton is a digital marketing powerhouse and CEO of House of Socials. \"I think entrepreneurship has a deep correlation with being a visionary,\" she says. \"It's being a forward thinker at all times.\"\n\nBreton launched her agency amidst the pandemic and made it a huge success. From acquiring more than 25 new clients, to gaining 120,000-plus followers for them, the business has grown exponentially. \"Claim your power,\" she encourages. \"Don't let fear prevent you from making it big.\"\n\nMary Lou Marinas\n\nMary Lou Marinas, a founding partner of Larson Consulting, Inc. believes that \"entrepreneurialism is about having a profound desire for freedom and being able to pursue that freedom is worth the grunt stemming from the unforeseen risks.\"\n\nMarinas elaborates, \"Previously while working inter-departmentally at the headquarters of a nationally renowned restaurant chain, I learned that my professional enthusiasm rested in growing and pushing the boundaries of what a business could be, but my science-focused college degrees prevented me from breaking the glass ceiling. That's when I decided to leave that job and enrolled for an MBA at Chicago Booth.\"\n\nThat move, in turn, helped her transition into independent business consulting. And despite recent macro-economic disruptions, digital sales for her business grew by 180 percent in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nDr. Heidi Stevenson\n\nDr. Stevenson is an educator-entrepreneur who believes that entrepreneurship is something that starts as a hobby and morphs into a business. Her advice to would-be-entrepreneurs is to do something you love, and the money will come. Her mantra is never to stop learning.\n\nWhen she does not have her teaching hat on, the founder of Trendy with a Passport can be seen showing essential hacks on how to travel the world and look like a million bucks on a budget. \"Trendy with a Passport started as a hobby and has grown into a five-figure business,\" she says. \"Going into the beginning of the year, I was partnering with a few brands a week and now am contacted by 20-40 per week.\"\n\nHansni Thadhani\n\nHansni Thadhani, the founder of outdoor surfboard shower company Strand Boards, says, \"Being in plumbing and surfing, two male-dominated industries, people are often surprised that I'm the founder, but I'm proud to be a woman pioneering a one-of-a-kind product and owning my space.\"\n\nThe mompreneur believes that, \"Ultimately, it is harder to succeed as a woman entrepreneur, but it's getting easier. As we're empowered, and companies see the potential of women at the helm, doors open for all of us. I encourage every business person, gender aside, to do their research, due diligence, network and recognize that building a business is going to take blood, sweat and tears. You will make mistakes, but that does not mean you're incapable. It means you're human, which should be a relief.\"\n\nErika Helenn Coelho Silva El Haje\n\nFounder and CEO of Prime Home Care, Erika Helenn, shares that the biggest challenge she had to overcome was the accumulation of different functions and being available all the time. \"Unfortunately, when it comes to women, the journey will be at least double,\" she says. \"All of us, entrepreneurial women, accumulate different functions in our homes and do not receive the same encouragement and support from society.\n\nShe reveals that, upon launching her company, she had prepared a three-year growth plan. The strategic actions adopted were based on studies in the reports using business intelligence and reliable data. \"The goal was reached every year,\" she reports. \"And the company is currently the largest in the number of highly complex patients with an innovative operational structure.\"\n\nJoy Adowaa Buolamwini\n\nThis founder of Algorithmic Justice League is the woman who has unmasked racial and gender bias in AI services like facial recognition. As a minority, Buolamwini has not only broken the glass ceiling by challenging systems that have reinforced racial bias, but she's leading the charge by getting tech companies like Microsoft, IBM and Amazon to stop providing general-purpose facial-recognition technologies and commit at least $1 million each towards ending ingrained bigotry in advanced technologies.\n\nRelated: Spanx Founder Sara Blakely's Guide to Surviving Anything\n\nHopefully, these 10 phenomenal women will serve as testament that talent, drive and vision needn't know any superficial boundaries.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/352948", "author": ["Simonetta Lein"]}, {"title": "The Entrepreneur's Playbook Always Shifts", "text": "July 12, 2020 2 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nJonathan Boos is the founder of W\u00fcrkin Stiffs, which sells shirt collar stays with embedded magnets.

We\u2019ve heard the romanticized stories about exactly that. In my recent TEDx, I talked about how actress Charlize Theron was upset at a bank when she first moved to Hollywood from Johannesburg because she couldn\u2019t access her bank to withdraw money. Hollywood manager John Crosby happened to be in the bank at the same time. He saw her throw her fit and signed her on the spot.\n\nOr, equally as serendipitous: Mandy Moore was working on her music at a studio in Orlando when she was 13, and a FedEx delivery man overhead her singing. He sent her record to his friend at Epic Records, and that\u2019s how she got her start.\n\nBut here\u2019s the issue with stories like these: We hear them enough that we begin to believe that someone is coming to \"save\" us \u2014 whether it be a Hollywood manager who\u2019s at our bank or a FedEx delivery man who overhears our talent. It makes it easy to put our dream in our back pocket and believe that the right opportunity will fall out of the sky with fairy dust. This is a dangerous way of thinking, because it promotes complacency in our own lives when really, we need to be out there starting our dream careers on our own.\n\nRelated: 6 Personal Fears Holding You Back From Your Dream Career\n\nSo, how does one do this? It comes down to vision, traction and a content creation plan that feeds into both. With the right audience, you don\u2019t need that TV network, record deal or magic connection to start pursuing the career of your dreams. You can start on your own.\n\nShow off what you can do on your own terms\n\nRather than waiting for that audition or meeting that may never come, how can you show what you can do now, with the platforms you have available to you? My own dream career is to be a TV show host. When I was seeking advice from Joya Dass, a long time TV anchor and the founder of LadyDrinks, she told me it\u2019s all about putting out content now that\u2019s reflective of your talents and abilities.\n\n\u201cNowadays, networks come to you if you have the audience and you\u2019re already doing what you would be doing on their show,\u201d she told me. So, if you can build the audience on your own, you\u2019ll have plenty of evidence that you have a skill set or talent in your dream career and that you\u2019re an asset that employers should want.\n\nRelated: The 9-Step Quick Guide to Rehabbing Your Career\n\nThis is in accordance with one of my favorite quotes: \u201cBe so good they can\u2019t ignore you.\u201d Jessie James Decker, country music singer and fashion designer, shared with Lori Greiner on the \u201cBed Talks with Lori\u201d Live series that the first thing you should do if you're a singer is to post videos of yourself singing. If you\u2019re good, people will pay attention, follow you and share your page with others. We so often think that we first need to be \u201cgiven the microphone\u201d or the platform to show what we can do, but it begins with taking the initiative on our own and believing in our talents enough to trust that sharing them will get us somewhere.\n\nBuild your audience backwards\n\nIt's easy to say \"just get started,\" but it\u2019s also key to be strategic with our efforts. Sunny Lenarduzzi is a social media marketing expert who has almost half a million subscribers. When I asked her for her best advice on building an audience for your dream career, she said to work backwards. \u201cThe most successful channels and clients I've worked with know exactly who they are speaking to and exactly what they're trying to achieve before they ever record a single video. I emphasize that you need to research before you record,\u201d she told me.\n\n\u201cLook at mentors and influencers who have the exact audience you are looking to attract, and study what pieces of content are getting the most engagement from their audience. That will help inform the kind of content you create,\u201d she says.\n\nRelated: How to Turn Your Passion Into Your Dream Job\n\nEssentially, it comes down to knowing what it is you want to say or do, then identifying the audience that most wants to hear it or engage with it. Then, don\u2019t stray from that message or that type of content as you begin to build your audience. I experienced explosive growth on my TikTok channel (quadrupling my following from 10,000 to over 40,000 in just over a month) once I focused solely on my niche, which is \u201ccreating your dream life.\u201d By building my audience backwards, my efforts were more fruitful.\n\nIt\u2019s admittedly daunting to go after your dream career and show up to an (initially) small audience day after day. But ultimately, if it\u2019s truly your dream career, you\u2019ll want to do the heart of the work even if no one sees or hears it. In today\u2019s social media-oriented world, we have the power to make the most of our platforms rather than waiting to be discovered.

Here Are Common Pitfalls to Avoid", "text": "July 10, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nStarting an online business requires some planning. An entrepreneur needs to gauge demand, understand how SEO and digital ads work and know how to acquire customers cost-efficiently. If the formula works, the business can scale rapidly. As stated in the \u201cEnabling Digital Entrepreneurs\u201d report by World Bank Group, \u201cmany digital entrepreneurs are \u2018born global\u2019 and have the ability to grow and scale across borders very quickly.\u201d\n\nOnline spending has skyrocketed in recent years, and continued growth is likely as people continue to stay home, which \"creates huge opportunities for internet stores,\u201d says Mathieu Jang in an interview. He\u2019s the co-founder of Affiliate Institute, a Las Vegas-based training firm that helps members grow revenue online.\n\nJang created a 12-week accelerator program that optimizes students\u2019 affiliate-marketing practices. Aside from the technical aspects of ecommerce, he says it\u2019s critical to have the proper mindset and remove notions of a personal limitation: \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t happen to successful marketers. Top performers happen to the world.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., ecommerce now represents 16 percent of all retail sales, according to the Commerce Department. And Amazon.com accounts for more than one-third of ecommerce. Thus, a small business can potentially reach a massive audience. However, there are pitfalls to avoid.\n\nRelated: 3 Things You Need to Know Before Starting a Delivery Service Business\n\n1. Not understanding your target customer\n\nYou can burn plenty of cash by running ineffective ads. Bad marketing campaigns increase the cost of acquiring a customer, which is a crucial metric for a digital venture. There\u2019s much noise on social and the web, which can confuse how novices approach campaigns. You need to truly understand the target audience in order to optimize ads. That means being effective with location, interests, design, calls to action and other factors that increase conversions and lower customer-acquisition costs.\n\nThe sales volume for merchandise is huge. For example, the online market for apparel, footwear and accessories will hit $4 trillion this year. Shopping on the web has also increased demand for online services like SEO, website building, graphic design and advertising. A high level of understanding means you\u2019ve properly identified a niche. By knowing who\u2019ll buy and who won\u2019t, you can optimize a website\u2019s content based on that niche, putting you in a better position to create the appropriate landing pages, newsletters, brochures and social posts to attract relevant traffic. When you publish better content, you\u2019ll improve inbound marketing metrics, as well as increase user engagement.\n\nOwners of physical storefronts had it easier because a target consumer was often someone who lived nearby or an adjacent town, but online obviously has no geographic boundaries. It helps to create a digital persona of who you\u2019re targeting. What does your ideal shopper look and behave like? What style of clothing or shoes are they seeking? Which features matter most? You may be able to find profiling tools on social platforms that help to create target profiles. A business owner cannot successfully carve out a niche without identifying their customers.\n\n2. Working as a lone wolf\n\nIt helps greatly to already possess knowledge of online practices like SEO, ads, ecommerce, email campaigns and social media best practices, but there can be frustrating blind spots. You may be good at running Facebook ads but flounder at writing landing pages. Or you may have high open rates on email campaigns but suffer low purchase conversions. Scott Smith, the founder of 7 Figure Surfer, said in a recent phone call, \u201cDuring my six years working online, I often had to figure it out myself. I started from scratch and spent thousands of dollars in the process.\u201d\n\nSmith overcame these hurdles by getting a few mentors who showed solutions, as well as provided encouragement. A seasoned veteran can quickly teach entrepreneurs what works and what doesn\u2019t, saving them headaches, time and money. It\u2019s a good idea to attend conferences, meet-ups and networking events to exchange contact info with gurus. Leveraging other people\u2019s expertise (in areas where you are weak) boosts the efficacy of campaigns. When setting up an ecommerce venture, small tweaks can pay big dividends.\n\n3. Not outsourcing or using automation tools\n\nOutsourcing enables business owners to cost-effectively tap the skills of independent contractors, streamlining the business because they\u2019re better at specific tasks than you are. Virtual assistants free up time so you can focus on acquiring customers and providing after-purchase support. Hiring a video producer to create a popular TikTok video is a more effective use of time and budget than doing it yourself.\n\nOr use a tool that\u2019s saving business owners time. Neuro.net, the automation tool, acts as the outsourced call center for retail customers to get support from virtual agents in even complex conversations. And according to the company, it simulates human emotions so well that 99 percent of people don\u2019t know they\u2019re talking to a robot agent. Now that\u2019s a bold claim for an automation tool, but data-processing company Powerry clearly believes it, given their recent $5.3 million dollar investment in Neuro.net. Nevertheless, it\u2019s an affordable option for business owners who can\u2019t quite afford full-time customer-support agents at their current growth stage.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely important that business owners spend their limited time on activities that are crucial for success. Non-essential tasks should be delegated to others. An online business can reach global audiences and scale rapidly. Know your target audience, network with experts in a similar niche and build a team infrastructure that can scale your venture.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/352655", "author": ["Sarah Austin"]}, {"title": "4 Principles to Sell Your Business From Steve Little, the Mergers and Acquisitions Master Who Always Gets More", "text": "July 21, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIf you own a business that produces between $5 million and $100 million every year, what is your business worth?

One of Little\u2019s big principles is \u201cBusinesses are sold, not bought.\u201d What does that mean exactly, and why is it so important to you and your business?\n\nThe best way to illustrate this principle is with a story:\n\n\"Before he died, a father said to his son; \u201cHere is a watch that your grandfather gave me. It is almost 200 years old. Before I give it to you, go to the jewelry store downtown. Tell them that I want to sell it, and see how much they offer you.\"\n\nThe son went to the jewelry store, came back to his father, and said, \"They offered me $150 because it's so old.\"\n\nThe father said, \u201cGo to the pawnshop and ask them.\"\n\nThe son went to the pawnshop, came back to his father, and said, \"The pawnshop offered $10 because it looks so worn.\"\n\nThe father asked his son to go to the museum and show them the watch.\n\nHe went to the museum, came back, and said to his father, \u201cThe curator offered $500,000 for this very rare piece to be included in their precious antique collections.\"\n\nRelated: Keep These 4 Things in Mind Before Selling Your Small Business\n\nThe father said, \u201cI wanted to let you know that the right place values you in the right way. Don't find yourself in the wrong place and get angry if you are not valued. Those that know your value are those who appreciate you. Don't stay in a place where nobody sees your value.\"\n\nKnow your worth.\n\nThe moral of the story is that the right people will value you for who you are and what you have. Don't spend time with people who don't value you. Find the ones that do.\n\nOne of the reasons Little\u2019s past clients consistently say that he\u2019s \u201cthe guy who gets more\u201d is because of his industry longevity. He has a massive Rolodex and system that consistently produces results, informed by a list of 24 Value Drivers and four Key Principles.\n\nThe Value Drivers are critical areas of focus Little uses to increase the value of a business in 6-18 months. The Four Key Principles are disciplined rules and mindsets every business owner needs to consistently produce predictable results that lead to a business sale.\n\nPrinciple One\n\nThere's always a risk-value equation. The higher the risk of ownership, the lower the value of the company; the lower the risk of ownership, the higher the value of the company. Anything you do that reduces risk increases value.\n\nPrinciple Two\n\nValuation does not equal transaction value. All business owners are operating on the understanding that a valuation represents the actual value of their business. It's not -- and it's essential to understand the difference between your business\u2019 valuation and the transaction value of your company. The transaction value is what the right buyer will pay for the business at the right time. If it were just revenue and earnings, you couldn't explain companies like Snapchat, Twitter, and so many other startups with limited or no revenue and earnings that are worth billions.\n\nRelated: 3 Tips to Speed Up Selling Your Business\n\nPrinciple Three\n\nBusinesses are sold, not bought. For every business, at any time, there are multiple potential buyers. Each buyer will value your business uniquely. It's usually based on a factor that's related to how much more valuable their business will be after acquiring your business. It's important to understand what they value most so that you're positioned properly, as the watch story reinforces.\n\nPrinciple Four\n\nThe exit strategy is not about the exit, it\u2019s about the strategy. You can't possibly know what your business is worth or where you're going to invest your time and money to make it worth more if you don't know who would buy you, why they would buy you, and what they value most.\n\nThese Four Principles are guiding concepts for you to build a business of great value.\n\nLittle adds that at the end of the day, is just like selling anything else. It really comes down to something quite simple: people talking to people.\n\nWhen he gets started with a new client, he wants to understand the person: their aspirations, what they want to accomplish in life, their intentions, their goals, and their objectives. What\u2019s going to make them happy? He then works to design a strategy or plan that delivers that to them.

Adding digital components like a website, mobile app or electronic payment processing didn't necessarily mean you'd undergone a complete digital transformation.\n\nThe current health crisis has changed the business community with guidelines and mandates on remote work and social distancing. Even if you\u2019re fortunate enough to continue operating, this radical change may mean it\u2019s time to take a deep dive into a digital transformation, rather than just baby steps.\n\nHere's why you need to change now, and how to do so on a lean budget.\n\nRelated: How to Reward Employees in Uncertain Times\n\nCrumbling legacy systems and paper processes\n\nNot every business is adequately handling the volume that many financial institutions and state and federal organizations are currently experiencing for loan and unemployment processing. These are prime examples of the insufficiencies of legacy systems buckling under the pressure of increased demand. Healthcare and insurance systems are also struggling in this new environment.\n\nAccounting\n\nOn a smaller scale, businesses and startups are also finding it difficult to continue using manual accounting systems that involve paper processes. For example, the new environment makes it difficult to process paper paychecks unless an employee can remotely access the payroll and accounting software as well as print checks. They must also mail all those checks and hope that their employees can somehow deposit them all while complying with shelter-in-place rules.\n\nPayments\n\nPerhaps your business can stay open but you primarily dealt in cash, in-store credit or debit card payments. It\u2019s difficult to continue serving customers without migrating to a digital ordering and payment process. While you might be able to incorporate curbside pickups, customers may not accept this option. If so, they\u2019ll go to a different business that lets them use an order and payment app.\n\nAdding more digital solutions can help sustain your business during these uncertain times as well as maintain revenue and keep productive work flowing.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways to Determine If Now Is the Right Time to Launch Your Business\n\nDiscounted and free digital solutions\n\nCost may have been a factor in your earlier decision to delay a digital transformation. However, many companies see the current health crisis as an opportunity to help out potential customers and simultaneously attract a wider audience for their digital solutions. Many companies are offering their digital tools, apps and platforms for free or at a vastly reduced price.\n\nThere\u2019s a digital solution for every size and type of business, and these potential solutions are worth considering now. For example, companies like 1Password, which make it easy to store passwords digitally, are providing six months of access for free. Cisco Webex, which provides video conferencing capability for webinars and meetings, will extend a 90-day license to businesses whether or not they\u2019re current customers. And many LogMeIn products are available for free to companies for three months through Emergency Remote Work Kits.\n\nAvailable products cover everything from collaboration and communication to HR and financial software tools, in addition to security and remote access solutions. You\u2019ll find numerous lists published online to help you assess your options.\n\nTesting capability\n\nBack when it was business as usual, you might have hesitated to implement new tools in case something went wrong or downtime diminished your customer experience. During the health crisis, however, you can grab this opportunity to test various digital tools and take the digital plunge.\n\nRelated: What You Can Learn From Freelancers Right Now\n\nMany tools and platforms offer trial periods so that you can assess their solutions. You can see what works well and will integrate into your current systems to meet your specific business needs. If you are still open for business, both customers and employees will probably happily try the solutions you\u2019re testing.\n\nFor example, before the shelter-in-place guidelines, many customers had no experience using DoorDash or Instacart for restaurant meals and groceries. Now, however, these digital tools are becoming essential parts of daily life. It\u2019s a great time to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, and to get feedback from customers and employees about what works well for them. By the time a more normal business environment returns, you\u2019ll be ready with digital tools that are proven to work for your business.\n\nA willing remote workforce\n\nPrior to the ongoing health crisis, some team members might have pushed back on making radical changes to existing company . Given the new work environment, your remote workforce is likely in the right frame of mind to try new systems and processes.

As the pandemic continues, the long-term implications of these behavioral shifts are being discussed.\n\nThe financial services sector is treading unknown waters. A sharp decline in branch visits and an exponential jump in virtual interactions have thrust the digital capabilities and customer experiences of banks and insurers under a glaring spotlight. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended contactless payments versus cash, as a way to limit the spread of the virus that may stick on paper currency.

The dairy industry was no different. Even after the government's clarification that lockdown will have no impact on essential services, in the initial days, the dairy tech players did struggle to operate.\n\n\u201cWe deploy a lot of hardware across the supply chain. So we had to send our teams on the ground to check these devices. However, in the initial few days, our teams took some time to reach the ground as police did not let them pass,\" said Ranjith Mukundan, co-founder and CEO, Stellapps Technologies.\n\nHowever, with time, and intervention of authorities, police complied and the on-ground team reached the site of work.\n\n\"We were among a few companies that had a 100 per cent fulfilment rate throughout the lockdown,\" added Chakradhar Gade, co-founder, Country Delight. He said right from the time lockdown was announced, the entire team of Country Delight started 'over-communicating' with each stakeholder present in the supply chain.\n\n\"When you communicate, you understand what the broad concerns for each of these stakeholders are,\" he added.\n\nApart from changing delivery slots, the company reached out to local police stations and built a backup production facility not to hamper the production.\n\nIn the following months, Country Delight doubled down on its takeaway centres as it split their distribution centres and installed Bluetooth devices to track distance between people at their centres.\n\nLargest Producer But Low Consumption Rate?\n\nOver the years, India has managed to produce sufficient milk to cater to 1.3 billion people. However, the consumption per capita of milk in the country hovers around 400 gm per day, despite being the largest milk producer. Experts believe the main reason behind a low consumption per capita is the lack of popularity of value-added products such as cheese, paneer, yoghurt, among others. In western countries, consumption per capita of milk range in kilograms as 81 per cent of the milk products are eaten, whereas in India 65 per cent prefer drinking milk.\n\nAccording to Gade of Country Delight, value-added products are not 'truly Indian' in nature and doesn't fit the lifestyle of Indian consumers.\n\nGade said even people living in cities prefer fresh and unadulterated milk to consume directly compared with value-added products as people know that milk is a perishable product.\n\nApart from this, Gade said Indian milk brands are imitating western companies while producing value-added products. Taking an example of ultra-high temperature milk (UHT) and yoghurt brands, Gade noted that they only comprise four to five per cent of the market. \"Bulk of the Indian consumers prefer products like Misti doi, or Rabdi (Indian sweet). So brands need to research to understand consumer preference before launching a new product,\" he added.\n\nExplaining further he said people generally mix turmeric, ginger or badam in milk while consuming at home.\n\nOpportunities In the Dairy Sector\n\nThough there was a 30 per cent drop in milk consumption in the initial months of lockdown according to a CARE rating report, a significant surge in household consumption and spur in premium milk product for quality packaging has cushioned the consumption fall.\n\nCurrently, India produces 572 trillion litres of milk from 300 million cattle every day. This comprises 4.1 per cent of the country's GDP. According to Mukundan, of the 572 million litres, 143 million litres of milk, i.e., 25 per cent, is sourced to the organized sector, 42 per cent is consumed locally whereas 33 per cent is sold at local mom and pop shops.\n\n\"Organized sector is growing at 20 per cent per year, and the dairy industry as a whole is growing at 6 per cent per year. There is a large room for growth as India still comprise 75 per cent of the unorganized sector,\" added Mukundan.\n\n\"India has a huge addressable market, and till now there has been only a handful of players trying to disrupt the market,\" said Ishpreet Singh Gandhi, founder and managing partner of Stride Ventures.\n\nAccording to him, India can be a pioneer in terms of deriving technology-based solutions. \"There are state-to-state hurdles present in this country. If a player can look into this problem and serve products to consumers in different states, then I believe the particular solution can be used internationally as well,\" added Gandhi.\n\nFrom an investor's perspective, Gandhi believes that milk is an underlying commodity, which has not seen disruption despite multiple lockdowns. \"That's one factor which excites people supporting these companies despite their limited runways,\" added Gandhi.\n\nDuring this tough time, a lot of startups opted for collaboration to stay afloat. Gade believes cross-sector collaboration has been benefiting both parties during these tough times.

The International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) World Economic Outlook predicts the cumulative loss to the world\u2019s GDP from 2020 to 2021 will be approximately $9 trillion. That\u2019s more than the combined economies of Germany and Japan.\n\nBut the crisis has disrupted more than global markets; it has changed peoples\u2019 lives, needs, priorities and spending behaviors. Approximately 40 per cent of Australians are feeling financially insecure, and as a result, professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts that household consumption will decline by $37.9 billion within the next year.\n\nIn harsh economic conditions, consumers become more discerning with where and how they spend their money\u2014for businesses, this creates a new set of challenges.\n\nCustomer-centricity is a term that has been used since the 1960s, but it has never been more relevant than in today\u2019s business landscape. In such extreme environments, customers want more than the best offering or the lowest price; they seek dependability, confidence and trust in the brands they choose to do business with.\n\nThe end goal for a customer-centric business is customer loyalty. A dedicated customer base is key to surviving disruption, as they will continue to depend on your services even in challenging climates. But true customer-centricity is no set-and-forget solution. Retaining loyalty is about adapting your offering depending on the changing needs of your customers, and in some instances, knowing what they want before they do. This is where the modern reality of customer-centricity starts to connect operations with experiences, creating new dimensions of customer excellence.\n\nSo how are businesses expected to predict or adjust to evolving customer expectations? It begins with understanding how your company operates and what you need to change to keep your loyal customer base as close as possible.\n\nHere are three ways businesses can adapt to changing customer relationships, in light of COVID-19.\n\nLet growth goals take a backseat\n\nIf growing your customer base is a priority for your business right now, take a moment to reflect on the long-term cost of that growth, both reputation-wise and financially, to determine whether it is a sustainable pathway.\n\nFew businesses have been left untouched, if not unscathed, by COVID-19. Consequently, many companies have been forced to refocus their priorities, resources and goals to survive the crisis. If your business has not considered the immediate or future economic impact of the pandemic and how it could affect your organization, you need to start doing so now.\n\nPart of evaluating this impact is looking at factors you can control, or at the very least maintain, to ensure you keep as close to \u2018business as usual\u2019 as possible. A central element of your survival strategy is maintaining your existing customer base.\n\nFocusing on customer acquisition to the detriment of your existing ones can create a funnel effect, whereby a stream of new business comes in, while just as many customers go elsewhere. This can force companies into a spiral of deeper and deeper discounts to attract new consumers to their pool, which eventually runs dry along with their revenue streams.\n\nResearch by Forrester shows that new customers can cost five times more to convert than existing customers, indicating that it is much easier to expand and build-on existing loyalty than it is to tap into new client bases, especially during tough times.\n\nDo not fear missing out on opportunities for growth; rather, consider this crisis a chance to cement the fundamental processes and market share that make your business scalable.\n\nAlways remember; there is no point investing in your business\u2019 continuity if you have no customers on the other side.\n\nFocus on operational excellence, but keep it customer-centric\n\nHistorically, a continuous improvement mindset revolved around things such as standardized costs, stable operations and meeting compliance expectations. While these are all critical elements of running a business, somewhere along the way, these companies lost their grip on the bigger picture and realized their product was no longer relevant to the customer.\n\nOperational excellence is important, but carrying out a process 10 per cent better than the previous year does not matter if you miss the mark with your customer base.\n\nMore recently, businesses have started tapping into a different mindset that sees the customer experience translated throughout an end-to-end process. For truly customer-centric organizations, every decision and ambition has a customer-focused outcome in mind, be that improved experience or lasting sentiment.\n\nContinuous improvement no longer exists in an echo-chamber; the convergence of process excellence and customer experience is the new north star, and this mindset is embedded into the very structure of a business and its team.\n\nData-driven for precision\n\nIn a post-pandemic era, digital marketing and social communication channels are the name of the game, and when used correctly, can offer more specific insights into your customers\u2019 behaviors.\n\nUtilizing customer data can be as simple as surveying your existing customer base to gain actionable insights. The more data you have, the more accurate these insights will be.\n\nConsider every digital touchpoint of your customers\u2019 experiences as though they are leaving behind a fingerprint, containing a goldmine of DNA or data that helps you better understand their needs, expectations and concerns.\n\nTo develop a comprehensive customer excellence picture, it helps to combine each touchpoint into what is known as journey maps; a high-level, intuitively readable diagram that enables you to view the user experience from an outside-in perspective\u2014across all your personas. The journey visualization will increasingly identify areas for persona-centric process improvement, while empowering business mapping, change, and operational transformation.\n\nKeeping your finger on the customers\u2019 pulse means you are on the front foot when it comes to evolving patterns of behavior. Immediate access to data-driven insights allow you to adapt your processes and keep customers\u2019 satisfied, even in rapidly changing environments, boosting loyalty and retention rates.\n\nUsing these adaptations, businesses can come out of this crisis with the right fundamentals in place\u2014rather than a set of lowest common denominators that damage your brand in the long term.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353314", "author": ["Dr. Gero Decker"]}, {"title": "Being a Rainmaker During COVID-19", "text": "April 22, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nOver the last few weeks, we have seen\u2014and will continue to see\u2014survival of the fittest.

Refocus your efforts on being a great rainmaker and build your base, not just in customers, but also your talent, your product, marketing and sales, finance, legal and human resources.\n\nA simple, but strategic question, these founders need to ask themselves is what happens when life returns to normal and all of this is over? How do you build good habits when the world comes back to normalcy?\n\nFor companies in bucket three who just addressed the onslaught of demand or MAU, here are a few considerations:\n\nOn runway: Runway is survival. That\u2019s why bucket 1 companies should go on ice. We have seen too many startups (even in normal times) that have to shut down because they made the most rosey or hopeful assumptions. Now is not the time to plan on the most optimistic scenarios. When you don\u2019t know what to expect, runway is the single most important determinant of survival. Cut your burn so you can survive longer.\n\nOn talent: Don\u2019t be cheap. Find the best people for your team now, whether it is another rainmaker, a CFO or a CMO. This is also your opportunity to see who among your team is cool under fire, who you would want with you in the thick of battle. Keep these folks with you the rest of your career.\n\nOn the business model: Besides being a great rainmaker selling and fulfilling heavy demand from customers, ascertain what you can do to ensure the world continues to stay more in your favor post-pandemic. Are there any adjustments that need to be made in terms of cost structure, loyalty point system or membership model?\n\nOn customer retention: How do you continue to build and keep people using your product when things go back to normal? What additional products can you offer? How can you continue to be \u2018addictive\u2019 to your customers who will be going out more and may not be engaging as much on your collaborative tool or edtech platform? Do you need to create new digital content and marketing strategy?\n\nWhile things are good now, take a step back, and think about what the new normal will be and your business\u2019 place in this new reality. If anything, coronavirus has put an accelerant on digitalization and adoption of many new things for consumers including online shopping, remote working, online education and productivity tools.\n\nThe shift of consumer behavior in Southeast Asia will also enable the growth of other verticals including logistics and fintech. Ironically, we also see consumers returning to similar behavior we\u2019ve seen in previous recessions or downturns, which is a shift towards more budget-friendly spending. Another outcome of all this is greater demand for more cost-efficient and better solutions from consumers, pushing founders to reiterate and refine business ideas, models and solutions.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349636", "author": ["Peng T Ong"]}, {"title": "The Great Potential Of Decentralized Finance in 2020", "text": "July 21, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nBefore Ethereum there was Bitcoin, and all hopes were put into the community and its capabilities to develop the network. When Ether entered the game, it opened up a new realm of possibilities for its decentralized applications. Its smart contracts and tokenization capabilities started a conversation about the next steps for traditional finance and how it can take advantage of this new technology. However, it is important to know the difference between traditional financial tools and those built on decentralized networks. Let us delve into what distinguishes decentralized finance (DeFi) from traditional finance, and also discuss some potential use cases for dApps (decentralized applications) and the current regulatory issues related to DeFi.\n\nJust a year ago, when DeFi Pulse started publishing statistics on the monetary value locked in DeFi, the total amount was $276 million. Today, nearly $2 billion is locked in the DeFi market.\n\nThe groundwork for more potential capabilities of DeFi instruments has been laid. As Chris Burniske from venture capital firm Placeholder noted: \u201cIf you think DeFi will have a smaller impact on ETH than ICOs, you aren't paying attention. The ICO boom showcased Ethereum's ability to perform one financial service: early-stage capital formation. DeFi will showcase Ethereum's ability to perform all financial services.\u201d\n\nDuring these uncertain times, the adoption rate of innovative banking solutions is increasing rapidly. Therefore, the current economic challenges facing countries, companies and individuals could lead to better solutions for the future.\n\nTraditional Apps vs dApps: Application vs Protocols\n\nWhat\u2019s the big difference between the applications that we use daily, like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and decentralized applications, like asset management tools and exchanges? Previously, protocols such as HTTP built data directly on the application layer. Investing in applications produced higher returns than investing in protocol technologies. This is why most popular applications consist of \u2018fat\u2019 applications and \u2018thin\u2019 protocols. In blockchain, this relationship is reversed, with most of the value concentrated at the shared \u2018fat\u2019 protocol layer while the \u2018thin\u2019 application layer provides a limited interface service.\n\nThe shared protocol layer and open network is what makes decentralized applications stand out. Big corporations monopolize their user data by capturing users with their interface. Most social network applications do not share any data between each other, which forces users to stick to their favorite interfaces. Meanwhile, blockchain networks can\u2019t own a certain interface because they are each built independently, using many of the same protocols.\n\nExisting infrastructure makes developing these applications easier and cheaper, which, in turn, leaves more room for updates and releases. As Joel Monergo from Placeholder explained: \u201cThe relationship between protocols and applications is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer. It's a stack with 'fat' protocols and 'thin' applications.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to remember that the industry will thrive if the community grows and attracts innovative specialists. Crypto expert and successful blockchain entrepreneur, Alexander Salnikov, considers this influx of talent key to the future health of the industry: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about putting together protocols and interfaces. What we need in that the DeFi space has more talented and motivated entrepreneurs. Opportunities for businesses to generate profit will attract more talent and encourage further developments which are beneficial for both the protocols and their interfaces.\u201d\n\nDApps Functionality\n\nAccording to defiprime, currently, out of the 205 DeFi projects listed, 193 are built on Ethereum. The largest chunk of this market consists of lending dApps. Some platforms also enable users to enter into leveraged positions, utilizing tokenized margin lending and trading. Through smart contracts, lenders and borrowers can interact directly, making lending easier and faster. The adoption of such technology will inevitably bring to light the issues within the traditional global banking systems and offer an alternative, decentralized solution.\n\nThe more funds get channeled into the DeFi sector, the more diversity it brings to the ecosystem. While lending and credit systems, asset management tools and other crypto-finance applications dominate the space, there are unlimited possibilities of what dApps can bring to the table. The architecture that allows outsourcing various tasks to shared networks makes building new applications fast and cheap which is great for startups.\n\n\u201cDeFi projects have great compatibility with each other which means that new features can be developed and then implemented into existing and new services. All of DeFi was built with these tools, these so-called \u2018money legos\u2019, that can be put together in any way, because the technology is open, programmable and flexible,\u201d Alexander adds.\n\nGetting paid for freelance work and reaching agreements with freelance specialists is also made easy and safe with smart contracts. Ethlance is a blockchain job board that allows payments only in cryptocurrency. There is also a crypto-collectibles world where artists can tokenize their work and the buyer can display it in their virtual gallery. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, these tokens are non-fungible which means that every asset is unique or limited in quantity. There are already marketplaces for these collectibles such as Rarible, and VR galleries where they are displayed such as Cryptovoxels.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe blockchain and crypto industries still face many challenges due to regulatory concerns. Completely decentralized applications raise flags with regulators over fraudulent transactions and money laundering matters. There is also some uneasiness regarding all the responsibility put upon developers in the decentralized application field.\n\nWith mainstream institutional giants venturing into DeFi, users are getting a broader variety of services and providers. However, at this moment, only custodial wallets can be reliably regulated because of their standard KYC/AML procedures.\n\nSimultaneously, the current regulatory flux could provide a perfect opportunity to enter the market. Ivan Starinin, experienced blockchain entrepreneur, who has made a name for himself with several successful projects, agrees: \u201cThere is currently a lack of regulation that creates concerns for those who want to invest large amounts into the market. The same pattern we saw with blockchain and crypto, where regulation trailed behind technology, is happening now with DeFi. However, this lack of regulation means we are only at the initial stage of development and there are plenty of opportunities for higher revenue and ecosystem development\u201d.\n\nThe Future of Finance is Decentralized\n\nSome community members have already dubbed 2020 the year of the \u201cDeFi Renaissance.\u201d Amidst the global health and economic crisis, stablecoins have risen in popularity bringing new institutional and individual players into the market. DeFi token values have surged by 200per cent since the beginning of the year. The opportunities for startups using this technology are endless which is promising for the DeFi ecosystem diversification and growth. New game-changing DeFi applications are going to emerge, built at a lesser cost and primed to cross over into the mass market.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353588", "author": ["Emma Cassel"]}, {"title": "97% Enterprises Claim COVID-19 Boosted Their Digital Transformation Efforts: Twilio Report", "text": "July 21, 2020 3 min read\n\nTwilio, a leader in cloud communications platform, on Tuesday announced the results of a global survey measuring the impact and outlook of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses\u2019 digital engagement strategies.\n\nThe San Francisco-based firm surveyed over 2,500 enterprises to understand the magnitude of the pandemic on the firms and their digital transformation and communication roadmap.\n\nThe report titled The COVID-19 Digital Engagement Report is a snapshot of how businesses have addressed the complex challenges posed by this crisis and how they will continue to evolve moving forward.\n\nThe report found out that the pandemic has accelerated companies\u2019 digital communications strategy by an average of six years.

They have the attitude, the skills and can spot opportunities that are right for them. They are excited about life, they are prepared and know they will handle whatever life throws their way.\n\nMore than ever, successful kids are exposed to ideas normally associated with entrepreneurship. To be a successful entrepreneur requires creativity, empathy, communication skills, problem-solving ability, practical mathematics and a knack for spotting something at the right moment and having the confidence to act.\n\nRaising a child with an awareness of entrepreneurship and the associated skills can change their life for the better even if they don\u2019t go on to start or scale a business. At the very least, the same set of skills will steer them towards opportunities that are right for them.\n\nRelated: Bill Gates and Steve Jobs Raised Their Kids Tech-Free -- and It Should've Been a Red Flag\n\nBeing successful in the coming decades will be much harder than for previous generations. People already change jobs every few years, industries morph constantly, and constant disruption is fast becoming the new normal.\n\nIn your child\u2019s career, they will work with people from all over the world, they will encounter incredibly complex problems, they will be displaced, they will be isolated from their neighborhood friendship groups at times and they will have to navigate this fast-changing landscape using their whits. Entrepreneurial skills like pitching, pivoting and acceding resources beyond your control will be essential in everyone's working life.\n\nYour kid doesn\u2019t need to actually be running a business, employing people and presenting pitch decks to investors in order to gain these skills - Being a kid is stressful enough. Introducing your child or teen to entrepreneurial ideas can be simple. Things like describing work as something fun and creative, letting kids buy the groceries online, paying pocket-money for results rather than chores and getting a teen to pitch using PowerPoint slides for that pet they want you to buy. Simple ideas that are fun, entrepreneurial and valuable.\n\nAfter gathering stories from over 200 parents, we found four cornerstones of raising entrepreneurial kids.\n\n1. Develop an entrepreneur mindset\n\nInstilling them with beliefs and values that are aligned to entrepreneurship can start early. Beliefs like \u201cmaking mistakes is part of \u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of money out there for the right opportunity\u201d are worthwhile beliefs. An entrepreneur mindset will give them an awareness of opportunities to create something of value, to positively disrupt a situation, to collaborate towards an outcome or to make money other own terms. Rather than seeing the world of work as something to be endured and tolerated, you\u2019ll give them an understanding that work can be fun, creative and rewarding.\n\nRelated: Here's How You Can Encourage Creative Thinking in Children\n\n2. Introduce entrepreneurial skills\n\nGiving them a chance to develop skills like sales, pitching, marketing, product creation, accounting, customer service, deal-making, negotiation and leadership will change their life no matter what they eventually do for work. Rather than purely focusing on the academic skills that are needed to get good grades, raising entrepreneurial kids is about developing the soft skills that are often associated with dynamic careers.\n\n3. Give them real-world opportunities\n\nWe learn by doing. We also learn by experimenting, tinkering and making mistakes. Rather than shielding your children from the outside world, protect them as they interact with real-life entrepreneurial scenarios that teach powerful lessons. Get them talking to the neighbors about doing their lawnmowing, encourage them to sell items on Facebook Marketplace or go and talk to a marketing agency about their product idea.\n\n4. Mentor them (rather than teach)\n\nat any stage of business can benefit from the guidance of a coach or mentor. Coaching is based on the premise that the answer is there if you go looking and get resourceful. A coach or a mentor guides kids towards more resourceful ideas and behaviors without necessarily telling them the answers. You may also encourage your children to meet and learn about entrepreneurs who create jobs rather than work in them, who have invented something, done deals or managed a successful business. Introducing your kids to entrepreneurial role-models in the real world can leave a lasting impression that \u201cif it\u2019s possible for them it\u2019s possible for me\u201d.\n\nChildren as young as 4 will respond to ideas like delayed gratification, helping others, being rewarded and paying money for things. For those with teens, you\u2019ll see the spark of creative ignite if you challenge them to earn money selling items online, offering a car-cleaning service in the neighborhood or helping a small business get set up with social media accounts.\n\nUltimately the bigger picture of raising an entrepreneurial kid is not about pushing your child to be the next Steve Jobs or Anita Roddick \u2014 it doesn\u2019t even matter if they never start a business at all in their life. What matters most is that your child feels a sense of control in this strange world at this strange time in human history. They feel they have the power to set good goals that are right for them, pursue those goals and pivot when they chose to. These ideas and skills will serve them no matter what they chose to do.\n\nEntrepreneurship isn\u2019t about balance sheets and profit targets, it\u2019s about serving others in a scalable and sustainable way. It\u2019s about finding solutions to complex problems and enrolling others into your vision. As humanity comes closer and closer to the edge of what\u2019s possible and what\u2019s wise, more than ever we will need people who are ready to lead in a world that has difficult decisions.\n\nThe entrepreneurial skills you develop in your child today might be the key to them having a great career, starting a game-changing business or solving a meaningful problem at scale.\n\nNote: Keep an eye out for the book \"How to Raise Entrepreneurial Kids\" which will be out late 2020.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353191", "author": ["Daniel Priestley"]}, {"title": "Make an Empire, Not a Business", "text": "July 17, 2020 3 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nMake an empire, not a business.\n\nIf you want to be timeless, you need to be flexible.\n\nThe thing about my business is that, if the situation requires changing the business model or expansion, I don\u2019t need to start from the beginning.

Your clients love you, you love running your business and serving your clients and you\u2019re always striving to improve on your skills. Your business couldn\u2019t be better ... or could it?\n\nAs a business owner, much of your time is spent focussing on ways to reach your clients and help them \u2014 and that makes sense, because the work you do is important. But the easiest way to increase profits can be overlooked, and that's by looking at your internal structure.\n\nIf you\u2019re not keeping your bookkeeping records organized and current, you are wasting an opportunity to tighten your costs and increase the financial health of your business. When your books are current and set up well, you can run those numbers and get extremely valuable feedback on how your business is performing.\n\nThe top five benefits of keeping your books current are:\n\n1. Know your cash flow.\n\nCash flow is one of the most important areas that keeps you in business \u2014 if you can\u2019t pay your bills, you won\u2019t stay in business for long. So if you\u2019re short on cash, that will likely stress you out and keep you up at night.\n\nAccording to a U.S. Bank study, 82 percent of business failure is caused by poor cash management.\n\nWhen your books are set up with a good system, understanding your cash flow position is as quick as clicking a button to run your report. You\u2019ll know what bills you have coming up, and if you have enough cash in the bank to cover them. This allows for proper planning and if a potential problem arises, you can be aware of the fact before it stresses you out and allows you to be proactive.\n\nRelated: How POS Is Improving the Efficiency Of Business Accounting\n\n2. Be on top of client payments.\n\nIf you want to keep your books current, you have to invoice clients immediately, which gets your payment in the door a lot more quickly. You can also run reports on a weekly basis that will show when clients are late in payment, so you can follow up more quickly and prevent a late payment from becoming an issue. This helps with maintaining excellent client relationships and retention because your client will appreciate your organized and efficient follow-up, rather than having a payment dispute down the road.\n\nRelated: 3 Essentials for Building a Loyal Customer Base\n\n3. Save money on late payments.\n\nCurrent books mean you know what payments are due when and you can manage your cash flow to ensure you have the cash to pay the bills when they\u2019re due. This saves a lot of money on late fees and interest charges. And this helps maintain supplier relations. Your suppliers will value you as a good client, and often offer benefits or discounts for preferred clients. And if you\u2019re in a pinch and need special attention from them, they\u2019ll help you out happily.\n\nAccording to Sage, one in 10 invoices are paid late, resulting in a global impact of $3 trillion.\n\n4. Know your profit margins and adjust accordingly.\n\nYou know what profit margins you want to keep in your company, and when you set up your books to account for each line of service or product you offer, when your profit margins are falling short, you can correct immediately. If a supplier increases the price of a product you need from them, you will see immediately how that will impact your bottom line. When you see the cost structure of the product you sell you can easily make adjustments and scenarios to see how these changes affect the overall margins for the products.\n\nRelated: What Are the Top Five Things That to Keep in Mind While Using Accounting Software?\n\n5. Identify the money leaks before they become a big problem.\n\nWhen your books are current, you can see where you are spending more on a service than you intended to. Marketing is typically a large expense, so keeping current records allows you to monitor the dollars you\u2019ve spent there and helps you manage your budget accordingly.\n\nRunning regular reports allows you to determine earlier on when you are spending too much on a certain expense in your business.\n\nThe bottom line is when you keep a good accounting system in your business, your financial reports will identify issues early in the process and resolve issues before they become a bigger problem, and you can plug money leaks in your business very quickly. Just by tightening up your accounting processes and procedures, when you start plugging money leaks, make cost adjustments and changes, you are ensuring you are keeping your business profitable.\n\nWhen you see how these systems make your life so much easier and help you make your business that much more profitable, you\u2019ll wonder what took you so long to get these systems in place.

It helps get your name out there, and can even lead to media coverage for you and your company.\n\nBest of all, the rise of has made authorship more accessible than ever for entrepreneurs. You don\u2019t need to seek out a deal with a major publisher. Instead, you can self-publish and start selling your book on Amazon or promoting it through your site.\n\nWhile self-publishing allows you to get your book to market quickly, self-publishing is rife with potential pitfalls. Avoiding these six rookie mistakes will ensure that you look like a professional, not a novice.\n\n1. Skipping the editing process\n\nYou aren\u2019t done with your book once you type \u201cthe end\u201d or its equivalent. published by major publishers go through several rounds of revisions and edits before they hit store shelves. If you neglect editing your self-published book, you risk coming across as sloppy and unprofessional.\n\nEditing should cover grammar and spelling issues, but it can also reveal flaws in the structure or organization of your book. You might not have put enough emphasis on certain topics, or maybe you repeated certain points multiple times in the text. Enlist the help of a few beta readers to go through your manuscript to get an idea of what is or isn\u2019t working.\n\nRelated: Why Every Entrepreneur Should Write a Book\n\n2. Picking a poor title\n\nA title can make or break any piece of entertainment \u2014 be it a book, newspaper article or movie. Your title needs to grab the audience\u2019s attention while still giving them an idea of what to expect in your book.\n\nOne common suggestion for business and other nonfiction books is to combine a \u201ccreative\u201d title with an indicative subtitle that tells readers what your book is about.\n\nAs one example, Greenville University\u2019s Deloy Cole explains, \"Eats, Shoots and Leaves: A Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation, is a masterful combination of creative title with meticulous, content-oriented subtitle. The title alone wouldn\u2019t make a reader aware of the book\u2019s subject (apart from actually reading the book), but the subtitle turns the book into something other than an ambiguous scene of gustatory violence.\u201d\n\n3. Not hiring a professional cover designer\n\nFew things will drive readers away like an ugly front cover. The visual elements of your book\u2019s cover will often catch a reader\u2019s eye before the title does. Unless you\u2019re a professional graphic designer, this means you should turn this job over to a professional who will design an engaging cover that matches the content of your book.\n\nJust how important is a book cover, exactly?\n\nA survey by The Book Smugglers found that 79 percent of readers reported that book covers played a \u201cdecisive role\u201d when deciding to buy a book, with 48 percent saying the cover played \u201ca major role.\u201d With hardcover books, 40 percent said an ugly cover would even keep them from buying a book they were previously interested in.\n\n4. Neglecting your book\u2019s marketing needs\n\nMany entrepreneurs self-publish a book as a form of marketing for their business. But your book also needs to be marketed to make an impact. In an email conversation, J.J. Hebert, president of MindStir Media, a self-publishing services company, explained, \u201cEvery book needs a marketing plan that starts before release and continues for at least a few months after the book releases. Hundreds of thousands of books are self-published every year. A few social media posts aren\u2019t going to get you the traction you need to stand out and get meaningful sales numbers.\u201d\n\nIn addition to social media campaigns, self-published authors should use email lists and newsletters to tell subscribers about the book. Actively participating in online industry groups will ensure that when you talk about your book, you won\u2019t come across as spammy. Media outreach (especially on a local level) can also drive momentum for your book release.\n\n5. Forgetting print and digital formatting\n\nSelf-publishing is very much a DIY endeavor \u2014 and that often includes formatting the book. Even if you\u2019ve thoroughly edited your book\u2019s content, it will still look sloppy and unprofessional if the text isn\u2019t formatted properly. Even seemingly minor details like section breaks or the type of file you upload can make a difference.\n\nAuthors should be mindful of all formatting guidelines for the program they are using and carefully review the text for any issues before publishing. Remember, ebooks and print books often have different formatting standards. You\u2019ll want to review all versions of your book to ensure that digital readers don\u2019t get an inferior experience.\n\nRelated: 3 Lessons You\u2019ll Learn by Writing a Book About Your Business\n\n6. Poor pricing\n\nBe careful to avoid overpricing or underpricing your book. Pricing a self-published ebook for over $10 will seem too expensive for many buyers. On the other hand, underpricing could indicate to readers that your book isn\u2019t very good. For ebooks, the self-publishing sweet spot is usually around $2.99 to $5.99, depending on the length of the book.\n\nFor print books, you can (and should) go higher to cover the related printing costs. Many full-length paperbacks will sell for $14.99, and some business books are even more. Find a good balance between profitability and an attractive price point.\n\nSet yourself up for self-publishing success\n\nWhen done right, self-publishing can make a big difference for your personal brand. It can even serve as an additional source of revenue that earns money on its own in addition to driving new leads to your business. By taking the time to do self-publishing right, you will make more sales and make a strong, positive impression on your readers.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353397", "author": ["Lucas Miller"]}, {"title": "The Millennial Takeover: How the Generation is Shaking up the Workplace", "text": "July 21, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIn the next five years, the U.S. workplace is poised to experience a changing of the guard.\n\nThe majority of Baby Boomers, now in their upper 50s, 60s, and lower 70s, will be well into retirement age. Their vacated executive positions and managerial roles will most likely be filled by up-and-coming Gen Xers and , if they haven\u2019t already.\n\nCurrently the largest living generation in the U.S., by 2025 Millennials will account for 75 percent of the American workforce. While their habits as consumers often get maligned in the media for bringing about decline in industries and products as wide-ranging as napkins, cable TV, soda, razors, golf, mayonnaise, traditional weddings, department stores, starter homes, and \u201cbreastaurants,\u201d what they bring to the table\u2014rather than take off it\u2014deserves more of the limelight.\n\nLove them or hate them, here are major cultural shifts you can expect to see in the workplace as more Millennials take charge.\n\nMission-driven brands\n\nWhile the jury is still out on whether Millennials are more or less brand loyal than preceding generations (some studies say they are, some say they aren\u2019t, and some say it depends on the product category), one thing is for certain: Millennials value brands that demonstrate authenticity, and that authenticity is shown by remaining true to a cause.\n\nThis is the case for both patronage and workplace preference. Millennials want to buy from and work for businesses that have a purpose at their core. A job is no longer just about a paycheck and putting food on the family table; for Millennials, it\u2019s very much about purpose, with 75 percent saying they want their personal values to align with their company\u2019s values and are even willing to take a pay cut to work for a value-aligned company.\n\nCo-authors John Izzo and Jeff Vanderweilen call it the forthcoming \u201cPurpose Revolution.\u201d Employees, customers and investors are increasingly looking beyond a company\u2019s bottom line to ask how it\u2019s making the world a better place. In the age of social good, the line between for-profit and not-for-profit becomes less rigid, and brands like TOMS, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Patagonia and Warby Parker are all lead actors, as they put their social corporate responsibility front and center, a scorecard against which the world can judge their success. Expect Millennials to continue wearing their social causes on their sleeves as they move up the ranks and have a greater say in shaping their own company\u2019s mission.\n\nEmpathetic\n\nAnother area in which you can expect to see Millennials making change is in leadership style. Fading are the days of the corporate strongman, whose word becomes instant workplace policy, and whose authority is derived solely by title or position.\n\nIt could be the result of growing up in a postmodern era, but many Millennials are very aware, and skeptical, of power dynamics, and tend to see legitimate authority as earned rather than assumed. Consequently, Millennials respond better to leaders who inspire by example and embody the mission of the company. A big part of authentic leadership is the willingness to solicit feedback and hear out ideas, not just from one\u2019s own C-suite peers, but from all levels of an organization.\n\nThat ability to understand and share the feelings of others is what we call empathy, and it\u2019s a huge component of emotional intelligence. Empathy is especially important for leaders, as they need to understand what truly motivates their team in order to build a successful, thriving culture on that foundation. Moreover, empathy is especially important today, as Daniel Goleman writes in Harvard Business Review, for three main reasons:\n\nWork is increasingly team-based\n\nThe world is increasingly globalized, requiring coordination among diverse persons\n\nSuccess is often dependent on retaining the best talent\n\nAs they step into leadership roles, expect Millennials to perform like the kind of leaders they most respect\u2014the charismatic, caring, and listening kind.\n\nFlattened hierarchy\n\nEver noticed how suits, once a staple of corporate America (Mad Men, anyone?), are slowly losing their prominence among the office dress code?\n\nYou could blame it on Silicon Valley. Tech execs like Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg have for years evinced a dressed-down style that\u2019s more Tony Hawk than Tom Ford. The trend is so prevalent that Vox declared suits are now mostly reserved for \u201cpowerful men when they\u2019re in trouble\u201d (aka Zuckerberg at a Congressional hearing).\n\nBut the waning popularity of suits is symptomatic of something bigger than just workplace fashion trends. It\u2019s about corporate structure. Along with open offices, corporate town halls, employee stock ownership, and rotating team leaders, casual attire is part of a larger Millennial-driven trend toward a flattened hierarchy in the workplace.\n\nSometimes described as a \u201cflat organization\u201d or a \u201cholacracy,\u201d a flattened hierarchy reduces bureaucracy overall and aims to eliminate the mid-management levels between executives and entry-level employees. Shrinking that gap has a number of advantages. Besides reducing unnecessary labor costs, it stresses individual responsibility and encourages each team member\u2019s personal investment in the company; facilitates a freer flow of communication; allows for quicker, more nimble decision-making; and empowers team members to be proactive in leading and offering solutions rather than placing that burden entirely on the shoulders of the CEO.\n\nAnd a flattened hierarchy is more in line with the type of leadership Millennials most resonate with\u2014the kind that\u2019s on their level rather than in some aloof, top-floor corner office.\n\nAt home with disruption\n\nBorn between 1981 and 1996, Millennials have grown up witnessing tremendous technological change, from the introduction of computers in the home, to dial-up internet, the dot-com boom, broadband, nearly ubiquitous Wi-Fi, the Internet of Things, cloud computing, self-driving vehicles, smartphones, smart houses, smart everything.\n\nNobody knows more experientially than Millennials the evidence for Moore\u2019s Law\u2014that computer chip-based technology seems to double every one-and-a-half to two years. Needless to say, for them, disruption has become clich\u00e9, a buzzword that\u2019s lost its buzz.\n\nWhile \u201cdigital natives\u201d may gloss over the fact that Millennials come from diverse upbringings with unequal access to technology, the gist remains: as a generation accustomed to constant software updates and the breakneck pace of change, Millennials understand that successful businesses need to be ready to adapt or die.\n\nConsider Apple\u2019s goal to roll out a new iPhone every year and Facebook\u2019s frequent overhauls. The generation that\u2019s brought us Airbnb, Lyft, Groupon, Spotify, Tinder, Oculus RV, Stripe and nearly every social media platform imaginable will make it a key operational philosophy for the companies under their watch to remain relevant or risk fading into obscurity.\n\nFlexible work/life\n\nThat same saturation with communication technologies that earns Millennials the label of digital natives has also taught them how hard it can be to \u201cturn off.\u201d When your mobile phone is your work phone and an office email can appear on your smartwatch at any time, the traditional nine-to-five schedule can take on the dreamlike aura of a bygone time in which it was once possible to keep work life enjoyably distinct from personal life.\n\nIn reaction, many Millennials have pushed back against the \u201calways-on\u201d expectations at their jobs and advocated for better work/life balance in their careers, which makes sense. Burn out is real, and it\u2019s no secret that happier people are more productive employees, and more likely to stick around.\n\nThe irony is that the very technologies that make us accessible around the clock and thus the potential victim of 24/7 work demands are the same technologies that can deliver better work/life balance. For many skill-based creative professions, digital technologies allow for flexible work hours, telecommuting, location independence and a number of other benefits that boost individual control over one\u2019s own work life.\n\nAs we reach a generational tipping point that sees more Millennials in leadership positions, expect them to introduce more workplace policies that contribute to employee happiness, particularly ones that increase self-autonomy and protect work/life balance.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353284", "author": ["Danny Beckett Jr."]}, {"title": "How to Expand Hiring in a New Business", "text": "May 1, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nMost new entrepreneurs are eager to expand as quickly as possible.

So how can you scale up your hiring efforts without running into long-term problems that could threaten your business?\n\nThe Problems With Hiring Too Quickly\n\nLet\u2019s start by looking at the main problems with hiring too quickly and hiring too many people:\n\nExpenses. Employees are one of the largest expenses a new business will face, and if you aren\u2019t careful, their costs can quickly overwhelm the business.

First, make sure you take the time to truly analyze and inventory your needs. You want your business to expand, but how quickly do you really need to expand, and how many employees do you really need to accomplish this? For example, you might have a vision for a future with 10 locations and a team of 15 employees per location, but could you accomplish the same results, or nearly the same results, with just eight locations? Or with 12 employees per location? What would those extra two locations or three employees per location be doing? The more exacting you are, the more unnecessary expenses you\u2019ll be able to trim away before you even spend them.\n\nFirst, make sure you take the time to truly analyze and inventory your needs.

You\u2019ll be able to trust their judgment as they expand their own teams. You also won\u2019t get overwhelmed with hiring decisions, meaning you\u2019ll likely make fewer compromises long-term.\n\nNext, try to focus only on one segment at a time.

Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | IndieBound.\n\nThere\u2019s a widely used acronym that you may have heard of: KISS \u2014 keep it simple, stupid. But it\u2019s an old saying, and it needs updating. How about, \u201cKeep it simple, smarty\u201d? Simple is the new smart, and it is, in fact, exactly what most people need to focus on when .\n\nLet\u2019s talk about some key ways you can set up your ageless startup\u2019s mission, values and in a way that provides simplicity and clarity for both you and your customers.\n\nDetermine Your Mission\n\nAt the heart of every new enterprise is the organization\u2019s mission. A mission statement is a short, succinct statement about how you\u2019ll position your organization to interact with the world. What is your business purpose, its meaning and the basis of how you want your new enterprise to serve the field in which it operates?\n\nA mission statement isn\u2019t just an outwardly focused marketing statement, though it is that to some degree. A mission statement is also a very important internal tool for running your business. When you come to a fork in the road, such as deciding whether to take on a new customer or provide a service to another company (for the money or for its relevance to your mission statement), you have the guidance in hand to make that decision. You\u2019ve put up the guard rails to help your future self live up to the potential of the opportunity. You know what your mission is, so you can create partnerships that reflect your values.\n\nA mission statement should motivate you, inspire you and be your key tool for presenting your opportunity to the world. Large businesses often write mission statements to please a wide range of stakeholders and end up pleasing no one. Because you\u2019re an artisan entrepreneur focused on niche markets, you can hone your words to speak to specific problems that inspire action in your own heart and mind and in the responses from customers you want to serve.\n\nA mission statement should specifically cite the purpose of the organization, however inelegant and confusing it might be to others not in your target market. For instance, most people would not care about or even understand the mission statement I use for my current startup. It leaves out almost everyone. My current mission statement is, \u201cI want to make this region the artisan food manufacturing capital of North America.\u201d The people who matter to this project will know exactly what the goal of my current work is and appreciate its importance.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s important to remember that mission statements aren\u2019t written in stone. Adapt them carefully as your circumstances and markets change. Your mission statement will be your guiding star as you sail into the future. Choose it carefully and rely on it.\n\nIdentify Your Values\n\nThe new best practice in business is to emphasize your personal goals, values and ambitions for changing the world in your . By doing so, you\u2019ll attract the customers you need and send those with discordant value systems off to where they belong.\n\nThese are the values you need to use to steer your enterprise. Keep these simple. Be direct. Don\u2019t use extra words. The values you build into your new enterprise are values you must live by yourself. A sample values statement might be, \u201cWe\u2019ll treat every customer as though they\u2019re our family, with respect and understanding.\u201d\n\nKeeping your value statement simple and direct also allows you to be true to yourself and true to your business mission. You\u2019re working to share the values you\u2019re passionate about. Be clear, and keep it simple. The purpose of a values statement isn\u2019t to impress. It\u2019s to educate people about what\u2019s important to you and your business.\n\nThink about what makes you angry with business practices you encounter. What frustrates you about the way people are dealing with subjects you care deeply about? How would you approach the issue differently? Business practices are driven by the value systems behind them. Let this guide you.\n\nSet Your Goals\n\nWith your mission and values in place, you can establish goals for the journey. How will you combine your passion, mission statement and values statement to get the results you want? You establish metrics you can measure. What steps can you put in place to meet your mission and the values behind it?\n\nFollowing KISS principles, you\u2019ll want to identify realistic goals that have meaning and consequence. As solo entrepreneurs, we need to include goals that benefit ourselves and our businesses. Your business goals should be simple, clear, and transparent. Your KISS approach calls for answers that are easy to understand for all who see them. A KISS version of business goals might look like these:\n\nWe will grow and maintain a sustainable, profitable organization.\n\nWe will add one new client per month for the next 12 months.\n\nWe will answer all new inquiries within 24 hours.\n\nGoals help you complete your mission and put your values into action. Goals make your new enterprise work. What problems lay in the way of completing your mission and the values that drive it? How would you get around those obstacles? How could you create a better system that would avoid or solve those problems? Those are your goals.\n\nHow do you know which goals will be most effective to help you carry out your mission? Reverse the design of your products and services. Reverse the design of your enterprise. For the specific problem at hand, start with your answer.\n\nBuild your goals with this result in mind. How have you made the solution simpler? How have you made the process easier? If you want sustainable work, think simple.\n\nMission statements, values statements and goals should be written in service of honoring your passion.

Bezos knew that he was an entrepreneur at heart. Does this feeling resonate with you? Do you feel stuck in your role at work? Do you want to make a difference in the world and have real ownership over your life?\n\nRelated: 8 Ways to Come Up With a Business Idea\n\nIf this sounds familiar, I know how you feel. I was there. For 15 years, I worked in the banking industry for Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, where I held leadership roles in portfolio management and sales, respectively. Despite having a great manager, working alongside an incredible team and enjoying substantial professional gains at the time, I felt something was missing. Deep down, I knew that there was other work I should be doing in the world. I wanted to wake up every day feeling I was doing the work that mattered to me most.\n\nSpurred on by these feelings, I worked nights and weekends for more than five years to build an adventure travel company, The Explorer\u2019s Passage, on the side. Eventually, my business became successful enough for me to to leave banking and run it full time. It hasn\u2019t always been easy \u2014 entrepreneurship is tough. But it is possible to create a business that provides you with financial support, purpose and fulfillment. I'm living proof of that.\n\nRelated: Five Signs That You Have A Great Business Idea\n\nIf you're open to the idea of launching your own company, you have one big decision to make: what your new business will do. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 most people struggle with this aspect. Even Jeff Bezos went through an exhaustive ideation process before he settled on selling books. It can be scary and overwhelming to begin this process. But if you take it step by step, it becomes manageable. Before you know it, you'll have an incredible idea that you're passionate about.\n\nIn my experience, you need to construct an idea that answers three key questions:\n\nWhat are you good at? What do you love? What gives you a sense of fulfillment?\n\nThis is the first in a series of three articles where I explore each of these key elements in your new business ideation process. In this writing, we will dig a little deeper on the first one \u2014 the importance of creating a business which aligns with what you are good at.\n\nWhat are you good at?\n\nEach of us has unique skills and talents to offer to the world \u2014 those things you're innately good at that feel effortless. Sometimes we don\u2019t realize what we're good at because it comes so naturally to us. We believe that we're supposed to work hard at our jobs, so we think that this attribute can't possibly be our purpose.\n\nRelated: Looking for a Business Idea? Turn What Other People Complain About Into an Opportunity.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example. For the past 20 years, Elon Musk has been creating businesses, such as PayPal and Tesla, that have revolutionized industries. Musk has always had a knack for solving problems and seeing the future. His brother Kimbal Musk said in an interview with Rolling Stone, \u201cHe\u2019s able to see things more clearly in a way that no one else I know of can understand. There\u2019s a thing in chess where you can see 12 moves ahead if you\u2019re a grandmaster. And in any particular situation, Elon can see things 12 moves ahead.\u201d Musk businesses are a reflection of these innate skills.\n\nWhen I was attending college near Princeton University, I would always bring friends and family to campus to show them around and give them custom tours. I would talk about the history and architecture of the university. I would show them all the beautiful spots I loved. It was just something I naturally did because I enjoyed it. I didn\u2019t turn it into a business at the time, but everyone knew that if they wanted to see Princeton, then they should go with me. It took me 15 years to realize that maybe I could do this for a living \u2014 showing people the beautiful places around the world that I loved.\n\nRelated: Is Your Business Idea Good? Here's How to Find Out\n\nTake this as an opportunity to start thinking about what comes easily to you.

Use your unique gifts and talents to serve others \u2014 don\u2019t waste them.\n\nWhen I reflected on what I am naturally good at, the following came up for me:\n\nI am good at assembling people in community experiences\n\nI am good at showing people the places that I love\n\nI am good at managing risk\n\nMy unique attributes align perfectly with someone running an adventure travel company. This type of company takes groups of people on exciting adventures to places that are remote and have an element of risk to them.\n\nSo, what about you? What are the things that come naturally to you?\n\nHere are just a few ideas to get you thinking:\n\nSolving problems\n\nManaging risk\n\nStarting new projects\n\nExecuting projects\n\nComing up with creative ideas\n\nOrganizing people or events\n\nOnce you identify your top three ideas, then the next step will be to see if any of them align with what you love and what fulfills you.

After all, it costs money to run a business. Entrepreneurs need to generate revenue if they want to experience any type of lasting success. But I'm not suggesting you give away the cow at no cost, as it were. Rather, that by strategically introducing giveaways or gratis add-ons, you can enjoy significant future growth, and in these five specific areas.\n\n1. Growing your leads list\n\nFree offers are a tried-and-true method of lead generation. Many B2B brands will provide ebooks or other materials in exchange for signing up for their newsletter. This serves as an easy way to collect email addresses that can be leveraged in future marketing campaigns. This type of giveaway is so widespread that Content Marketing Institute reports that 88 percent of B2B companies use content marketing for lead generation.\n\nOf course, similar tactics can also prove effective when selling consumer products. Many brands use product giveaways that encourage people to follow them on social media or sign up for an email list to gain additional entries. The result is more potential buyers who will receive email and social media marketing, leading to future purchases.\n\nRelated: Should You Offer Your Product or Services for Free?\n\n2. Helping others understand what you have to offer\n\nFree trials are a common tactic used by service providers. B2B software companies, video-streaming services and others will typically provide a limited period when users can test out their service for free. This can prove remarkably effective. Growth marketer Lincoln Murphy suggests benchmark conversion rates of 60 percent for trials that require credit card info and 25 percent for \u201copt-in\u201d trials.\n\nA recent conversation with Piotr Orzechowski, CEO of Infermedica, provided further insights. \"In light of COVID-19, we offered a free risk-assessment tool to help triage coronavirus symptoms remotely,\" he explains. \"Ministries of health in Poland and Ukraine implemented this solution on their websites. It was the right thing to do, but it's also allowed organizations to see how our products work. It gives us a chance to show our commitment to quality service, which will undoubtedly lead to new client growth in the future.\"\n\n3. Generating buzz for your brand\n\nProduct giveaways are a great way to grow a following. This is commonly seen with social media contests when a brand or influencer will require that followers tag friends as part of their entry.\n\nWhen done right, this can generate a snowball effect that leads to many people discovering the brand and its products. In fact, a report from Easypromos found that 99.3 percent of contest participants will share links online if the contest incentivizes getting friends to participate.\n\nOf course, the benefits go well beyond brand awareness. Contests can lead to exponential growth in your social media followers and email subscribers. They can also dramatically increase engagement through these channels. More followers and higher engagement will naturally lead to more qualified leads and purchases.\n\n4. Collecting valuable market feedback\n\nYour most loyal customers can serve as an important source of information when testing a new product or service. Speaker and author Brian Tracy has written for this site about how testing products with customers is \u201cthe only real test of a product,\u201d explaining, \u201cGo to a potential customer with your sample or prototype and ask if he would buy it. Be sure to call on the individual who makes buying decisions. Then ask him how much he\u2019d pay for this product. If people criticize your new product idea, ask them why. Ask how the product could be modified to make it more attractive.\u201d\n\nMany customers are willing to test your newest product or service because they view it as a low-risk proposition. They don\u2019t pay anything. They get to try out your next product or service for free and give their honest feedback.\n\nFor your most loyal customers, the potential of being the first to try your next innovation is motivation enough. And the wider of a group you can test, the more diverse and reliable feedback you\u2019ll receive.\n\n5. Upselling purchases\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason why many online retailers like Amazon and Walmart set minimum purchase requirements to qualify for free shipping. It\u2019s an easy way to encourage customers to buy one or two extra products to fill up their shopping cart before checking out. In fact, a UPS study found that in 2017, 48 percent of online shoppers added items to their cart to qualify for free shipping.\n\nSimilar results are possible when you offer a free product or value-added service when customers meet a set minimum purchase threshold. Alternatively, you could bundle a free item with a lower-selling product to boost its sales. Pair relevant products and services together to better upsell to your customers.\n\nRelated: 4 Creative Ways to Use Free Samples to Grow Your Business\n\nFree today, but plenty of profit tomorrow\n\nAs these examples illustrate, giving away products or services for free is all about the long-term results. Whether you\u2019re providing customers with an opportunity to essentially \u201ctry before they buy\u201d or directly motivating additional purchases, strategically introducing these offers will have a positive impact on your bottom line.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/351180", "author": ["Lucas Miller"]}, {"title": "This Company's 7-Year Journey From Kitchen to Acquisition", "text": "June 15, 2020 1 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nJaime Schmidt, founder of Schmidt\u2019s Naturals, was a guest at the most recent Startup Story Live, an extension of the hit podcast The Startup Story that gives everyone in attendance direct access to founders.

The primary ad, or hero ad, is the main sales video used to drive traffic to your website or specific landing page. From there, you can also serve ads specifically to people who watch the primary ad but fail to click through to your site, as well as those who click through but do not make a purchase or fulfill other conversion criteria.\n\nFacebook has created and refined a targeting system that will pinpoint who and where your ads will reach. The more specific you can get in determining target audience clusters, the more effective your video campaign ads will be in reaching potential customers. Some of the targeting factors are age, gender, location, language and many others.\n\nThe more information you can collect and apply, the better you will be able to target your video ads to the consumers who are most likely to make a purchase or use your service. Ideally, you have this information from information about your past customers or will have done industry research.\n\nYou can also use a \u201clookalike audience,\u201d which is an audience that Facebook creates for you based on who is likely to be interested in your business because they are similar to your existing customers or website visitors.\n\nRelated: 4 Tips to Create and Groom a Viral Facebook Video Ad\n\nDo your research\n\nOne effective method for compiling useful data on your target customers is to research the hard data you can find in your product or service review entries. If your business is running short on reviews, look at your competitors\u2019 reviews to get an idea of the kinds of keywords and focus phrases you can use to get started.\n\nAs you go through your own reviews or that of your competitors, make a list of the most frequently used phrases or concepts that people focus on, both positive and negative. Use the most mentioned phrases in the copy that accompanies the video.\n\nSpeaking of competitors, one of the best ways to know what you should and shouldn't be doing is to research your competition. Note the companies that provide that same products or services in the same or similar industry as you by examining their strengths and weaknesses. Look at their reviews to see what other people are saying about them and the way they conduct business.\n\nOnce you have a comprehensive study of several of your competitors you can compare and contrast them to your business to figure out your competitive advantages and how you use them to get a leg up in the market. Seek out competitors who are already running Facebook video ads to learn what is working for them. There is a simple process to find ads that your competition is running on Facebook: Go to the business's Page, select \"Page Transparency\" then \u201cGo to Ad Library.\u201d Pay special attention to the messages they are presenting and how. Think about ways you can improve on their concepts and execution. Scroll through the comments section of each video ad to see direct feedback to their ads. Take notes on constructive criticism and honest reactions to apply them to your video production efforts.\n\nRelated: Why Facebook Says Your Video Ads Should Be Silent\n\nStructuring your Facebook video ad\n\nThere are no hard rules for how to structure your Facebook video ad, but the following elements are generally considered an effective way to quickly and clearly get your message across.\n\nHook: Attention spans for Facebook videos are very short, and users are on Facebook to enjoy their feed and be entertained. You need to grab viewers\u2019 attention within the first couple of seconds or they will scroll away to the next video.\n\nIntroduce the problem: Explain the problem you have the capacity to solve in a clear, concise, compelling manner. Make the viewer feel the pain or whatever problem it is you\u2019re presenting\u2014they may not even know they are experiencing it.\n\nPresent your solution: Present your product or service in a quick, dynamic manner. Offering a solution to the problem you have presented is really about showcasing your product or service for the first time. The goal is to create an \u201caha!\u201d moment that will drive them to your conversion point, whether it is a sale, booking an appointment or filling out a contact information form.\n\nCall to action: Whether you want viewers to go to your website, fill out a form or make a purchase, tell them clearly how to do whatever it is you want them to. This can be anything from \"Shop now\" to \"Buy tickets\" to \"Find out more.\"\n\nEstablish authority: Cover any possible doubts or concerns consumers may have about your product or service. Establish that you are the authority on the subject and that you have the best solution to the problem being presented.\n\nConclusion with second call to action: As you wrap up by leaving the best possible impression about your company and the services you provide, make sure to get one more call to action.\n\nRelated: 17 Ways to Get More Views, Engagement and Shares on Your Facebook Videos\n\nTips for success", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349719", "author": ["Torrey Tayenaka"]}, {"title": "House Wants Four 'Big Tech' CEOs to Testify in Competition Probe", "text": "June 15, 2020 2 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on Engadget\n\n\n\nA House investigation into tech competition may have testimony from some of the biggest names in the industry \u2014 if they agree, at least.

The founder speaks about three emerging trends in the ed-tech sector which is making a significant impact \u2014 enhanced learning accessibility, data analytics for learning, and personalised learning.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/video/335876", "author": ["Dipen Pradhan"]}, {"title": "Why Customer-centricity Wins Out Every Time", "text": "March 24, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nHave you ever considered how technology changes, and it almost goes unnoticed? For example, late last year Instagram quietly phased out the \u2018activity\u2019 tab within its app because users were not engaging with it anymore. Or how Apple\u2019s latest iPhones no longer have 3D Touch, because the feature was inadequately responsive.\n\nThe world\u2019s most disruptive and innovative companies are building their offerings around the needs and desires of their users, otherwise known as taking a \u2018customer-centric\u2019 mentality. This shift away from product obsession proves that the modern customer is more powerful than ever, and businesses - be they startups or established organisations - must rise to meet the demands of their growing expectations.\n\nCustomer-centricity is synonymous with successful businesses, especially as markets are saturated with more choice than ever, and savvy customers are increasingly empowered to explore their options. It\u2019s not just about the lowest price anymore - modern customers expect to be understood too.\n\nSo why is the modern customer so powerful?\n\nDespite a saturated marketplace, the customer voice is louder than ever.\n\nNo other era has experienced such readily available information as today\u2019s digital age. The internet and the rise of social media has given customers a platform to express their opinions, reviews and recommendations - it\u2019s also created market comparison tools so customers can find precisely what they\u2019re looking for at the click of a button.\n\nThere are pros and cons of this; word-of-mouth has the potential to become free-user generated content, and companies can now deliver new products that gain visibility instantly, without needing to spend vast amounts of money on global marketing campaigns. Conversely, a bad review can be seen by thousands - collapsing a brand\u2019s reputation almost readily.\n\nResearch shows that 87 per cent of consumers now begin their product search online. Any successful business has an online presence, whether they have actively built one or otherwise. Relinquishing the control of your business\u2019 reputation to cyberspace can be challenging, but it\u2019s a reality for modern organisations.\n\nCustomers are demanding more, and only businesses that adapt to customer-centric processes will survive such a volatile market.\n\nThe Customer Experience and Your Operations\n\nOperational excellence must now be inextricably linked to customer experience, with the connection of persona, journey, and process giving a 360 degree view of improvement.\n\nThe \u2018customer experience\u2019 describes the journey a customer goes on through interactions; from how they first encounter your business, right through to the delivery of a product or service - every touchpoint counts.\n\nThe key to delivering a seamless customer experience begins by comprehending their behaviours, and predicting future interactions. This is a much more complex process than enforcing polite customer service standards, because it requires an extensive understanding of the customer.\n\nThe most efficient way to gain this understanding is through customer journeys. It allows you to track how a customer interacts with your business by providing detailed insights into their motivations or frustrations throughout each touchpoint. But it is important to remember that these journeys are critical across all personas, not just the customer. This includes patients, citizens, employees, and the end-user.\n\nInstead of assuming how customers interact with your business, journeys provide evidence-based insights - typically through a graph or other visual representation to put the customer perspective into even sharper resolution.\n\nWhether you have 50 customers or 5,000 - this approach lets you see your company from the outside in.\n\nBefore diving head-first into designing customer journeys, consider the following three things:\n\n1. Know your objectives\n\nWhile the overarching aim of customer journey mapping is to better understand how your customer interacts with your business - starting with more specific objectives allows you to ease into the process.\n\nFor example, that might mean revising a current process rather than dismantling it entirely - or focusing on a specific type of customer rather than tackling your entire user-base at once.\n\nSetting yourself narrow objectives within a broader vision will help keep things manageable.\n\n2. Find your key people\n\nCollaboration is your most powerful asset when designing comprehensive customer journey maps.\n\nWhen internal processes undergo significant change, it\u2019s common practice to rely on your C-suite executives for all the answers. However, utilising workers that are closest to your customers will provide first-hand observations of the type of customer-personas you\u2019re dealing with, as well as the most common pain points within existing customer journeys.\n\n3. Test, then test again\n\nFor a truly representative customer journey, you need to hear the facts directly from the source, meaning you must factor in extensive customer research to help define KPIs for continuous improvement.\n\nInterviews, surveys and workshops - even analysing data from your business\u2019 social media accounts - will provide helpful feedback on the various touch points throughout your initial design.\n\nKeep it simple by focusing on the most important elements to include in your journeys, and remember customer experience is a process, rather than an end-game.\n\nCustomer Loyalty\n\nThe rise of disruptors - for example neobanks, ride-sharing companies and coworking startups - have all found a niche solution to modern consumer pain points. On the other hand, we are seeing established organisations scramble to compete. In part, this is due a legacy problem; the belief that past success will translate to future prosperity, often with an emphasis on developing products to entice new customers rather than rewarding their loyal users.\n\nShifting focus from an organisation\u2019s traditional areas of strength, to instead focus on the customer experience can be challenging for even the most agile and responsive businesses. But the fundamental objective of customer-centricity is to gain customers\u2019 loyalty and trust - a commodity that\u2019s becoming more and more rare in today\u2019s volatile marketplaces. In order to build that trust authentically, customer-centric businesses understand that they must provide it too, by investing in understanding the needs and desires of their customers.\n\nNo matter how good a business\u2019 offering is - if it doesn\u2019t have customer loyalty, it won\u2019t survive.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/348106", "author": ["Gero Decker"]}, {"title": "Where Have All the Women Gone?", "text": "April 29, 2019 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe lack of women in leadership roles in tech has become a pervasive problem around the globe. A growing number of enterprises and organizations have been establishing mandates to address the problem. Some are further along that path than others, particularly in North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nEven the most conservative corporations are taking a long, hard, and serious look at gender equality as they face skilled labour shortages and demographic shifts in the workplace. According to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Gender Gap Index, the organization ranks Japan 110th in the world, with women holding only one in 10 leadership positions, making it the worst performer among the G7 industrialized nations.\n\nBut while the spirit is willing, execution can be weak. So, what is the problem?\n\nWhile there is much that can be discussed in terms of the various levels of legislation and corporate mandates, none of those numbers will change significantly if workplaces and practices fail to recruit and retain women talent.\n\nThis is an especially challenging dilemma for the tech sector, where gender inequality at senior levels is even more pronounced than markets such as financial services. According to a 2017 report by the Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, women filled 47 per cent of all jobs in 2015 but held only 24 per cent of STEM jobs. Obviously, this shrinks the available talent pool for senior roles considerably.\n\nA 2017 Canadian survey of more than 900 tech companies found that women account for just five per cent of CEO roles and 13 per cent of executive team positions. More than half of companies have no women executives, only eight per cent of director roles are filled by women, and 73 per cent of firms have no women on their boards at all.\n\nThese numbers are not for lack of trying. Industries and associations are desperately seeking approaches to achieving their diversity at the top initiatives.\n\nIntent By Design\n\nThe answer to this dilemma goes beyond simply hiring more women or announcing gender balance policies. Organizations must design gender equality into the fabric of the business. Only through this \u201cintentional design\u201d approach can you create the kind of organization that women will want to join and where they will want to remain because they know it will afford them the opportunity to grow and contribute and eventually lead and govern.\n\nBut herein lies the problem. There are many blind spots that happen every day that unwittingly reinforce the gender gap within organizations. It could be related to simple things, like wording in job descriptions, or representation at industry events.\n\nFighting Bias\n\nIt can also be complicated. When AI-enabled technologies are developed by a single gender or other specific group, outcomes can be inherently biased. Google\u2019s infamous \u201cthree black teenagers\u201d search is a case in point. Many recruitment tools are also known to eliminate women candidates early in the process because of how the algorithms were developed. Simply put, when you don\u2019t design technologies for a diverse audience, you automatically have bias.\n\nThere are many complexities that go with an intentional design approach. But there are some basics that can help organizations \u2013 and women leaders \u2013 get a clearer picture of where to start, such as:\n\nHost or participate in events that allow women to share and empower others. The power of having women role models is undeniable. If you want to champion other women, put your name forward as a mentor. Beyond networking events, there are tools available that enable mentors to be matched with appropriate people. Tap into talent marketplace services where business leaders can recommend, discover, and connect with highly qualified women. Demand gender balance on speaking panels and conference services. Ensure your recruiting tools don\u2019t have an inherent bias. In 2018, news got out that Amazon had to scrap the recruiting tool they had been building since 2014 because it was built by men and based on predominantly male resume data over a 10-year period. Look to the future. Organizations are now seeing the value of tapping into the next generation of women candidates, sponsoring tech competitions and partnering with educational institutions to help build a larger, more diverse talent pool.\n\nOf course, there is much more to this picture than some simple guidelines. Committing to intentional design requires an honest review of the privileges that are often harboured in processes. It also means understanding the intersectionality of women and creating workplaces that value all aspects of their identity. If you truly want to address the gender gap in senior management, be intentional in everything you do, but more importantly, be bold in your intention to create balanced workplaces.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/331833", "author": ["Jodi Kovitz"]}, {"title": "\u10dd\u10d7\u10ee\u10d8 \u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10e2\u10d8\u10d5\u10d8 \u10d2\u10d6\u10d0 \u10d0\u10d3\u10d0\u10db\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d0\u10d6\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e8\u10d4\u10e1\u10d0\u10ea\u10d5\u10da\u10d4\u10da\u10d0\u10d3", "text": "", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353510", "author": ["\u10ef\u10d4\u10d8\u10e1\u10dd\u10dc \u10e4\u10d0\u10d8\u10e4\u10d4\u10e0\u10d8"]}, {"title": "''\u10da\u10d4\u10d7\u10dd'' - \u10e1\u10e2\u10e3\u10db\u10d0\u10e0-\u10db\u10d0\u10e1\u10de\u10d8\u10dc\u10eb\u10da\u10dd\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10e3\u10d9\u10d4\u10d7\u10d4\u10e1\u10dd \u10e2\u10e0\u10d0\u10d3\u10d8\u10ea\u10d8\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10d7", "text": "", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353636", "author": ["\u10e1\u10d0\u10da\u10dd\u10db\u10d4 \u10e5\u10e3\u10e8\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8"]}]}, "fivethirtyeight_science": {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/", "articles": [{"title": "White Neighborhoods Have More Access To COVID-19 Testing Sites", "text": "When the coronavirus outbreak threatened to rock Philadelphia\u2019s predominantly Black neighborhoods, Dr. Ala Stanford knew that access to COVID-19 tests was going to be a problem.\n\nSo she rented a van, loaded it up and headed to the areas of the city where residents needed tests the most. Every test conducted was free.\n\nWhen Stanford began distributing tests in early April, she saw only a handful of testing centers in the city. Only a small share were in majority-Black neighborhoods, and the bar for actually getting a test was high.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been to locations that are predominantly African American where everyone had insurance and they couldn\u2019t get tested,\u201d said Stanford, referring to the often strict requirements providers had of those seeking tests as the outbreak began, such as doctor referrals, appointments and symptoms consistent with infection.\n\nStanford, a pediatric surgeon, quickly assembled a group of doctors and volunteers called the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium to help meet the challenge of testing the city\u2019s underserved residents. Together, the group has issued Philadelphia\u2019s residents more than 7,000 tests. But even with the intervention of medical professionals like Stanford stepping in to meet the rising demand, many communities of color across the country still face a dire situation in terms of getting a COVID-19 test.\n\nWith nearly 4 million coronavirus cases across the United States and hospitalizations surging in different parts of the country, there continues to be a growing demand for tests. Today, Americans routinely wait for hours to get an exam \u2014 if they can get one at all. Access is not available equally nationwide. Simply put, where Americans live and how much income they earn can still determine the ease with which they get a COVID-19 test.\n\nAccording to a new, extensive review of testing sites by ABC News, FiveThirtyEight and ABC-owned television stations, sites in communities of color in many major cities face higher demand than sites in whiter or wealthier areas in those same cities. The result of this disparity is clear: People of color, especially Black and Hispanic people, are more likely to experience longer wait times and understaffed testing centers.\n\nThis nationwide review is one of the first to look at testing site locations coast to coast, in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., using data provided by the health care navigation company Castlight Health (the same data that Google Maps uses to surface COVID-19 testing sites). An assessment of city and state health department websites also revealed, over and over, fewer testing sites in areas primarily inhabited by racial minorities.\n\nImportantly, our analysis does not factor in the capacity of testing sites, which can vary from just 50 tests at one site to 2,000 at another, meaning that one site might be equipped to serve a larger number of people than another site. Instead, it looks at the potential demand for each site based on the number of people and sites nearby. The data we used is also less likely to reflect tests done in private physicians\u2019 offices than federally-funded community sites, local government-run mobile pop-up sites, urgent care clinics and hospitals. Additionally, this analysis doesn\u2019t take into account other factors that could determine testing accessibility, such as staffing and wait times, as well as other restrictions on testing like appointment or insurance requirements.\n\nWhen the outbreak began, testing posed the most immediate challenge to states, as a shortage of supplies, testing kits and processing backlogs created capacity problems. Since then, states have vastly increased their bandwidth to perform tests, but even now, experts from the Harvard Global Health Institute say daily testing needs to nearly double to help mitigate the pandemic. And states and cities are still struggling to determine how to allocate testing resources and where to place testing centers.\n\nThe Trump administration struggled early on in the pandemic to expand testing nationwide. Reliant on off-shore manufacturing that limited access to supplies like swabs and reagents, and armed with little data about who was getting sick and where, Trump\u2019s political appointees quickly embraced that the federal government\u2019s job would be mostly managing the logistics of testing such as supplies and distribution of state funds, as opposed to overseeing the coordination of state testing plans.\n\nBut critics say that strategy left many states scrambling to meet the rising demand that health experts say will only grow more urgent in the fall, when students return and flu season starts.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recently released a comprehensive strategy to address the disparate access to COVID-19 testing, including expanding testing at federally qualified health centers as well as supporting public-private partnerships that establish testing at retail pharmacy companies to accelerate testing within vulnerable populations. CVS and Walgreens \u2014 two of the retail pharmacies listed in the HHS plan \u2014 both said in statements to ABC News that more than half of their store locations issuing COVID-19 tests are now located in areas most in need, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s social vulnerability index.\n\nWHAT OUR ANALYSIS FOUND\n\nThe novel coronavirus itself does not distinguish between Black and white Americans. But virtually every other aspect of U.S. society does, including the nation\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nOur analysis revealed that, in many cities, testing sites in and near predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are likely to serve far more patients than those near predominantly white areas.\n\nA similar disparity exists between richer and poorer neighborhoods, our analysis showed: Testing resources were more scarce in poorer areas, with fewer sites per person and sites located farther away. And the disparity could be even greater in real life, considering wealthier people could also get tested by private practitioners who are less likely to be reflected in our analysis.\n\nKevin Ahmaad Jenkins, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics who has been researching the impact of COVID-19 testing center availability on communities of color, told ABC News and FiveThirtyEight that his team found that testing sites serving minority communities in big cities are fewer in number, have longer lines and often run out of tests. The impact of such disparities, he said, is evident in the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate effect on people of color.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just as clear as George Floyd\u2019s video. These numbers are right in front us: We are dying at disproportionate rates,\u201d he said.\n\nTo better understand the extent of this problem, we looked for cities whose broader \u201curbanized area\u201d had at least 1 million residents. (\u201cUrbanized area\u201d is a census designation for cities and the densely populated areas immediately surrounding them.) We then calculated the potential level of demand at each testing site in that area, based on the number of people living nearby and additional sites in the area.\n\nWe assumed that people would want to get tested at nearby sites, so we compared the number of patients a site would serve if the population of each census block group tried to visit sites that were close to them. This value, which we will refer to as potential patient demand, reflects how many people live near a given site and how many other options those people have.\n\nThe disparities we found varied in severity across the country. In some major urbanized areas, they\u2019re small or nonexistent. But in others \u2014 from Dallas to Miami to San Diego and many places in between \u2014 majority-Black and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods faced far more competition for COVID-19 testing than their white neighbors. Disparities were also seen in some predominantly Asian or Pacific Islander communities, such as those in Washington, D.C., Minneapolis and Riverside, Calif., but they weren\u2019t as widespread as those among Black and Hispanic communities.\n\nAnd our calculation of potential demand for testing at some sites in those underserved neighborhoods is likely an underestimation: Based on our reporting, many of the testing sites in those neighborhoods are government-funded community sites. These sites are set up to close the gaps in testing access in different communities, but they tend to be very popular among people from all across the county or urban area because they are often free and don\u2019t require an appointment.\n\nWe used data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2014-18 American Community Survey five-year estimates to figure out if, within urbanized areas, block groups that were majority Black or majority Hispanic were more likely to be close to sites with higher potential patient demand than majority-white block groups. To compare neighborhoods, we created a measure that we call potential community need, which is an average of the potential demand at nearby test sites. We also examined how block groups with a median income in the top 25 percent compared to those with median incomes in the bottom 25 percent.\n\nCastlight\u2019s set of testing site locations is among the most comprehensive data available, but compiling every testing location in the nation is a massive undertaking, as sites are constantly opening, closing and moving. Given that, the data set is likely missing some testing sites. Additionally, our analysis is based on testing site data as of June 18, so many new sites have been added nationwide since then \u2014 and others have likely closed or moved. We conducted separate analyses using a different source of testing site locations and examined other testing-related data to corroborate our findings.\n\nWe\u2019ve highlighted some of the cities with the most emblematic trends below. While we\u2019re confident in the trends we\u2019re presenting, we\u2019d encourage you to think of them more as estimates (akin to a fire marshal\u2019s approximation of the size of a crowd at a political rally) than exact measurements (such as a baseball player\u2019s batting average). For more detail on our methodology, and some of the limitations in the data and thus this analysis, see here.\n\nHowever, this analysis still provides a vivid snapshot of the hurdles, complications and shortfalls in American efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 this summer, a time when increased testing capacity in minority and low-income areas could have slowed the disease \u2014 a point widely acknowledged by public health experts.\n\n\u201cTesting site distribution and capacity is a direct reflection of the inequalities in our existing health care system,\u201d said John Brownstein, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard Medical School whose team of researchers at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Computational Epidemiology Lab also looked into the health care disparities underlying geographic access to testing. \u201cThe lack of access for those most vulnerable to infections will only serve to intensify the impact of this pandemic.\u201d\n\nTEXAS\n\nKenneth Hamilton, 31, had been waiting for four hours in the line to take a COVID-19 test at Houston\u2019s NRG Stadium.\n\nEventually, after spotting several people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, Hamilton \u2014 a small business owner and father of seven \u2014 decided that continuing to wait wasn\u2019t worth the risk of being exposed to coronavirus in the line itself. So he left, and looked for other testing options in his neighborhood.\n\nBut as a Black resident of Houston\u2019s Third Ward, the line Hamilton left was, at the time, his only nearby option. Three months after he first sought a test, he says there are considerably more testing centers in his neighborhood.\n\n\u201cOne of the schools that my kids go to, and one of the schools close by in the neighborhood, and a couple of churches now have them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey ramped up, to an extent.\u201d\n\nThe Houston urbanized area is just as diverse as many other major Texas metropolitan areas, but the city\u2019s initial plans to spread testing centers out equally across its neighborhoods while still operating at capacity helped to reduce site demand. As a result, the community demands of various neighborhoods were fairly equal. ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis showed that, on average, predominantly Black Houston neighborhoods faced similar levels of potential need as white neighborhoods. Hispanic neighborhoods had slightly higher potential community need than white neighborhoods, but not by much.\n\nBut the disparities are still clearly visible in the San Antonio and Dallas areas.\n\nSAN ANTONIO\n\nIn the San Antonio urbanized area, testing sites in poorer, majority-Black and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods in the south, east and west are estimated to have to serve far more people than sites in more affluent, whiter neighborhoods in the north, resulting in a disparity in potential community need.\n\nAccording to our analysis, of the roughly 45 sites that were actively testing in San Antonio in mid-June, several sites with the lowest potential patient demand were concentrated in the northern neighborhoods of Stone Oak and The Dominion, as well as the areas surrounding Friedrich Wilderness Park, which are all majority-white communities that boast median household incomes ranging from around $100,000 to $150,000.\n\nIn comparison, many of the busiest sites are scattered in San Antonio\u2019s more densely populated downtown, where the median income ranged from just $15,000 to about $40,000.\n\nThroughout the San Antonio urbanized area, predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods had an average potential community need twice as large as white neighborhoods; the disparity in between majority-Black and majority-white neighborhoods was even larger.\n\nExperts say that the disparity can be attributed to a long-standing gap in the health care system and an unequal distribution of health care facilities in the San Antonio area, which is one of the most economically segregated cities in the country.\n\nRecognizing testing disparities in different communities, the city identified underserved neighborhoods based on its equity matrix, and put together three cost-free pop-up sites that rotate around different parts of the city every week, according to its health department.\n\nNot only are government sites falling short of their ability to meet the public need for tests, but they themselves have become part of the disparity by concentrating demand even as they seek to address it in underserved neighborhoods. San Antonio\u2019s walk-up sites do not require a doctor\u2019s referral and, as a result, have become massively popular among those who do not otherwise have access to testing.\n\nIn late June, Jennifer Herriott, the deputy director of the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District, told us that people have lined up hours before these pop-up sites even open and that one time they had to turn down 275 people after running out of tests.\n\nHerriott said that as the demand for testing spiked, with cases and hospitalization rates across the state setting new records on an almost daily basis, the city and the county have been working to ramp up testing capacity. The pop-up sites that used to run only three days a week now operate six days a week, and each site\u2019s capacity has been increased from about 150-200 tests per day to 350.\n\nStill, the long lines remain in some places, and sites continue to run out of tests.\n\n\u201cPublic health and our partnership with San Antonio Fire [Department] has consistently had its eye on making sure that we\u2019re serving our Black and brown communities,\u201d Herriott said. \u201cAs our needs increase here, we\u2019ve increased free testing and those walk-ups and the Freeman drive-thru so we make sure that communities that might not be able to access testing are able to access testing.\u201d\n\nDALLAS\n\nDallas County and Tarrant County, two counties of nearly 4.7 million people that cover much of the Dallas urbanized area, have together reported over 64,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus so far. Our data showed that in early summer, the testing infrastructure of the Dallas urbanized area \u2014 which encompasses the cities of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington \u2014 resembled that of San Antonio: Local and state providers, as well as private hospitals, favored people living in whiter and wealthier parts of the county, towards the north, more than those living in the less affluent areas in the south.\n\nAcross the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington urbanized area, our analysis found that majority-Black neighborhoods had a potential community need 46 percent higher than majority-white neighborhoods; majority-Hispanic neighborhoods had a potential need 24 percent higher.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a compounding problem beyond just where the sites are,\u201d said Judge Clay Jenkins, the chief elected official in Dallas County. \u201cThe people that tend to have insurance are in the north and those that tend to not have insurance are in the south. We\u2019ve planned to put the majority of our testing in places where there\u2019s high uninsured.\u201d\n\nTake the University Park neighborhood of Dallas, where the median household income is $214,000 and almost 90 percent of the residents are white. It has at least five testing sites around the neighborhood, according to Castlight data. Appointments are required at most of them, per Castlight, which helps organize the speed at which people are able to get tested every day (walk-in testing centers tend to have longer lines).\n\nIt\u2019s a vastly different situation in Lancaster in southeast Dallas County, which has about 15,000 more residents than University Park but where Black people make up 69 percent of the population and the median household income is $53,000. Residents hoping to get a coronavirus test in the Lancaster area had to travel at least seven miles to the nearest drive-thru testing center until recently, when a nearby Walmart Supercenter opened up a drive-thru site.\n\nTo address the disparities, the city of Dallas asked the private sector to step up its support in the areas of the city most in need of more testing.\n\n\u201cA lot of the private providers are set up in northern Dallas, and it does highlight the existing disparities in the city,\u201d said Tristan Hallman, a spokesman for Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson. \u201cIn response, we\u2019ve asked Walgreens, CVS, Kroger to locate their facilities in southern Dallas, and they\u2019ve done so.\u201d\n\nIndeed, public health experts said the issue of unequal access to testing is a direct result of long-standing decisions made by private-sector companies and entrepreneurs when selecting which neighborhoods to open new businesses in. And the disparity is exacerbated by the fact that underserved communities are less likely to have the health insurance or financial resources necessary to seek costly testing from private providers when community sites are not accessible.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly driven by systematic health care injustice and it\u2019s actually very clearly delineated in Dallas because of gentrification and all of the social aspects of our community,\u201d said Katelyn Jetelina, a professor at the UTHealth School of Public Health in Dallas. \u201cWe need to figure out how to supplement the cost so that families in south Dallas don\u2019t have to decide whether they\u2019re having dinner or have to go get a COVID test.\u201d\n\nEven as more testing sites have been set up in underserved communities, new coronavirus hot spots flared up over the summer as communities began to reopen; now, a lack of tests and long lines have created major problems all over the country.\n\nFurther south, along the border in Hidalgo, Texas, Isaac Garza waited 10 hours in line to get a coronavirus test after visiting several recently reopened restaurants he oversees. As he has diabetes, an underlying condition, he didn\u2019t want to take any chances, and was relieved when his test results came back negative.\n\nBut the limited testing options in his community creates problems for Garza\u2019s staff, too. Every day, Garza said, he receives calls from employees showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 who tell him that they might have to miss critical work hours to wait in line for a test.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been challenging to do business and just to live day in and day out with all this because you\u2019re trying to protect your family, you\u2019re trying to protect your employees,\u201d he said.\n\nPHILADELPHIA\n\nFuneral director John Price, 72, had just gotten a break after a long day picking up bodies of COVID-19 victims from local hospitals in June. So he thought it was the perfect time to get tested himself for the coronavirus.\n\nPrice pulled his car into a line of approximately 300 others waiting for a test at a church parking lot on Cheltenham Avenue in North Philadelphia. Two hours in, he started getting calls from clients who had just lost loved ones to COVID-19. Another hour into his attempt to get a test, Price realized that he just couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\n\n\u201cI had to pull out of the line, because I had people who were calling me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was probably going to be another two or three hours before they got to me. If they got to me.\u201d\n\nHe went another week without getting a COVID-19 test until he stumbled upon a walk-in testing site organized by Dr. Ala Stanford\u2019s Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, which was offering the tests for free.\n\n\u201cA lot of people weren\u2019t notified of how they can actually get testing,\u201d said Price, recalling confusion amongst residents when the outbreak first began in the predominantly Black neighborhood of West Powelton, where his funeral home is based. \u201cIt was more like word of mouth, \u2018Oh this organization is doing it today over here, or so-and-so is doing it today over there.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven today, as the coronavirus crisis intensifies nationally, predominantly Black neighborhoods in the Philadelphia urbanized area, which extends into New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, have fewer testing centers than their wealthier and whiter counterparts.\n\nOther researchers, conducting independent analyses of other data, observed the same phenomenon we did regarding the demands placed on testing sites in majority-white and majority-Black neighborhoods at the city level, despite the fact that Black Philadelphians make up a plurality of COVID-19 test recipients in the city.\n\nDrawing on his own study of access to COVID-19 tests in various Philadelphia neighborhoods, which he has been tracking since the outbreak began, Drexel University epidemiologist Dr. Usama Bilal found that testing disparities are often a product of existing systemic inequalities. Rates of testing, he said, were lower in poorer areas and areas with higher proportions of residents who are racial minorities. Testing access improved throughout the city in April and May, Bilal found, but as cases start to resurface and the demand for tests rises, he worries the city will backslide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been observing that testing access is going the wrong way again,\u201d he said. \u201cTesting is becoming more concentrated in wealthier areas in Philadelphia, and we have observed a similar pattern in Chicago and New York.\u201d\n\nA Philadelphia public health department spokesman denied that testing is increasingly inaccessible to racial minorities and said that the city has been focused on expanding resources in underserved communities, citing services like the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, which recently received city funding to conduct free coronavirus tests.\n\nBut Stanford, the surgeon who heads the consortium, said she worried that as the demand for testing increases nationwide, the share of tests she will be able to offer free of charge will fall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here in the sun, in the rain, doing whatever we can do in a mobile unit begging for supplies from everywhere else in the United States, waiting 10 days to get our results back,\u201d she said. \u201cBut yet, in some of the best hospitals in the nation you have an in-house test that the residents of this city do not uniformly have access to. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the city\u2019s public health department, Philadelphia has conducted more than 166,000 COVID-19 tests. Black residents account for 40 percent of the city\u2019s COVID-19 tests, more than any other racial group tested and about equal to the share of Philadelphia that is Black, per city data.\n\nBilal\u2019s research, however, now finds that in predominantly Black and highly populated areas like the Oxford Circle neighborhood of Philadelphia, where the median household income is $41,000, just 60.9 per every 1,000 people are now getting tested. Compare that to the more affluent and plurality white Center City neighborhoods, where testing rates are now 133 per every 1,000 people, according to Bilal.\n\n\u201cThe epidemic that we really need to control long term is social inequality,\u201d said Bilal as the coronavirus outbreak in Philadelphia first took hold. \u201cIt has many different intersecting axes. So there is racism: that is places, that is classism, that is gender discrimination, there are many, many things going on there.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Philadelphia area illustrates the extent to which disparities in coronavirus testing access grow out of systemic inequality in American society. Philadelphia is one of the poorest big cities in the nation, with about 25 percent of residents living below the poverty line. Bilal found that while the distribution of testing sites in Philadelphia has vastly improved from where it was at the beginning of the outbreak \u2014 with multiple options now available for residents in even the poorest areas \u2014 Black Americans in many low-income areas are still likely to find it difficult to get a COVID-19 test. Our analysis of the sites active in mid-June confirmed this.\n\nIn Kingsessing, a southwestern neighborhood that\u2019s around 80 percent Black, there\u2019s only one COVID-19 testing site, and that site has limited testing hours. Meanwhile, in the Center City area, there are several sites \u2014 some within a short walking distance of each other.\n\nAs is the situation in Philadelphia, many cities are now responding to calls to provide more resources to communities of color by increasing the number of pop-up sites to accommodate residents and ease the demand for more tests.\n\nSOUTH FLORIDA\n\nMartin Torres waited seven hours in line for a COVID-19 test at Hard Rock Stadium, an open-air venue best known as the home of the Miami Dolphins, while showing what he believed to be symptoms of the virus. When he finally reached the front, he was told he\u2019d get results back in five days.\n\nTwo weeks later, he is still waiting.\n\n\u201cI am kind of in a limbo waiting for when I can have a response for that,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nIn a statement responding to the demand in testing and the slower turnaround times, Quest Diagnostics, one of the major labs processing COVID-19 tests, said it will \u201ccontinue to ramp up capacity to reach 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests a day.\u201d\n\nFlorida, where the pandemic has recently spiked to nearly 370,000 confirmed cases, expanded testing capacity in response to problems surrounding testing access equity. But being a resident of a lower-income neighborhood still presents a challenge in terms of getting a COVID-19 test.\n\nThe South Florida region, which the census refers to as the Miami urbanized area, contains at least part of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, and has deep disparities in testing site availability in majority-Black, majority-Hispanic and majority-white neighborhoods, according to our analysis.\n\nThe neighborhoods included in the Miami urbanized area also have massive economic inequality, and disparities exist within different Hispanic communities. Yet the few testing sites in wealthy areas \u2014 such as Cooper City, a majority-white town located in Broward County just north of Miami-Dade \u2014 had a much smaller potential patient demand than sites in many of the more densely populated lower-income neighborhoods, many of which are majority Black or Hispanic.\n\nOn average, majority-Black areas had a potential community need 13 percent larger than majority-white census blocks. In majority-Hispanic areas, it was 29 percent larger, with the densely populated, predominantly Hispanic areas around South Miami showing a particularly high potential need.\n\nJust 10 miles south of Cooper City is Miami Gardens, a predominantly Black area in Miami-Dade County where the median household income is less than half that of Cooper City. If residents there want to get a test, they have to travel to Hard Rock Stadium and wait in a line that officials have advised could be as long as four hours in a summer heat that sometimes nears 100 degrees.\n\nThe long lines cause other problems, too. On most days at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site, it is not uncommon for testing to temporarily pause due to lightning in the area or because a car waiting in line breaks down due to mechanical issues.\n\n\u201cWe have seen cars run out of gas at some of the busier test sites, but we tell people that a little bit of planning and a lot of patience are required,\u201d said Mike Jachals, a state spokesman for several of the federally supported testing sites across the state.\n\nIn an emailed statement to ABC News and FiveThirtyEight, a state emergency management spokesman said Florida \u201cis continuing to increase COVID-19 testing daily.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said the county has made \u201ca concerted effort\u201d to put more testing facilities in lower-income communities throughout the county. As part of that effort, new pop-up sites at the Joseph Caleb Center in central Miami and Harris Field Park in south Miami-Dade, both located in predominantly Black or Hispanic areas, have been installed.\n\nIn Miramar, a city of about 140,000 just north of the Hard Rock Stadium, there\u2019s only one public COVID-19 testing center even though it happens to be the city with one of the largest percentages of Black people in Broward County. The city received the state funding necessary to open its first state-supported testing site just over a month ago, which local officials believe was far too late.\n\n\u201cInitially, I was very concerned, very upset,\u201d said Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam in response to a question about the lack of urgency in establishing testing facilities in the city. \u201cIt was very disappointing and upsetting, but I was actually happy once we did get the call notifying me that we would have the site and since that determination was made, we\u2019ve made the best of that site. It would have been ideal to have it up since the onset.\u201d\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA\n\nAfter touting a massive expansion of testing and stable case counts earlier this summer, California has in recent weeks been rolling back on its earlier promise of easy access to testing for every resident.\n\nCoronavirus hot spots in Southern California, in particular, are now putting back restrictions on community testing to prioritize symptomatic patients or those most at risk, such as nursing home residents and staff members.\n\nBased on ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis and reporting, communities of color and lower income-level neighborhoods in the San Diego and Los Angeles urbanized areas \u2014 where some of the biggest gaps in potential community need were seen between majority-white and majority-Black neighborhoods \u2014 are expected to suffer the most from the testing restrictions.\n\nAccording to our analysis of site locations in mid-June, in both the San Diego and Los Angeles areas, majority-Black neighborhoods were estimated to have around 30 percent higher potential need than majority-white neighborhoods.\n\nSAN DIEGO\n\nIn the San Diego urbanized area, much of which falls within the coastal section of San Diego County, many of the sites with lower potential patient demand are located in the predominantly white and wealthy neighborhoods along the northern part of the coast, while the sites expected to serve more people were all in the poorer, predominantly Black communities in the southern end of the city of San Diego.\n\nMost of the community sites in San Diego County, which tend to be busier than private sites, are by appointment, county Health and Human Services Agency spokesperson Tim McClain said, and with the recent spike in cases people have had to make appointments a week or more in advance.\n\nThat was the case for Holly Young, who lives in La Mesa, a suburb just east of the city of San Diego. Young, 60, said she sought testing earlier this month after she discovered that her son and his girlfriend had been in contact with a COVID-positive friend prior to seeing her.\n\nShe said her health care provider was unable to test her because she didn\u2019t show any symptoms, so she turned to a county testing site, for which she had to wait almost 10 days just to book an appointment and then drive an hour and 15 minutes to get to the site.\n\n\u201cI am in an essential industry, and part of my job is making the bank deposits, going to the post office and other routine tasks that were outside the business,\u201d said Young, who is a self-employed accountant with clients in retail. \u201cSo even though I was always masked, I still felt very vulnerable. I\u2019m overweight, take blood pressure medication and I smoked for 20 years, so I am not at all confident I would survive COVID-19.\u201d\n\nYoung was tested on July 11, and told she\u2019ll get her results in five to seven business days. But she went off a two-week self-quarantine last Thursday, meaning she had to return to work before getting her test results.\n\nThe disparity in access to tests hasn\u2019t been lost on Young, who said she is on Obamacare and does not get health care from her job: \u201cWe all know people who just call their doctor and get a test the next day. It shouldn\u2019t be this way.\u201d\n\nMcClain said San Diego County is exceeding state guidelines and offers widespread free and public testing access, but intends to do more to meet increasing public demand and reach deeper into at-risk communities. As of July 6, the county was surpassing the state goal of 4,950 daily tests \u2014 1.5 tests per day per every 1,000 residents \u2014 by 56 percent.\n\n\u201cAs tests became more widely available in spring, the county placed the greatest concentration of testing in our communities of diversity, and those near the border, and continues to bring more sites online,\u201d McClain said. \u201cTesting access is widely dispersed but we intend to make it more convenient with new locations, will add sites to address hotspots and will bring more no-appointment locations online.\u201d\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nThe Los Angeles area has also managed to at least narrow some of the disparities. The poorer urban centers of Los Angeles were estimated to have greater community need than the relatively wealthier suburbs outside the city, as well as in Pasadena, though to a lesser degree.\n\nSince California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an aggressive expansion of the statewide testing capacity back in late April, the state has also significantly ramped up testing in underserved communities, setting up close to 100 state-supported community sites in its communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods. According to our analysis, predominantly Asian communities actually had less potential demand than other groups, including white neighborhoods.\n\nThat expansion appears to have helped collapse testing disparities in the region, according to our analysis of testing data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\n\nAt the end of April, mostly white cities and communities in Los Angeles County had, on average, more than 1,200 tests completed per 100,000 people. That was more than 65 percent more completed tests than communities of color.\n\nAfter Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced free COVID-19 testing for everyone in the county and expanded testing operations, the number of tests administered tripled.\n\nA month later, the racial testing gap had shrunk to just 24 percent between the most-white areas and the least white. About 6,200 tests per 100,000 people were completed in whiter areas and about 5,000 tests per 100,000 people in less white areas, according to the analysis of the city\u2019s testing data.\n\nThere was a similar pattern in wealthier and poorer areas. At the end of April, people were tested at a rate 60 percent higher in areas where the median household income was in the top quartile versus the bottom quartile. But by May 31, that gap had shrunk to just 13 percent.\n\nSince April, California has scaled up its statewide testing capacity from just 2,000 tests per day to more than 100,000 now, and has completed nearly 4.8 million tests since the pandemic began, the state\u2019s health department spokesperson told ABC News and FiveThirtyEight.\n\nAs cases and hospitalizations hit new records in the past couple weeks, however, the state is again struggling with testing capacity. The governor last week issued a new advisory to hospitals and labs, asking them to prioritize testing turnaround for individuals who are most at risk of spreading the virus to others, including those in nursing homes and congregate living settings.\n\nThe Castlight data analysis has helped shed light on the racial, ethnic and income disparities in the allocation of COVID-19 testing resources, and ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s reporting shows how gaps created by systemic inequity in the health care system continue to persist even as states, cities and counties step up efforts to address them.\n\nAs cases rise and states across the country begin to face testing constraints, more local governments and private providers say they are considering going back to prioritizing testing access to symptomatic patients and those most at risk. In some places, such as Sacramento, Calif., and Omaha, Neb., testing sites are even closing because of supply shortages. This is expected to create additional strain on testing for underserved communities as state or county-sponsored public sites and labs further limit testing access.\n\n\u201cOur response to COVID is a reflection of the existing biases we have in our healthcare system,\u201d said John Brownstein, the epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWhile governments are trying to close the gap, we still have a long way to go to make sure Americans have equal access to testing resources.\u201d\n\nFor Dr. Ala Stanford and her colleagues at the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium in Philadelphia, the choice early on was clear: adjust to a new normal of life indoors, or move swiftly to implement testing on the streets of Philadelphia to combat a virus that was proving deadly to Black communities.\n\nStanford says she felt compelled to respond as she did because she knew that the same health care disparities she learned about in medical school, and as a practicing doctor, were still at play in Philadelphia during the coronavirus crisis \u2014 the city in which she\u2019s spent her entire life.\n\n\u201cI stopped and said to myself: I\u2019m a business owner in private practice, I have access, I can order these lab kits like anybody else, I know where the people are that are hurting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am not afraid to go there.\u201d\n\nABC News\u2019 Briana Stewart and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Rachael Dottle contributed reporting.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-neighborhoods-have-more-access-to-covid-19-testing-sites/", "author": ["Soo Rin Kim", "Matthew Vann", "Laura Bronner", "Grace Manthey"]}, {"title": "How We Analyzed 7,914 COVID-19 Testing Sites And Found Racial Disparities", "text": "For our story on the distribution of COVID-19 testing sites, we wanted to develop a measure of how busy coronavirus testing sites were likely to be.

One central point of tension: the $600-per-week supplemental unemployment insurance benefit that was enacted in March as part of the CARES Act and is set to expire on July 31.\n\nDemocrats have proposed extending the payment until jobless rates in states fall below a certain threshold. Republicans, meanwhile, are leery of continuing the full payments, saying they will discourage people from returning to work. And it\u2019s true that research has shown that many workers are making more money on the beefed-up benefits than they would be at their old jobs.\n\nBut in the latest installment of our regular survey of quantitative macroeconomic economists, conducted in partnership with the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, the 33 economists in our study collectively thought there was a 59 percent chance that either keeping the payment steady or increasing it to above $600 per week would be most beneficial to the economy. They said there was about a 33 percent chance that reducing the weekly payment to less than $600 would most benefit the economy, and only a 7 percent chance that letting the program completely lapse would be most beneficial. This makes sense considering that another recent IGM survey found that most economists blamed high unemployment on companies that weren\u2019t hiring \u2014 not on people choosing not to work because of unemployment payments.\n\nJonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University who has been consulting with FiveThirtyEight on the design of the survey, pointed out that some extension of unemployment insurance is important because many workers are still out of a job. States can continue to offer benefits regardless of what the federal government does, but those don\u2019t last forever, either \u2014 and some states are less generous than others.\n\nHow should Congress handle unemployment insurance? Likelihood that each federal policy choice would most benefit the entire economy over the rest of 2020, according to economists Option Probability Keep the weekly payment at $600 37% Reduce the weekly payment to less than $600 33 Increase the weekly payment to more than $600 22 Allow federal pandemic unemployment insurance to completely lapse 7 The survey of 33 economists was conducted July 17-20. Source: FIVETHIRTYEIGHT/IGM COVID-19 ECONOMIC SURVEY\n\nOf course, the perspectives on Congress\u2019s response are nuanced, and many of the economists think the benefits should ideally be phased out as the economy improves, assuming there are no logistical hurdles. When we drilled into some of the ways that federal policymakers could aid jobless workers, the experts thought there was a 37 percent chance that the best strategy would be to continue paying jobless workers $600 weekly for now but peg federal unemployment benefits to key economic indicators so they become gradually less generous as the economy improves. They said there was a 26 percent chance it would benefit the economy more if the workers were paid less than $600 per week for a fixed period of time, and a 22 percent probability that it would be better to continue paying jobless workers $600 a week even if it meant some would make more than they did while working.\n\nDeborah Lucas, an economist at MIT, said she would opt for temporarily leaving the weekly payment at $600, or even increasing it a bit, although she said the payments should ramp down if the economy improved enough. \u201cThe fact that a considerable number of people are making more this way than when they were working seems like a good thing,\u201d she said, adding that this will only be true for low earners, who might otherwise feel pressure to take jobs that would endanger their health. \u201cIn effect, it enhances social insurance protections and is a step towards universal basic income, both policies I think would improve social welfare even in the absence of a pandemic.\u201d\n\nNot all of the economists were a fan of expanding or maintaining the $600 weekly payment, though. Annette Vissing-J\u00f8rgensen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said it was fundamentally unfair that some essential workers were making less money than nonessential workers who were out of a job. She added that while she\u2019s concerned overall about making it more financially attractive for workers to stay home from their jobs, particularly if hiring starts to pick up again, there \u201ccould be a role for continuing some level of extra benefits\u201d in states that are less generous. Others noted that while the extra payment made sense as a short-term stimulus measure, economists might approach the long-term consequences of such a generous supplement differently.\n\nStill, it was notable that the least popular response to the question above was an alternative to the $600-per-week payment that\u2019s been floated by some Republicans, who have proposed a \u201cback to work bonus\u201d for people who return to their jobs instead of continuing to supplement workers\u2019 unemployment benefits. Economists thought there was only a 16 percent chance this would do the most to benefit the economy.\n\n\u201cContinued unemployment support has the twin benefits of alleviating poverty for jobless workers and sustaining consumer demand in the economy,\u201d said Allan Timmermann, professor of finance and economics at the University of California, San Diego. Timmermann has also been consulting with us on the survey. \u201c[It] is viewed as a highly effective tool to prevent the economy from stalling.\u201d\n\nAlong similar lines, we asked economists how they would allocate $1 trillion in a hypothetical COVID-19 stimulus package if they wanted to do the most good for the entire economy (with the assumption that the health crisis itself would be addressed with a separate bill). The economists ranked their top three priorities and gave unemployment insurance the highest share of No. 1 responses. But though that benefit was in the top three of priorities for a majority of the experts, at 67 percent, it didn\u2019t see the highest share of overall top-three responses. By that measure, the clear priority according to economists was funding state and local governments \u2014 which is consistent with a previous survey in which they thought one of the most likely causes of economic disaster would be an unwillingness to bail out those governments. In this week\u2019s survey, 85 percent of respondents thought that should be among lawmakers\u2019 top three priorities, and 36 percent said it should be No. 1.\n\nWhat should be the priorities of a federal stimulus?

So cushioning states and localities could do a lot to support the economy, he said.\n\nOther areas of focus that frequently came up among the economists\u2019 top three priorities were funding for small businesses (48 percent) and public K-12 schools (45 percent) and another round of individual stimulus checks (36 percent). None of our economists, however, thought funding either large corporations or colleges and other institutions of higher learning was a priority.\n\nIn addition to our usual questions about gross domestic product in the second and fourth quarters, we asked the economists to forecast third-quarter real GDP growth in this installment of the survey. The results shed some light on just how much the prospect of a true \u201csecond wave\u201d of coronavirus in the winter could slow down economic growth.\n\nOn average, economists thought real GDP in the second quarter of 2020 \u2014 which ended June 30, with an advance GDP estimate set to be released later this month \u2014 declined by an annualized rate of 27 percent compared with the first quarter. They also thought real GDP would grow by about 8 percentage points quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter, with an upper-bound estimate of 17 percent and little chance of negative growth again. But their forecasts looked bleaker for the fourth quarter, with a median forecast of 3 percent growth, a 90th-percentile forecast of 9 percent and a 10th-percentile forecast in the red again (at -3 percent) \u2014 all more pessimistic than in the third quarter.\n\nSome of that reflects the increased economic activity of the summer (relative to the early spring), even with the virus circulating around the country; the likelihood of some kind of third-quarter bounce back was high, given how bad economists think second-quarter GDP will end up. But the forecast also speaks to the uncertain course that the virus \u2014 and therefore, the economy \u2014 might take over the rest of 2020.\n\nRobert Barbera, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said part of the problem in forecasting quarterly shifts is that month-to-month change can be so extreme. His forecast for the third quarter was less optimistic because he expected most of the initial bounce back to happen in May and June, which are both part of the second quarter. The third quarter might see an uptick in August and September and look quite a bit better than the second quarter, he said, but that\u2019s partially because the second quarter was so bad. Predicting the fourth quarter is even more difficult \u2014 in part because a bounce back in the economy is so dependent on Americans\u2019 willingness to resume ordinary life.\n\nHowever the course of the recession plays out, our economists think America could be due for a massive wave of personal bankruptcies in the second half of the year. During the first half of 2020, total bankruptcy filings \u2014 the vast majority of which were by individuals \u2014 were actually down 23 percent relative to the first half of 2019, according to court data from Epiq AACER. But don\u2019t be fooled: That was almost certainly because of the heavy use of grace periods and extensions by creditors, which will eventually expire (if they haven\u2019t already). In our survey, 67 percent of economists thought total filings would increase significantly in the second half of 2020 relative to the second half of 2019; only 6 percent thought they would see the same kind of year-over-year decrease in the second half of 2020 that they saw in the first half.\n\nTaken as a whole, the economic picture painted by this week\u2019s survey is no brighter than in previous installments. The panel\u2019s predictions for future GDP have scarcely budged over the past two weeks, and the experts remain wary that whatever gains the economy is making over the summer could be wiped out by the virus before year\u2019s end. But they also clearly think Congress has a few tools at its disposal to avoid making the recovery harder than it needs to be. The big question is \u2014 will policymakers use them?", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/economists-think-congress-should-keep-paying-unemployed-workers-600-a-week-or-even-more/", "author": ["Neil Paine", "Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "At Long Last, Baseball\u2019s (Almost) Back", "text": "We start with our preview of the 2020 MLB season. However abbreviated, and however shaky the runup, baseball is back! And it looks \u2026 pretty similar to how we thought it would look. Our model favors the Houston Astros and the New York Yankees in the American League (with Sara\u2019s beloved Minnesota Twins close behind), and the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Washington Nationals lead the National League. While we\u2019ve lost the luxury of a long season, in which a single game doesn\u2019t matter quite so much, we are excited by how close the race for the playoffs might be all the way to the end. At least on paper, the Dodgers are the favorites, with a 20 percent chance to win the World Series, and we\u2019re all excited to see what kind of a difference Mookie Betts will make for them. But the potential for something wild to happen is also high, and it would only take a string of eight or nine wins to boost a team that looks bad now into playoff contention. Everyone remains skeptical of the Mets\u2019 chances, though, so at least we still have some constants.\n\nNext, we welcome FiveThirtyEight contributor Bria Felicien to take us through the highs and lows of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League Challenge Cup. The quarterfinals of the tournament saw a number of upsets, including the absolutely loaded North Carolina Courage being denied by the Portland Thorns and their stacked bench of incredible goalies. In fact, the goalkeepers have really been the stars of the tournament, with keepers like Kailen Sheridan, Jane Campbell and Britt Eckerstrom keeping pace with the USWNT\u2019s starter, Alyssa Naeher. Now that the Courage have been eliminated, Bria is just rooting for some goals and some drama. But the success of the Challenge Cup \u2014 not to mention the just-announced addition of a Los Angeles-based team \u2014 pretty much ensures that the league will serve up more of both.\n\nFinally, FiveThirtyEight senior visual journalist Anna Wiederkehr joins to explore the wild world of Fastest Known Time trail running \u2014 which is exactly what it sounds like. Big city races are off the cards for 2020, which helps explain the explosion in runners trying to clock the fastest known time traversing everything from the Appalachian Trail to the road through Central Park. There\u2019s a staggering amount of logistics and planning \u2014 and potentially water purification \u2014 involved in trying to record an FKT, but it\u2019s proved to be a great way for endurance athletes to stay fit during the pandemic.\n\nWhat we\u2019re looking at this week:", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-long-last-baseballs-almost-back/", "author": ["Sarah Shachat"]}, {"title": "We\u2019re Looking For A Podcast Producer For PODCAST-19", "text": "FiveThirtyEight is seeking a part-time producer for our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19.

But The Astros And Yankees Are Favorites In The American League \u2026 Again.", "text": "Baseball Will Be Weird This Year. But The Astros And Yankees Are Favorites In The American League \u2026 Again.\n\nWhen Major League Baseball finally starts its 2020 season on July 23, it will be a very different kind of campaign than any we\u2019ve seen in our lifetimes. Not only will it be much shorter than usual (60 games per team instead of 162) and feature a strange mix of division and interleague matchups, but it comes against the backdrop of a pandemic that continues to ravage the nation, which has caused players to question the wisdom of playing \u2014 or opt out of the season entirely.\n\nAnd yet, MLB is back \u2014 and so are our predictions. To help make sense of the favorites and dark horses in this strange mini-season, we plugged the shortened schedule into our forecast model and simulated it 100,000 times, tracking each team\u2019s expected record and its odds of winning the division or the World Series. Here\u2019s what our model thinks of the 2020 American League:\n\nHow Elo is forecasting the AL East race Avg. Simulated Season Chance to\u2026 Team Elo Rating Wins Losses Run Diff. Make Playoffs Win Division Win World Series Yankees 1571 36 24 +58 78% 56% 14% Rays 1539 33 27 +31 56 28 5 Red Sox 1511 30 30 +4 29 12 1 Blue Jays 1479 27 33 -22 13 4 <1 Orioles 1412 21 39 -85 <1 <1 <1 Based on 100,000 simulations of the 2020 MLB season. Sources: Baseball prospectus, Fangraphs, Clay Davenport\n\nLast year\u2019s AL East was supposed to see a tight race between the defending champs in Boston and their bitterest of rivals in the Bronx. Instead, the New York Yankees overcame a rash of injuries to pull away for the division crown in the second half \u2014 and our model thinks the Bombers are clear East favorites again in 2020. New York added ace Gerrit Cole via free agency, which shores up a rotation that ranked just 16th in total wins above replacement, but an even bigger factor might be improved health for a club that saw players spend 3,192 total days on the injured list in 2019 \u2014 36 percent more than any other team. If Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Gary Sanchez, Aaron Hicks and Miguel Andujar can stay intact over the short schedule, the Yankees will be a major championship threat.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays gave New York a good fight early last season and were also a thorn in the Houston Astros\u2019 side during the postseason. Maybe we should stop being surprised when they sneak up on much more expensive contenders every year! Losing Tommy Pham will hurt some in 2020, but this remains one of the best and most balanced teams in MLB (particularly if ace Blake Snell bounces back to his 2018 form). We think they\u2019ll be nearly as good as the Yankees, with a 56 percent shot at the playoffs.\n\n[Related: 60 Games Aren\u2019t Enough To Crown The Best MLB Team. But Neither Are 162 Games.]\n\nThat\u2019s better than our outlook for the Boston Red Sox, who had a terrible championship hangover last year and figure to take another step backward after firing manager Alex Cora in January, trading star right fielder Mookie Betts in February and watching ace Chris Sale undergo Tommy John surgery in March. Boston still has plenty of top-end talent (Xander Bogaerts, Rafael Devers, J.D. Martinez) but also enough flaws that a run at the Yankees and Rays looks unlikely.\n\nAnd the Red Sox could have competition from behind in the form of the Toronto Blue Jays, whose young core of Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Cavan Biggio and Bo Bichette should keep pushing the team\u2019s rebuild forward. After acquiring Hyun-Jin Ryu, Tanner Roark and Chase Anderson to improve what was a bottom-five rotation by WAR, don\u2019t be surprised if Toronto makes a run at .500.\n\nFinally, the Baltimore Orioles should bring up the rear for a fourth straight season. With Jonathan Villar and Dylan Bundy now gone, the biggest question might be whether they\u2019ll crack 20 wins in 60 games against the toughest schedule in baseball \u2014 we project them at just 21 wins for the season, the fewest of any team.\n\nHow Elo is forecasting the AL Central race Avg. Simulated Season Chance to\u2026 Team Elo Rating Wins Losses Run Diff. Make Playoffs Win Division Win World Series Twins 1544 35 25 +42 67% 48% 7% Indians 1529 33 27 +29 55 34 4 White Sox 1496 30 30 +1 28 14 <1 Royals 1448 25 35 -43 5 2 <1 Tigers 1436 24 36 -53 3 1 <1 Based on 100,000 simulations of the 2020 MLB season. Sources: Baseball prospectus, Fangraphs, Clay Davenport\n\nThe Minnesota Twins were one of baseball\u2019s best stories in 2019, winning the AL Central as preseason underdogs and breaking the all-time single-season home run record in the process. Can they do it again? Well, we won\u2019t know about the home run part without more information about how \u201cjuiced\u201d the 2020 ball is. But in terms of division odds, Minnesota is still the favorite, if by a somewhat slim margin. The Twins didn\u2019t rest on their offseason laurels, adding the likes of Josh Donaldson, Kenta Maeda and Homer Bailey without losing too much of note. But they will also probably regress to the mean after an unusually healthy season that saw their record improve by a whopping 23 games. The question will be how well the offseason activity \u2014 and 2020\u2019s easiest schedule \u2014 helps counterbalance that regression.\n\nFighting to reclaim their old spot atop the division will be the Cleveland Indians, who let the Central slip away after three straight first-place finishes. The 2019 Indians weren\u2019t bad, but they weren\u2019t the elite club they\u2019d been just a few years earlier; despite a star-filled lineup, they scored fewer runs than the AL average and never mounted a big charge after briefly catching the Twins in August. Our model thinks the Tribe still has a 34 percent shot at the division crown, despite losing World Series-era mainstays Corey Kluber, Jason Kipnis and Danny Salazar over the offseason, but the window might be closing on the Francisco Lindor era soon.\n\n[Related: Our 2020 MLB Predictions]\n\nThe Chicago White Sox are a hot breakout pick heading into 2020, primarily because all the young talent they\u2019ve accumulated over the years has finally arrived. Third baseman Yoan Moncada and starter Lucas Giolito took big leaps last season, while left fielder Eloy Jim\u00e9nez and maybe even highly touted Cuban prospect Luis Robert seem poised to do the same this year. Add in offseason additions Yasmani Grandal and Edwin Encarnacion, and the Pale Hose should improve a lot on their .447 winning percentage from a season ago, even if it might not translate to a playoff berth quite yet.\n\nAs for the Kansas City Royals and Detroit Tigers, both clubs figure to be deep in rebuilding mode yet again this year. Detroit actually made some offseason additions \u2014 Ivan Nova, Cameron Maybin, Jonathan Schoop, C.J. Cron, Austin Romine \u2014 that could lead to greater respectability this year. (Then again, it would have been hard to be less respectable than the 2019 Tigers were.) For their part, the Royals mostly treaded water. But our forecast thinks both teams should avoid challenging the Orioles for the mantle of MLB\u2019s worst team, which is a welcome improvement from 2019, even if true contention is still far off in the future.\n\nHow Elo is forecasting the AL West race Avg. Simulated Season Chance to\u2026 Team Elo Rating Wins Losses Run Diff. Make Playoffs Win Division Win World Series Astros 1570 36 24 +55 77% 59% 14% Athletics 1527 32 28 +19 44 22 3 Angels 1503 29 31 -5 24 11 1 Rangers 1484 28 32 -18 16 6 <1 Mariners 1446 24 36 -53 3 1 <1 Based on 100,000 simulations of the 2020 MLB season. Sources: Baseball prospectus, Fangraphs, Clay Davenport\n\nRemember the Houston Astros? Sure, a lot of more important things have happened in the country since it was revealed that Houston engaged in a systematic sign-stealing scheme that left their 2017 title tainted, their manager and GM fired and the entire baseball world vowing revenge. But the Astros\u2019 scandal hasn\u2019t gone anywhere \u2014 and neither have the Astros themselves. Houston is still MLB\u2019s third-most talented team according to our Elo ratings, headlined by the usual suspects: Justin Verlander, Alex Bregman, George Springer, Jose Altuve, Yordan Alvarez, Michael Brantley, Zack Greinke, etc., etc. They also have a steady hand at the helm in veteran manager Dusty Baker. Although the Astros probably had the roughest offseason of any team (maybe ever?), losing Cole and several other key contributors on top of the cheating fallout, we give them a 77 percent chance of returning to the postseason, a 59 percent chance of winning the AL West and a 14 percent World Series probability \u2014 tied with the Yankees for the second-best of any team.\n\nBut if Houston does take a step back, the Oakland Athletics are right there waiting in the wings. Oakland won 97 games for the second straight season in 2019 on the strength of superstar performances from Marcus Semien and Matt Chapman \u2014 the rare pair of 7+ WAR teammates in MLB history \u2014 the solid play of Matt Olson, and unheralded contributions from the likes of Mark Canha, Ramon Laureano and Liam Hendrix. All of those guys will return for 2020, and while Brett Anderson, Bailey and Roark departed in the offseason, a talent pipeline that includes starters Jesus Luzardo and A.J. Puk and catcher Sean Murphy should help the A\u2019s once again vie for a playoff appearance.\n\n[Related: How Our MLB Predictions Work]\n\nComing up behind them, the Los Angeles Angels are one of 2020\u2019s most intriguing teams. We all know about Mike Trout, but the offseason additions of ex-Cubs manager Joe Maddon, third baseman Anthony Rendon \u2014 perhaps Trout\u2019s best-ever teammate \u2014 and pitchers Bundy and Julio Teheran, plus Shohei Ohtani\u2019s return to two-way play, give Los Angeles plenty of upside. (Health permitting for some, obviously.) We still give the Halos just a 24 percent chance at the postseason, in part because they\u2019ll face MLB\u2019s ninth-hardest schedule, but they do have the talent to potentially make some noise.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Texas Rangers are another team capable of making the contenders work for every victory. Last year, the club won 78 games under new manager Chris Woodward and hung around the playoff race for a half-season, despite one of its best players (Joey Gallo) missing 92 games. Then Texas spent the offseason adding a few potentially useful names \u2014 Corey Kluber, Robinson Chirinos, Todd Frazier, etc. \u2014 to help christen a new ballpark. Of course, the 2019 Rangers also got very lucky, both in terms of beating their underlying stats and getting unexpectedly great years from 30-something starters Mike Minor and Lance Lynn. We rank them fourth in the division, though they are an interesting fourth at least.\n\nAnd the Seattle Mariners are projected for last place, which is also where they ended up last season after cooling from an inexplicably red-hot start. Seattle has suffered from tremendously bad luck in its MLB-leading 18-year playoff drought, but our model gives that streak little chance of ending anytime soon. The joy and (mostly) tragedy of Seattle baseball was well-documented by SB Nation\u2019s Jon Bois and Alex Rubenstein in their excellent six-part video series this year about the team\u2019s history; it will probably end up being the highlight of 2020 for the Mariners and their fans.\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/baseball-will-be-weird-this-year-but-the-astros-and-yankees-are-favorites-in-the-american-league-again/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "Secret Trump Voters Didn\u2019t Decide 2016 And Probably Won\u2019t Swing 2020", "text": "A recent poll showed that the majority of Pennsylvanians think people in their community secretly support President Trump.

Hand sanitizer is a bulwark that allows my kids to play on an otherwise empty jungle gym. I believe the backyard has magical properties that will, probably, make it just safe enough to see people and talk to them. In the sun and fresh breeze, we give each other air hugs from six-ish feet away.\n\nMeanwhile, my hair grows, untrimmed, past my clavicle. When my friend, in some ways far more stringent on her social distancing and mask wearing than I am, told me about going in for her first cut since March, I winced involuntarily. I assume it\u2019s roughly the same face that she made when I confessed my masked trip to a clothing store to buy some summer dresses. Both of us know the safest thing \u2014 the thing most likely to prevent the spread of COVID-19 \u2014 would be to stay at home, alone. But we know we won\u2019t do that now. Can\u2019t do it. The idea of sticking with the safest thing has become almost as unthinkable as indulging in the danger of a movie in a theater or a drink at the bar. But in between those extremes, life has become a sticky bog in which we wade through evidence and convenience, hoping we\u2019re stepping on solid ground.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nWe can\u2019t live like we did before coronavirus. We won\u2019t live like we did immediately after it appeared, either. Instead, we\u2019re in the muddy middle, faced with choices that seem at once crucial and impossible, simple and massively complicated. These choices are an everyday occurrence, but they also carry a moral weight that makes them feel different than picking a pasta sauce or a pair of shoes. In a pandemic that\u2019s been filled with unanswerable questions and unwinnable wars, this is our daily Kobayashi Maru. And no one can tell us exactly what we ought to do.\n\nNot that there haven\u2019t been attempts at providing structure.\n\nRight now, you can go online and find multiple charts that will visually categorize what were once the activities of daily life by risk level. Some of these charts are evidence based, compiled by experts and (in my opinion) genuinely helpful. I particularly liked the one designed by epidemiologist Saskia Popescu and bioethecist Ezekiel Emanuel because it lays out not just the risk levels of various behaviors \u2014 getting a haircut, visiting the dentist, buying a new shirt \u2014 but also the underlying factors that can make an activity more or less risky. In general, research has shown that indoors is riskier than outside, long visits riskier than short ones, crowds riskier than individuals \u2014 and, look, just avoid situations where you\u2019re being sneezed, yelled, coughed or sung at.\n\nBut the trouble with the muddy middle is that a general idea of what is riskier isn\u2019t the same thing as a clear delineation between right and wrong. These charts \u2014 even the best ones \u2014 aren\u2019t absolute arbiters of safety: They\u2019re the result of surveying experts. In the case of Popescu\u2019s chart, the risk categorizations were assigned based on discussions among herself, Emanuel and Dr. James P. Phillips, the chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University Emergency Medicine. They each independently assigned a risk level to each activity, and then hashed out the ones on which they disagreed.\n\nTake golf. How safe is it to go out to the links? Initially, the three experts had different risk levels assigned to this activity because they were all making different assumptions about what a game of golf naturally involved, Popescu said. \u201cAre people doing it alone? If not, how many people are in a cart? Are they wearing masks? Are they drinking? \u2026. those little variables that can increase the risk,\u201d she told me.\n\nGolf isn\u2019t just golf. It\u2019s how you golf that matters.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nThose variables and assumptions aren\u2019t trivial to calculating risk. Nor are they static. There\u2019s different muck under your boggy feet in different parts of the country, at different times. For instance, how safe is it to eat outdoors with friends? Popescu\u2019s chart ranks \u201coutdoor picnic or porch dining\u201d with people outside your household as low risk \u2014 a very validating categorization, personally. But a chart produced by the Texas Medical Association, based on a survey of its 53,000 physician members, rates \u201cattending a backyard barbeque\u201d as a moderate risk, a 5 on a scale in which 9 is the stuff most of us have no problem eschewing.\n\nWhen we first noticed this apparent contradiction at FiveThirtyEight, some of us joked about how maybe a Texas barbecue wasn\u2019t the same thing as a picnic in New York or Minnesota. Ha ha, everything\u2019s bigger in Texas, even the guest list. But, come to find out, yeah, that\u2019s actually exactly the deal.\n\n[Related: How To Make Indoor Air Safer]\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of social distancing. And different sauce,\u201d said Mark Casanova, a Dallas palliative care specialist and member of the Texas Medical Association\u2019s COVID-19 task force, summing up what makes a Texas barbecue different. When he rated a backyard barbecue, he was thinking of a crowded event, where people roam from indoors to out and back again, and masks are scarce. When he was ranking risk, he was trying to think about real-world behavior, not necessarily the way to do each activity most safely. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a bar and saying, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll just sit by myself.\u2019\u201d Casanova said.\n\nExperts like Popescu and Casanova have focused on harm reduction \u2014 the same philosophy that leads thousands of American gym teachers to demonstrate putting condoms on bananas. We know, from basic understandings of human behavior, that people are going to do a thing (have sex, that is, not put condoms on a banana). So how can we help them be safer?\n\nBut we\u2019re used to safer sex \u2014 we\u2019re not used to safer daily existence. The muddy middle is frustrating not because we\u2019ve never found ourselves in this type of quagmire before, but because the scale of the swamp is so vast and because, just yesterday, it was a garden.\n\n[Related: Why It Took So Long For Politicians To Treat The Child Care Crisis As A Crisis]\n\nWe are faced with too many choices \u2014 not just what to do, but how to do it and when and where. The stakes are high, 140,000 people are dead in the U.S. and death rates are starting to climb again. And because of those stakes, we\u2019ve assigned a morality to all these choices \u2014 something that psychology researchers have shown leads us to frame things as \u201call good\u201d or \u201call bad\u201d and lose sight of the gray areas all around us. We\u2019re all bogged down and floundering, questioning our own goodness while we arch our eyebrows at our friends and argue over whose patch of muck is really solid ground.\n\nIn some ways, it would be easier to just not care, to be one of those people who see no difference among a park, a swamp and the rim of an active volcano, to be one of those people who is mentally living six months ago. Then I could cheerfully traipse from my backyard to a neighbor\u2019s driveway and then on to a dark corner booth somewhere with no worries. No stress. It would hardly even be a decision. Maybe I could even get angry about stores and cities setting up rules and see something like a mask requirement as a violation of my freedoms. Then I could be oblivious to the far more terrible freedom of the muddy middle \u2014 where everything is a choice, and they\u2019re all mine to make and to live with.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-decision-is-a-risk-every-risk-is-a-decision/", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"title": "How To Make Indoor Air Safer", "text": "If you\u2019re waiting for a break from bad news about COVID, don\u2019t hold your breath \u2014 or, actually, do hold your breath.\n\nExperts have understood for months that the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, can be spread by hitching a ride inside large respiratory droplets that are expelled when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. But there\u2019s growing evidence that smaller airborne particles called aerosols can carry and spread the virus, too.\n\nThe methods for preventing spread from respiratory droplets are familiar: social distancing, frequent hand-washing and wearing a mask. But the methods for stopping aerosols, which are lightweight and may be able to hang in the air for hours, are less obvious and often rely on technology. But can something like an air filter really stop a seemingly unstoppable pandemic?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. The larger respiratory droplets that are known to spread the coronavirus are larger bits of spit and mucus that a person propels outward when they forcefully exhale. If the person is infectious, these droplets can be spiked with virus particles which, if they can find their way to your nose, mouth or eyes, can enter your body and cause infection. The droplets are between 5 and 10 microns across (a human hair is, on average, roughly 70 microns in diameter), and they\u2019re heavy, as far as bodily secretions go, so they quickly fall to the floor \u2014 or nearby surface, or nearby facial orifice. But when we talk or laugh or sing or even just breathe, we also produce smaller, lighter droplets (less than 5 microns) that evaporate before gravity can do its thing, causing the dried remnants to stay aloft like a microscopic feather.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, experts weren\u2019t sure if these aerosols could contain enough virus or hang around long enough to actually infect anybody. A person can\u2019t be infected by inhaling one or two viruses \u2014 they need to be exposed to a certain concentration of the virus before it can gain a foothold, though experts still aren\u2019t sure what this threshold, called the infectious dose, is. But now there\u2019s growing evidence that, yes, the aerosols carry the virus and, in a high enough concentration, can cause infection.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a process of elimination. You get to the point where you say, \u2018It sort of looks like aerosol transmission,\u2019\u201d said Lisa M. Brosseau, a research consultant at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. \u201cIn the midst of a pandemic, that\u2019s what you have. You take what evidence you have, what you can observe, and you draw conclusions from that.\u201d\n\nWhen people are outside, aerosol transmission is less of a concern because in wide-open spaces, these particles are quickly dispersed and diluted, making it difficult for an infectious concentration to accumulate, Brosseau said. It\u2019s like dropping some food coloring into a river. But indoors, especially if the ventilation is poor, it\u2019s much easier for aerosols to accumulate \u2014 more like dropping food coloring into a birdbath.\n\nSometimes, though, you can\u2019t avoid taking a dip in those murky waters. The good news is there are ways to dilute and clear out aerosols from indoor spaces. But it requires more effort.\n\nOpening a window can help because it forces fresh air in, and some of the contaminated air will make its way outside. \u201cThere is no doubt that, over time, on average, the concentration of aerosols is going to go down if you open up the windows,\u201d said Rajat Mittal, a mechanical engineering professor who studies aerodynamics at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBut if you\u2019re, say, sitting in a classroom in Minnesota in January, or Arizona in September, opening up the windows might not be the most practical solution.\n\nInstead, school boards and offices should look to their heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. But you can\u2019t just shuffle air around the building \u2014 that could spread the virus to even more places. Instead, you have to replace the air itself.\n\n\u201cYou can achieve an air change by one of two ways,\u201d said David Krause, a certified industrial hygienist and the owner of HealthCare Consulting and Contracting. The first is \u201cthrough the gross changeout of air, bringing in outside air and exhausting air from the room. Or you can achieve it by using high-efficiency filters that effectively remove virus-containing particles from the air.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nFilters can capture virus-laden particles through a number of methods, including physically trapping them with a fine enough filter and using electrostatic attraction to charge particles and force them to settle out of the air.\n\nTo catch the tiny aerosols that might be carrying the coronavirus, filters need a high enough MERV \u2014 yes, MERV. Surely you\u2019ve heard of the minimum efficiency reporting value before, no? A filter with a MERV rating of 1, for example, will capture less than 20 percent of particles that are 3 to 10 microns across. As the MERV rating increases, so does the number of particles it captures, along with the amount of force an HVAC system needs to push the air through the fine filter.\n\nTo effectively neutralize indoor transmission of the novel coronavirus, you\u2019d need a MERV of at least 13, according to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not recommending major modifications to most air conditioning systems. Many of them can simply change out one efficiency of filter for another,\u201d said William Bahnfleth, a professor of architectural engineering at Pennsylvania State University and the chair of ASHRAE\u2019s epidemic task force. \u201cI have MERV-13 filters in my home air conditioner.\u201d\n\nBut changing out the filter alone might not be enough. Krause pointed to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which were published before the COVID-19 pandemic, that outline exactly what standards buildings need to have to achieve \u201cairborne infection isolation,\u201d which means stopping the spread of aerosols smaller than 5 microns. At a minimum, buildings need to be reaching six air changes per hour, according to these CDC guidelines. Krause said the average commercial building now only performs one or two air changes per hour, and could squeeze in another with an air filtration system.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\n\u201cThe other four and a half or five air changes per hour, you\u2019re really going to have to rely on in-room, standalone, HEPA filter air cleaners,\u201d Krause said, referring to high efficiency particulate air filters. \u201cWe should be looking at these if we have any illusions of sending kids back to school.\u201d\n\nAll that filtration can be expensive, though. A commercial-sized MERV-13 filter can cost three to four times more than a lower-standard filter, and portable air cleaners can be up to $1,000 each, according to Krause, so the cost for offices and schools is not small. And using a filtration system creates a new risk for whoever has to change out the virus-soaked filters.\n\nStill, HVAC systems can\u2019t guarantee 100 percent safety. The idea behind all these air changes and filters is to dilute and clean the air so that aerosols can\u2019t build up into high concentrations. But it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that an aerosol will get sucked up by a filter or a ventilation system before it gets sucked up by a person, especially if a lot of people are close together for long periods of time.\n\nUltraviolet light filters could also help: UV light can kill microorganisms, including viruses, but the experts I spoke to raised concerns about this method. For one, killing the virus this way requires continually exposing it to UV light for several minutes \u2014 if it simply floats by a light, such as one in a vent, that might not be enough. For another, UV has other potential risks, including skin and eye damage.\n\nRegardless of what building managers choose to do, their efforts will be moot if people aren\u2019t also taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets by wearing masks, washing their hands frequently and practicing social distancing. All the open windows in the world can\u2019t help if you\u2019re swallowing globs of virus-laden spit.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci | FiveThirtyEight", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-make-indoor-air-safer/", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers"]}, {"title": "Canceled Races Aren\u2019t Stopping Endurance Athletes From Setting Wild New Records", "text": "Just before 6:30 a.m. on June 15, sleep-deprived and feet afire with blisters, Joe \u201cStringbean\u201d McConaughy crossed over Vermont\u2019s border with Massachusetts. After subsisting mostly on watery mashed Oreos and Fritos for the final miles, McConaughy finished a grueling trek along Vermont\u2019s Long Trail in 4 days, 23 hours and 54 minutes \u2014 the fastest an athlete has been known to traverse the entire trail without a prearranged support crew. The 273-mile trail through the Green Mountains takes an average hiker between 20 and 30 days to complete and is known for relentless black flies, knee-deep muddy stretches and varying terrain from thick forest to alpine tundra. It is the oldest long-distance trail in the United States and one of the classics for attempting a fastest known time.\n\nFastest known times, or FKTs, are set by endurance athletes running or hiking a route, either alone or in teams. The goal is to set an unofficial record for finishing a course in the shortest possible time. In an FKT attempt, there are no bibs, no crowds and no medals. Whether deep in Appalachia or on the lip of the Grand Canyon, athletes are able to compete while maintaining physical distance from others. It just might be the perfect coronavirus pursuit. And as it turns out, the FKT scene has exploded this year.\n\nAs COVID-19 shut down state after state, many organized endurance races were canceled or rescheduled. The New York City Marathon \u2014 which would have celebrated its golden anniversary this year \u2014 and the never-before-canceled Boston Marathon are among the most well-known and highly anticipated races that have been nixed. In the ultra-trail-running world, cornerstone races Ultra Trail du Mont-Blanc in Europe and Barkley Marathon in Tennessee have also been scrapped this year.\n\nFor athletes who ramped themselves into peak form for spring and summer marathons, there are a few options other than scaling back their training plans. They could do what one guy did and run a marathon on his terrace during lockdown. They could join a number of virtual races. Or, they could lace up and run through the night from the Canadian border to Massachusetts, like McConaughy did.\n\nSo how many athletes are following suit? We took a look at the data from FastestKnownTime.com, the central website for submitting FKTs, to see just how many records have fallen so far this year.\n\nRunners submitted 3.8 times as many FKTs through June of this year as in the same period a year ago. \u201cNot only in the numbers, but there\u2019s been a huge uptick in the amount of work for us,\u201d said Peter Bakwin, one of the creators of FastestKnownTime.com. There is no official governing organization for FKT routes and records, but Bakwin and his co-founders, Buzz Burrell and Jeff Schuler, act as the volunteer commissioners for approving routes and verifying times. FKT attempts had been gaining in popularity even before this year, but submissions in the past few months reflect the type of growth Bakwin and Burrell expected to see five years from now. Many of the submissions cited canceled races as the reason for the FKT attempt, they said.\n\nSome associations that care for long-distance trails like the Appalachian Trail and Pacific Crest Trail are recommending that through-hikers postpone or cancel their hikes this year to avoid spreading the virus on trails and into nearby towns. Those who hit the trails anyway are advised to stay local and be self-supported (so, carry what you need on and off the trail and avoid going into local towns or using trail amenities like outhouses). Because rules and recommendations have changed often in the past few months, Bakwin and Burrell are reluctant to play police. \u201cEarly on we did have to confront that question and basically we don\u2019t want to have to verify what\u2019s legal with changing laws \u2014 we just don\u2019t have the capacity to do that,\u201d Bakwin said.\n\nBut the site is also getting submissions from people who are creating their own local adventures, which means many new, interesting routes. A loop through Central Park might not seem creative on its face, but Aaron Zellheofer added an interesting new mechanic: Rather than running a single loop as fast as he could, he aimed to run as many laps of the main road as he could during the hours the park was open (6 a.m. to 1 a.m.). He ran 11 6.1-mile laps.\n\n\u201cWe were OK with it because Central Park truly is classic, the route around the park is defined, and his timing was also very defined,\u201d Burrell said. \u201cAnd there are millions of people who live right there, so that\u2019s one that a lot of people could contest,\u201d Bakwin added.\n\nLockdowns have left many with time to plan routes and strategies for an FKT. The sport is inherently creative in that runners only have to adhere to a fairly vague seven-point list when crafting a route. That flexibility also allows nonelite runners to submit a route\u2019s first FKT, earning them a spot on the website. \u201cOften they\u2019ll [submit a route and] say, \u2018My time can easily be beat,\u2019\u201d Bakwin said. \u201cBut, you know \u2014 if you can\u2019t be fast, be first.\u201d\n\nThough the majority of the site\u2019s FKTs are for routes in the United States, times can be submitted for courses in any country. And this year, Bakwin said he has seen a surge of routes in Europe, particularly from Germany, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and the U.K. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but some countries are totally into it,\u201d Bakwin said. \u201cI think they must have just got wind of it, and when one or two guys start talking about it over it there, I\u2019m guessing the community is not that big.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for 2020, Bakwin and Burrell put together a list of 10 \u201cpremier routes\u201d (all in the United States) to encourage FKT attempts this year. The goal is to attract more elite athletes who are more likely to have a corporate sponsor who will help track and document the attempt, which the site\u2019s organizers hoped will quell some verification controversies in previous FKTs.\n\nFastestKnownTimes.com breaks record attempts down into three categories: supported (getting help or supplies from people you\u2019ve arranged to meet up with along the way), self-supported (no prearranged help, but cadging food or water from people you happen across is allowed) and unsupported (you carry everything you need from start to finish. ) McConaughy had set out to attempt an unsupported FKT on the Long Trail, but he ended up accepting water along the route, turning his trek \u2014 in which he cruised at around 54 miles a day \u2014 into a self-supported FKT. Less than a month later, Brett Mastrangelo attempted to usurp McConaughy\u2019s record but had to call it quits two days in because of a leg injury. And plenty of other athletes are making their FKT attempts on premier routes this year: Sarah Hansel just completed the first unsupported women\u2019s attempt at Nolan\u2019s 14 (a route covering 14 mountains in Colorado) on July 8, while Avery Collins started the trail but did not finish. Liz Anjos is in the second week of her attempt on the Appalachian Trail. Two others are publicly posting the tracker data during their FKT attempts as they challenge the current supported and self-supported records on the Colorado Trail.\n\nWill the popularity of the FKT continue? Before the pandemic, Bakwin and Burrell couldn\u2019t have predicted that the sport would catch fire this year, and they\u2019re not sure what to expect after races can safely start again. \u201cThe unforeseen consequences of a global pandemic are many and surprising,\u201d Bakwin said. \u201cI would guess that once races start happening again, some of the traffic will taper off, but some people will have found a new thing that they will make part of their training and racing season rather than races.\u201d", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/canceled-races-arent-stopping-endurance-athletes-from-setting-wild-new-records/", "author": ["Anna Wiederkehr"]}, {"title": "Politics Podcast: There Aren\u2019t Secret Trump Voters", "text": "A recent Monmouth poll showed that a majority of Pennsylvanians \u2014 57 percent \u2014 believe there are \u201csecret\u201d voters in their communities who support Trump but won\u2019t tell anyone about it.

The WNBA is set to begin its season on July 25, while the NBA \u2014 the league whose abrupt shutdown set off a cascade of matching shutdowns in other sports \u2014 will restart its own season on July 30 at Walt Disney World.\n\nAs of today, it has been 131 days since the NBA last conducted a regular-season game, so you\u2019d be forgiven for not necessarily recalling the particulars of where things left off. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. Ahead of the resumption of the NBA season, we want to give you a brief refresher on the 22 teams that were invited to Orlando: who they are, where they were when we last saw them, whether they have sustained any confirmed or reported coronavirus cases, what else has changed for them during the four-plus-month hiatus, and what we can expect from them during both the seeding games and \u2014 if they\u2019re lucky enough to make it there \u2014 the playoffs.\n\n[Related: Our NBA Predictions]\n\nWe\u2019re breaking these 22 teams down into three tiers: the inner-circle contenders, the potential party-crashers and those that are seemingly along for the ride for no particular reason beyond the league wanting to maximize the number of games played (and, thus, revenue earned). We\u2019ll begin below with that final group, which consists of the nine teams invited to the restart that have yet to secure postseason positioning.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\n26-39, 13th in West, 6 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: <1% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 3-5; 29-44\n\nCOVID-19: Two unnamed players (reported)\n\nThe Suns face the toughest climb of any remaining team to actually make it to the playoffs. They are six games and five spots back of the eighth-seeded Grizzlies, which means they need to pick up at least two games on Memphis and pass four other teams in the standings just to make it to a potential play-in round, where they\u2019d need to win back-to-back games to claim a postseason berth. They\u2019ll have to make that run without the services of forward Kelly Oubre, who is in Orlando with the team but will not participate in the restart as he focuses on rehabbing from the torn meniscus he suffered in late February. FiveThirtyEight projects the Suns will go 3-5 against the seventh-toughest seeding-game schedule among teams invited to the restart, leaving them far short of securing a playoff berth.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\n27-36, 12th in West, 4 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: <1% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 2-6; 29-42\n\nCOVID-19: No public reports or announcements\n\nSan Antonio comes into the restart without either of its two starting big men. LaMarcus Aldridge was shut down after having surgery on his right shoulder, while Trey Lyles underwent an appendectomy and was also declared out for the remainder of the season. The Spurs were already facing long odds to make the playoffs, but they got even longer when Aldridge went down. Their defense has not been up to snuff all year, which means they were going to have to depend on outscoring teams. This will be much more difficult to do without Aldridge, who propped up a unit that checked in only slightly above-average anyway. In the absence of him and Lyles, San Antonio will likely have to play much smaller than it usually has this season, and veteran forward Rudy Gay recently indicated the team\u2019s young players might see more a extended run during the seeding games.\n\nWashington Wizards\n\n24-40, 9th in East, 5.5 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 5% playoffs, <1% East, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 2-6; 26-46\n\nCOVID-19: Gary Payton Jr. (reported), Thomas Bryant (reported)\n\nThe lone out-of-playoff-position team from the East invited to make the trip to Disney, the Wizards will be incredibly shorthanded in Orlando. Pending free-agent sniper D\u0101vis Bert\u0101ns opted out of the restart, while All-Star guard Bradley Beal will sit out with a shoulder injury. John Wall also remains sidelined, as he has been for the entire season. The Wizards have to pick up 1.5 games on the Magic or two games on the Nets to qualify for a potential play-in round, but they face a tougher schedule than either of those two teams and will also be without their three best players. Accordingly, we predict the Wiz to fall even further back from the pack than they are right now.\n\nSacramento Kings\n\n28-36, 11th in West, 3.5 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 7% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 3-5; 31-41\n\nCOVID-19: Harrison Barnes (announced), Alex Len (reported), Buddy Hield (returned to practice), Jabari Parker (returned to practice)\n\nOne of several teams that shut down their practice facility ahead of traveling to Orlando in the wake of a positive test for a member of their traveling party, the Kings have had more publicly confirmed COVID cases than any other team in the restart since leaguewide testing began in early July. A few of those players have returned to practice, but star guard De\u2019Aaron Fox sprained his ankle during one of those sessions, and the Kings announced Wednesday evening that he would be reevaluated in seven to 10 days. Their outlook appears bleak if Fox is not 100 percent, despite facing one of the league\u2019s easiest remaining schedules.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\n29-37, 9th in West, 3.5 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 12% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 3-5; 32-42\n\nCOVID-19: No public reports or announcements\n\nPortland, more than any other team in the league, benefited from the season\u2019s interruption. When they return to the floor, the Blazers may be without Trevor Ariza, but they\u2019ll get both Jusuf Nurki\u0107 and Zach Collins back. The Blazers\u2019 preferred starters in the front court are each set to return from the long-term injuries that had limited Collins to just three games and kept Nurkic out all year. The boost to their roster and the question marks surrounding other No. 8-seed contenders would seemingly have the Blazers poised to make a run at the play-in round, but they have the misfortune of facing the fifth-toughest remaining schedule, with games against the Celtics, Rockets, Nuggets, Clippers and 76ers. They do open against the Grizzlies and close against the severely shorthanded Nets, though, so perhaps their chances of making it beyond the seeding games are being slightly underrated at just 12 percent.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\n32-33, 8th in West\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 36% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 3-5; 35-38 (play-in participant vs. NOP)\n\nCOVID-19: No public reports or announcements\n\nBefore the season came to a screeching halt, the Grizzlies were this season\u2019s most pleasant surprise. Led by star rookie Ja Morant, the youngest team in the NBA managed to bounce back from a 6-16 start by amassing the league\u2019s ninth-best record from Dec. 8 on, and it enters the restart with a sizable lead in the race for the No. 8 seed in the West. However, despite the fact the Grizzlies will likely get Justise Winslow back on the floor now that his back injury has had time to heal, FiveThirtyEight is pessimistic about their chances of holding onto their spot. While the Elo-specific forecast (which is based mostly on this season\u2019s performance, as well as some of last season\u2019s) gives the Grizzlies a 69 percent chance of advancing to the postseason, the version of the forecast powered by RAPTOR player ratings pegs that chance at only 38 percent, instead favoring the next team on our list despite the fact that it needs to make up some ground or else win a play-in series.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\n28-36, 10th in West, 3.5 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 45% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 5-3; 33-39 (play-in participant vs. POR)\n\nCOVID-19: Three unnamed players (announced)\n\nSuperstar rookie Zion Williamson left the bubble last week to deal with what the Pelicans described as an \u201curgent family medical matter.\u201d He\u2019s expected to rejoin the team at some point, and our projections have not yet been tweaked to account for his potential absence \u2014 largely because we do not yet know how long said absence might be, or if he\u2019ll return in time to take part in all eight seeding games. Zion or no Zion, the Pelicans need to remain within four games of the Grizzlies (while also holding off the Blazers, Spurs, Kings and Suns) to force a play-in series. The system currently favors the Pellies to grab the No. 8 seed from the Grizz\u2019s clutches, the result of both New Orleans\u2019 strong roster ratings (in which Williamson\u2019s presence factors heavily) and a cupcake schedule that is the easiest of any team invited to Disney.\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\n30-34, 7th in East\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 95% playoffs, <1% East, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 2-6; 32-40 (8th in East)\n\nCOVID-19: Kevin Durant and three unnamed teammates (announced), DeAndre Jordan (out), Spencer Dinwiddie (out), Taurean Prince (out), Michael Beasley (out)\n\nThe Nets will be practically unrecognizable in Orlando. As you may have already forgotten, Kenny Atkinson and the team \u201cmutually agreed to part ways\u201d this year, with Atkinson being replaced by interim coach Jacque Vaughn. Vaughn immediately inserted Jordan into the starting lineup ahead of Jarrett Allen, but Jordan tested positive for COVID-19 and so, along with his buddies Durant and Kyrie Irving, he will not be participating in the restart. He\u2019s not the only one. Dinwiddie and Prince are also out of the lineup with positive coronavirus tests, while Wilson Chandler opted out of the restart because of concerns for his family\u2019s health. The Nets signed several substitute players to account for their various absences, but one of those players was Beasley, who later tested positive for COVID-19 and left the bubble. Still, we expect Brooklyn will hang onto its playoff spot and narrowly avoid a play-in series against the Wizards.\n\nOrlando Magic\n\n30-35, 8th in East\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: >99% playoffs, <1% East, <1% Finals\n\nProjected Seeding W-L: 4-4; 34-39 (7th in East)\n\nCOVID-19: James Ennis (recovered)\n\nThe Magic have the benefit of participating in a restart held essentially in their own backyard. They, like other banged-up teams, also had the time they needed for injuries to heal. Specifically, Evan Fournier is expected to return from the elbow injury that sidelined him prior to the hiatus, giving the Magic back one of their top scorers. Orlando\u2019s restart schedule is significantly tougher than the one it would have faced down the stretch of the actual regular season, but it still ranks in the bottom third of remaining teams. That, plus Brooklyn\u2019s spate of absences, leads our predictions to believe the Magic will leapfrog the Nets for the No. 7 seed in the East, thus avoiding having to face the Bucks in the first round.\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whos-who-in-the-nba-bubble-the-teams-just-along-for-the-ride/", "author": ["Jared Dubin"]}, {"title": "Do You Buy That \u2026 Mail-In Voting Will Hurt Republicans?", "text": "Send to Email Address\n\nYour Name\n\nYour Email Address\n\nPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\n\nEmail check failed, please try again\n\nSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/do-you-buy-that-mail-in-voting-will-hurt-republicans/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "Secret Trump Voters Didn\u2019t Decide 2016 And Probably Won\u2019t Swing 2020", "text": "A recent poll showed that the majority of Pennsylvanians think people in their community secretly support President Trump.

For months the country was focused on reopening the economy, which had its own complicated set of problems. But only recently has a broader swath of America tuned into the mess nestled inside it, one that parents have been sitting with for months: what to do with the kids.\n\nThere has been no federal plan to help American parents with child care, and they continue to wonder whether schools will really open their doors come the new school year. That lack of action is in direct contrast to other crises that have struck America recently. After the financial crash of 2008, there was a bailout and a stimulus plan. After the protests against police over the last few months, officials in cities and states responded with promises of better actions in the future but also, immediate policy implementation: New York state repealed a law that had shielded police personnel files, while the Minneapolis City Council voted to begin a process that could eventually lead to the dissolution of the city police as it\u2019s now known.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nBut on child care and school, a specific, urgent response has been missing, or at least one that acknowledges our new reality. President Trump threatened to withhold federal funding for education if schools didn\u2019t open back up, counter to schools\u2019 insistence they need more money to provide a safe education amid the pandemic. While the CARES Act, an omnibus COVID-19 relief bill signed into law in late March, gave extra stimulus funding to families with children, schools and child care businesses so they could remain afloat, a Democratic-backed bill to give a $50 billion bailout of the child care industry has gotten little attention. Teachers around the country have voiced doubt that necessary safety measures for in-school teaching will be sufficient, and Los Angeles Unified School District, one of the country\u2019s largest school systems, has decided not to reopen classrooms when schools go back in session in August. Some worry that while distance learning is safer, socially different children and those without stable internet connections or computers \u2014 who are already at the margins in normal times \u2014 will fall irrevocably behind.\n\nThere is no cohesive solution to America\u2019s child care problem. But the relative inattention to this crisis, one that\u2019s so foundational to a functioning society, the economy and family units across the country, is revealing. It shows that for all the changes that have happened in American life \u2014 more female elected officials, a MeToo movement and a workforce that is around 47 percent female \u2014 our power dynamics remain fundamentally skewed. We are failing to collectively understand what our most critical and pressing problems actually are.\n\n\u201cCare in general has always been seen as a sideline issue,\u201d Vicki Shabo of the left-leaning think tank New America said. \u201cA nice-to-have and not something that\u2019s necessary, and not something that\u2019s central for adults to be productive in the economy.\u201d Of course, now we\u2019re seeing how much of a misunderstanding that is. In a country where most men and women work even when they have children, having child care is inextricably linked to economic productivity \u2014 and not having it often hurts women most. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2015 found that in households with children under 6, women spent an hour a day doing child care, compared to the 25 minutes of care provided by men. It\u2019s easy to extrapolate this trend for pandemic times: American women will bear the brunt of the school and child care crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: COVID-19 deaths are rising. What will the U.S. do?\n\nYet, child care in particular hasn\u2019t often found itself at the forefront of political debate. Experts and activists I talked to for this story all used the same framing to talk about why: an American narrative that child care problems are individuals\u2019 problems, not society\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIf you think about child care traditionally before the pandemic, you probably didn\u2019t think about it too much before you had kids,\u201d Melissa Boteach, vice president of income security and child care at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said. \u201cThen you have kids, you\u2019re in the most stressful and resource-strapped part of your life: You\u2019re operating on three hours of sleep a night, you\u2019re financially squeezed, because at the very time you\u2019re taking off of work, you have diapers and wipes and formula and whatever else. You\u2019re in this total daze of early motherhood. That\u2019s probably not the time when you say, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to call my member of Congress.\u2019 You\u2019re feeling it like a personal issue.\u201d\n\nChild care isn\u2019t necessarily seen as a macroeconomic issue or a driver of labor force participation or GDP, Shabo said. And because of that, she said, it often takes a backseat to economic issues like wages when lobbying efforts happen. This is not to say that child care issues don\u2019t get attention \u2014 in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, which featured several female candidates, child care plans took a more front and center role in the campaign than they had in the past. One leading candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, co-authored a 2004 book, \u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d which was about the ways the rising incomes of households with two full-time employed adults belied the heavy costs of essentials like child care. Warren thought child care costs were among the reasons the American middle class was in an economic crisis.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\n\u201cOur workplaces were built for white men,\u201d said Danielle Atkinson, the founder and director of Mothering Justice, a Detroit-area advocacy group for working families. The fact that parents are left to fend for themselves from birth to kindergarten and then during the after-school, pre-dinner hours, is an American tradition that seems to assume a readily available, at-home caregiver. (Atkinson pointed out the inextricable role black women have played in American child care; enslaved women often took care of white children.) The nuclear family with a stay-at-home parent (usually a mother) is an ideal that persists, or at the very least lingers in American life: only 18 percent of Americans in a 2018 Pew Research Survey thought it was ideal for both parents to work full time.\n\n\u201cThis conversation about school is really a conversation about work,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cThe conversation about returning to school is not based on health. It\u2019s about returning those workers to working and not looking after their children, so those children have to be somewhere.\u201d Essential workers in particular are being forced to make difficult choices about their children\u2019s care \u2014 many essential-worker jobs are lower wage \u2014 and many child care providers are in strapped situations. The work of child care providers, Atkinson said, is often undervalued \u2014 their median annual wage in 2017 was a little more than $22,000 annually, which is just above the federal government\u2019s poverty line for a family of three \u2014 and as Boteach pointed out, those workers could continue to risk greater infection rates as schools and work open back up. She highlighted the plan put forth by Senate Democrats, the Child Care Is Essential Act \u2014 which would provide a bailout to the suffering industry and additional money for those providers to buy personal protective equipment \u2014 and cited an estimate that the U.S. child care industry would need a $9.6 billion injection monthly to survive the pandemic.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nIt\u2019s more likely the next governmental nod to parents and their school-age children will come in the next iteration of the omnibus coronavirus relief package. Congressional Democrats have proposed $350 billion in funds for schools and universities to purchase PPE and clean their facilities. Republicans agree about more funds, though it\u2019s not clear what their proposed number is \u2014 some have argued that since many schools will be operating on a partly virtual basis, less federal funding is needed.\n\nThe moral tussling that many parents have been doing \u2014 go back to work and risk potential COVID-19 infection at day care or school \u2014 will likely continue to be subjected to partisan politics. Trump and his Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have been the loudest voices in recent days about sending children back to school at all costs, much to the chagrin of teachers, many of whom feel ill-prepared for the safety precautions necessary for in-person pandemic teaching. Ultimately, though, it is parents who are forced to make a choice. Atkinson, a mother of six, told me she would be keeping her children home in the fall.\n\n[Related: The Latest Political Polls Collected By FiveThirtyEight]\n\nFor those who focus on child care, the pandemic has perversely presented an opportunity to advance the cause of greater access to guaranteed services. \u201cThis pandemic has created greater alignment of experience, potentially, between white middle class folks who saw this as an individual issue that they were struggling with and outraged by but hadn\u2019t really taken action on and the longtime, long-standing lived experience of lower wage folks and people of color who have struggled for decades with the unaffordability of child care and the lack of care options to meet their work schedules,\u201d Shabo said.\n\nAtkinson said she also hoped the individualism narrative would be shattered by the current crisis. \u201cWe want to lift the veil away and help women, especially white women, know that you\u2019ve been lied to. You were sold a bunch of lies: \u2018if you just work harder, if you just slay sexism, you\u2019ll be OK.\u2019 But really, it\u2019s a tool to divide,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pandemic has shattered norms and paradigms ever since it arrived in the U.S. \u2014 our expectations of child care is no exception.

It is both. I mean, it\u2019s not a unidimensional thing. It\u2019s complicated. There are some governors and mayors that did it perfectly correctly. They stayed exactly. They wanted to open up, so they went through the guidelines of opening up their state. But what happened is that many of the citizenry, said, \u201cYou know, well, I\u2019m either going to be locked down or I\u2019m going to let it all rip.\u201d And you could see from just looking, documented on TV and in the papers of still photos of people at bars and congregations, which are a perfect setup, particularly if you don\u2019t have a mask. Yeah, then there are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly.\n\nAR: Do you think that Florida and Arizona opened up too quickly?\n\nAF: You know, I think in some respects, in some cases, they did not always. But I think that that certainly is contributing to that. Certainly Florida I know, you know, I think jumped over a couple of checkpoints.\n\n\n\n\n\nFauci on why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a surge in cases l FiveThirtyEight\n\nOn whether partisanship makes fighting COVID-19 more difficult:\n\nAR You know, for a few months, masks were quite a partisan issue, though in the past few weeks politicians on both sides have advocated for their use. Do you think America\u2019s hyperpartisan environment has made it more difficult to suppress the virus?\n\nAF: You know, I think you\u2019d have to admit that that\u2019s the case. We live, I mean, you have to be having blindfolders on and covering your ears to think that we don\u2019t live in a very divisive society now, from a political standpoint. I mean, it\u2019s just unfortunate, but it is what it is. And you know, from experience historically, that when you don\u2019t have unanimity in an approach to something, you\u2019re not as effective in how you handle it. So I think you\u2019d have to make the assumption that if there wasn\u2019t such divisiveness, that we would have a more coordinated approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nFauci on whether partisanship makes fighting COVID-19 more difficult\n\nOn how the U.S. is doing:\n\nAR: How do you think the U.S. is doing right now? If you\u2019re looking across the world, what are your feelings about how we\u2019re doing right now?\n\nAF: Well, let me say there are parts of the United States, like where you live right now [in New York], that are doing really well, that you\u2019ve been through something really bad and you have things under control. And you have a governor and mayor in the city who understand what it means to go by the guidelines for the gateway, phase one, phase two, phase three. So you\u2019re doing well. Other cities are doing well. But as a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don\u2019t think you can say we\u2019re doing great. I mean, we\u2019re just not.\n\nOn travel restrictions:\n\nAR: We\u2019re at this weird place now where the EU and some other European countries are opening their borders, but they\u2019re still banning travel from the United States. Do you think that\u2019s a justified decision on their part?\n\nAF: You know, I wouldn\u2019t use the word justified. I would say it\u2019s understandable. Because, you know, when we saw that there were many cases in Europe and in China, we banned travel from the European Union, from the U.K., to us. So right now, they have their infection rate very low, much lower than we do. So they\u2019re looking at us and they\u2019re saying the same thing that we said to them. I wish that that were not the case. I wouldn\u2019t be recommending that. I think we need to get back to some sort of normality. Just the same as they\u2019re saying to us, \u201cWhy are you still banning travel from Europe?\u201d Which we are. I mean, so I\u2019m all for America and I back what we do. But if I were a European, then I\u2019d be looking at us. I\u2019d say, \u201cWhy are you still banning Europeans from coming to the United States?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFauci on travel restrictions during the pandemic and the EU ban l FiveThirtyEight\n\nOn whether we can get control of the virus without a vaccine:\n\nAR: Without a vaccine, how hopeful are you that we\u2019ll get this pandemic under control in the U.S.?\n\nAF: I think we can get it under control. But keeping it under control is going to be the real problem. Because this virus is not like other viruses that we\u2019ve experienced, like the original SARS from 2002. That was a coronavirus. It caused an outbreak, a pandemic \u2014 there were 8,000 cases and 800 deaths. So in magnitude alone, you see how different it is from what we\u2019re doing now. But it was not really very well and efficiently transmissible, whereas this virus, to our dismay, is spectacularly efficient in transmitting from person to person. So that makes me skeptical whether we would get permanent, sustained control of this without having a vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nFauci on whether we can get control of the virus without a vaccine | FiveThirtyEight\n\nOn how anti-vaxxers affect what will happen once a vaccine is discovered:\n\nAR: One thing I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about is that, you know, with any vaccine, even after it goes through extensive clinical trials, there is always some risk of adverse effects. And even if the side effects with the COVID vaccine, whatever it may be, are extremely small, it\u2019s going to get more media attention than probably any other vaccine in history. At the same time, we also have a growing anti-vaccine movement in this country and around the world. So I\u2019m wondering whether you and other other public health officials are concerned about kind of the long term impact of this moment on vaccine acceptance?\n\nAF: That\u2019s a great question, Anna. Because what it really tells us is that we got to get it right. We really do. Because if we don\u2019t, it might have a real negative impact in the long range, in the long term, on how people approach and respond to the need for vaccination, which is the reason why we\u2019re taking so seriously that even though we\u2019re doing this quickly, we\u2019re not compromising the safety and nor are we compromising the scientific integrity. So as we go into the phase three trials, not only are we going to be looking at efficacy, but we\u2019re going to be really paying attention: Is there anything there that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s even suggestive of a negative impact? That\u2019s going to be really very important. So that\u2019s a really important question you asked.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dr-fauci-partisanship-has-made-it-more-difficult-to-suppress-covid-19/", "author": ["Anna Rothschild", "Jake Arlow"]}, {"title": "America Is Testing For COVID-19 More Than Ever \u2014 And It Still Isn\u2019t Enough", "text": "America Is Testing For COVID-19 More Than Ever \u2014 And It Still Isn\u2019t Enough\n\nExpert consensus was clear early in the pandemic: To control the spread of COVID-19, the U.S. needed to increase testing. Four months on, we are testing more \u2014 a lot more. The number of Americans getting tested daily is higher than at any point in this pandemic, and we\u2019re testing more people per capita than almost any other country on the planet.\n\nYet many experts say we still need more tests.\n\nDespite a steady increase in testing infrastructure, the U.S. is caught in a vicious cycle with no end in sight. A lag in testing leads to more cases, which leads to the need for even more tests to finally get a handle on the pandemic. We\u2019ve been playing catch up from the beginning, and, experts say, we\u2019re still not close to closing the gap in most states.\n\nIn early May, for example, a group of researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute calculated the average daily number of tests each state and Washington, D.C., would need to conduct in order to begin reopening later that month. At the end of June, the researchers adjusted those numbers. In 18 states and D.C., the June testing goals for mitigating the pandemic were lower than the goals first proposed in May since the pandemic had waned there. But in the rest of the country, the testing goals were higher. Of these 32 states with higher testing goals in June, just six had an average daily testing rate last month that met the goal, and 13 still didn\u2019t have an average daily testing rate that met the May benchmarks.\n\nThe majority of states and U.S. are lagging behind in testing The difference in the average number of tests and the Harvard Global Health Institute\u2019s mitigation testing goal for each state, D.C. and the country JUNE testing AVERAGE HARVARD JUNE GOAL Difference Hawaii 771 192 +301% Vermont 1,060 265 +300% Alaska 2,016 520 +288% Montana 1,702 553 +208% New Jersey 22,541 7,346 +207% West Virginia 2,471 923 +168% Connecticut 7,212 2,769 +160% New York 61,704 29,591 +109% D.C. 1,694 1,002 +69% Maine 1,511 952 +59% Delaware 1,674 1,268 +32% Illinois 23,525 19,116 +23% Massachusetts 8,510 7,333 +16% South Dakota 1,199 1,041 +15% Idaho 1,420 1,363 +4% Rhode Island 2,926 2,893 +1% North Dakota 1,136 1,129 +1% New Hampshire 1,601 1,622 -1% Maryland 7,799 8,292 -6% Indiana 7,422 8,051 -8% Michigan 13,810 15,646 -12% Oklahoma 4,946 5,816 -15% Nebraska 2,567 3,133 -18% Wyoming 309 394 -21% Pennsylvania 10,284 13,326 -23% Kansas 2,726 3,574 -24% New Mexico 4,776 7,044 -32% Louisiana 11,780 17,896 -34% Minnesota 10,729 17,361 -38% Oregon 3,614 6,152 -41% Kentucky 5,239 9,523 -45% Wisconsin 10,018 19,196 -48% Iowa 4,930 9,497 -48% Virginia 10,988 22,422 -51% Nevada 4,500 9,518 -53% Missouri 5,982 13,007 -54% United States 509,782 1,165,199 -56% Washington 7,003 16,062 -56% Tennessee 11,905 27,894 -57% Ohio 13,234 35,148 -62% Colorado 4,774 12,979 -63% Arkansas 6,056 16,668 -64% Utah 4,228 11,710 -64% California 74,076 222,862 -67% North Carolina 16,458 51,305 -68% Texas 30,581 117,119 -74% Florida 30,788 142,300 -78% Georgia 12,278 64,048 -81% South Carolina 6,012 32,831 -82% Alabama 6,303 41,577 -85% Arizona 10,238 74,135 -86% Mississippi 3,857 28,835 -87% * These 16 states report the number of specimens tested, not people, in their testing reports. Because some people may be tested more than once, these numbers are probably higher than the number of people tested. Texas reports a mix of specimens and people tested. Wyoming switched from reporting data on specimens tested to people on June 19. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare includes a small number of out-of-state residents among its counts. Source: the covid tracking project, Harvard global health institute\n\n\u201cWe are finally hitting the numbers that we needed to hit in March, but it\u2019s July,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and researcher at Harvard who co-authored the testing analysis. \u201cAnd in that interim, hundreds of thousands of new cases have erupted.\u201d\n\nThere are lots of factors that have likely contributed to the fact that the U.S.\u2019s COVID-19 case numbers haven\u2019t dropped the way other countries\u2019 have. But a lack of sufficient testing has made it that much harder to implement any strategy that might help the country overcome those factors. Take contact tracing, for example, a strategy deployed in South Korea early in the pandemic with great success. Ideally, whenever someone tests positive for COVID-19, they\u2019d isolate themselves, and public health workers would contact everyone that person had contact with recently and test them for COVID-19 too. If any of those people test positive, they isolate themselves, and then their recent contacts are tested. None of this is possible without testing.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nThe Harvard testing goals aren\u2019t meant to encourage us to just randomly test 1.2 million Americans every day and hope the virus disappears. The idea is that if we were sufficiently testing to track, trace and isolate positive cases, we\u2019d be seeing daily testing numbers closer to 1.2 million, instead of 600,000.\n\n\u201cI do not want to overstate the kind of magical nature of testing,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, during an online press conference. \u201cThe lack of testing makes it difficult to control the virus, but even if you have adequate capacity, even if you have deployed it effectively, you\u2019ve got to do something with that.\u201d\n\nThe shortfall in testing numbers is due to two pervasive but opposite problems. First, some labs and clinics have a shortage of supplies and a backlog of tests, sometimes running out of tests five minutes after opening, according to a report in The New York Times, other times causing a wait of seven days or more to get test results. That\u2019s partly the result of the country\u2019s original missteps when it comes to testing, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention originally manufacturing faulty tests, and a general lack of preparedness for an epidemic, from which we never fully recovered.\n\nThe second problem speaks to a deeper, more psychological issue. Many states have the capacity for more testing, but people just aren\u2019t lining up to get tested, and contact tracers have reported difficulty getting in touch with individuals who have crossed paths with someone who later tested positive for COVID-19. Dr. Michael Hochman, a professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California, said this might be due to a sense of fatigue about the pandemic. \u201cAt a certain point, you get tested once or twice \u2014 I see this with my patients, they\u2019re like \u2018oh, this was a waste of time,\u2019\u201d Hochman said. \u201cIn the beginning, my patients were calling me asking to get tested. Those calls aren\u2019t coming in anymore.\u201d\n\n[Related: The Science of Mask-Wearing Hasn\u2019t Changed. So Why Have Our Expectations?]\n\nThere are also other factors that discourage people from getting tested, including costs (while tests are free, the appointment needed to get a test often isn\u2019t), concerns about missing work, or even local limitations on who is allowed to get tested.\n\nAll of this still means we have a lack of testing, but not necessarily for a lack of trying.\n\nThe U.S. had an opportunity to close the testing gap. During lockdown, strict social distancing helped case numbers drop and lessened the strain on health care systems. As soon as states ease restrictions and begin to allow businesses to reopen, cases are bound to rise. But if, during lockdown, states had ramped up testing dramatically by creating a strong supply chain and expanding testing parameters beyond actively sick individuals,, they would have had the necessary infrastructure to address future rises in cases, according to Tsai.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nInstead, states gradually increased testing while simultaneously lifting restrictions, a double-whammy that all but guaranteed the surge in cases we\u2019re seeing now, with little ability to nip local outbreaks in the bud.\n\nThink of it like a forest fire (an analogy a few experts have been using). If you have a handful of small brush fires, you can find them and control them. If you don\u2019t know they\u2019re there, they can quickly turn into a raging forest fire that is much harder to control. Without sufficient testing when cases are low, those cases can go undetected, possibly by people who have mild or no symptoms and are out in the community spreading the disease to more people. This becomes an even higher risk as cities and states start to reopen.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough right now because the case numbers are so high that to do really efficient testing, tracing, and isolation, we\u2019re going to need a whole lot of tests,\u201d said Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University.\n\nThere are some experts who argue we don\u2019t need to dramatically increase testing further, such as Hochman, who has written on the topic. Hochman argues the current level of testing should be sufficient to inform public health responses. But the problem is we\u2019re not executing those responses well, either.\n\n\u201cMasks, social distancing and hygiene are the three things that make the biggest difference, and testing is probably four or five on that list,\u201d Hochman said.\n\nTesting on its own doesn\u2019t equal success in the battle against the novel coronavirus. But for the U.S., our failure to sufficiently test enough people is representative of the many challenges we face.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/america-is-testing-for-covid-19-more-than-ever-and-it-still-isnt-enough/", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers"]}, {"title": "Voter Registrations Are Way, Way Down During The Pandemic", "text": "Poll after poll showed a high level of enthusiasm for voting in the general election in 2020, and in the beginning of the year, voter registration surged to match that excitement. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. New registrations have fallen off a cliff.\n\nThe spring of a presidential election year is often a busy time for adding new voters to the rolls, and a recent report from the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit organization that aims to improve voter turnout and election security, shows registration numbers were even stronger in early 2020 than early 2016. But things changed dramatically in March, at least in the 12 places where FiveThirtyEight or CEIR were able to obtain data on new voters, a category that includes first-time voters, voters who recently moved to the state and, in some states (Texas, for example) even voters who moved between counties in the state.\n\nConsider Florida, for example, where 109,859 new voters registered in February of this year, compared to 87,351 registrants in February of 2016. But in April 2020, only 21,031 new voters registered, compared with 52,508 in 2016. The same pattern holds in 10 other states, plus Washington, D.C.: Each one registered fewer new voters in April 2020 than in April 2016, including in states where online voter registration is available.\n\nCurrently, 39 states plus Washington, D.C., offer the ability to register to vote online, and a 40th (Oklahoma) is expected to implement it this year. However, in the three places for which we have the relevant data (Florida, Maryland and Washington), online voter registration has not taken off during the pandemic \u2014 certainly not enough to make up for the lost in-person registrations. Even in Washington, where online registrations have ticked up since the beginning of the year, the pace is comparable to 2016: 2,956 people registered online in April and May 2020, similar to the 2,771 people who registered online in April and May 2016.\n\nThe fact that new voter registrations were outpacing the 2016 numbers in January and February was predictable, according to David Becker, the executive director and founder of CEIR. For one thing, population growth means that voter registration always climbs a bit, he said. The expansion of automatic voter registration makes getting on the rolls more convenient than ever in many states, too. Voters were also clearly interested in registering, Becker said.\n\n\u201cEvery piece of data we had looked at with regard to enthusiasm about engaging in this presidential election cycle indicated that we had to be prepared for the highest-turnout presidential election that almost anyone living had ever seen,\u201d Becker said, \u201cwhich makes the decline in March and especially April all the more striking.\u201d\n\nBased on the timing, it seems safe to assume that COVID-19 had something to do with the drop-off, but there\u2019s data to back that assumption up, too. In addition to how many new voters register, some states track how these new voters get their name on the books. In 2016 and in the pre-pandemic months of 2020, in-person registration at places like departments of motor vehicles made up a large plurality, or even a majority, of new registrants in the four places for which we have data on how new voters are registering. But after the pandemic caused most states to shutter many government offices, those registrations dwindled. By contrast, remote registrations (e.g., online or by mail) held relatively steady.\n\n\u201cThis is completely expected, but very concerning,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cThe coronavirus shut down most of the primary avenues through which Americans register to vote: government offices, and all the malls, theaters and public places where voter registration drives operate.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the closing of schools and public events like festivals has hindered in-person voter registration drives run by third-party organizations. \u201cWe had planned to go to 850 high schools leading up to graduation, but as schools closed, that work was clearly disrupted,\u201d said Jeanette Senecal, a senior director for the League of Women Voters who focuses on voter education.\n\nFor example, in Florida, third-party organizations registered 14,144 voters in January 2020 \u2014 a huge increase from the 1,196 they registered in January 2016. But in April 2020, they registered only 133 voters \u2014 down from 3,806 in April 2016.\n\nStates and third-party groups can still get around social distancing restrictions to get more voters on the poll books, though. Voto Latino, an organization that works to register and encourage Latino Americans to vote, has been operating digitally almost since its inception and was well prepared to continue its work during a pandemic. It uses digital campaigns to help voters register, which can even work in states like Texas, which does not have online voter registration \u2014 Voto Latino created an app that makes it easy to fill out the required form, which is then emailed to the voter to print off and mail in.\n\nDanny Turkel, the communications manager for Voto Latino, said the group has actually seen a surge in voter registration, especially since protests in response to the killing of George Floyd began. \u201cOur original goal entering 2020 was to register 500,000 voters,\u201d said Turkel. \u201cAs the numbers have come in and surged, we are now thinking that we could surpass 500,000.\u201d\n\nSo what kind of people might have registered if the coronavirus hadn\u2019t struck? Well for one thing, they\u2019re probably disproportionately young. \u201cIn any given year, far more young people register than older people, just because 18-year-olds age in [to being able to vote] and young people are more likely to move\u201d and need to register at a new address, said Kevin Morris, a quantitative researcher focusing on voting rights and elections at the Brennan Center. According to Morris\u2019s data, 57 percent of new registrants in Florida in the first four months of 2016 were under the age of 40, as were 65 percent of new registrants in Georgia. While the proportions were similar in the beginning of 2020, the total number was much lower than in the past, which means that lots of young people aren\u2019t registering as usual in at least two key 2020 swing states.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew voter registrations have nosedived during COVID-19\n\nSome of these delayed registrants may never end up registering at all. Though we don\u2019t have data for how a pandemic has affected registration in the past (since the U.S. hasn\u2019t faced a similar situation for a good century), Weiser cited another instance when voter registration dipped due to extenuating circumstances. In May of 2011, Florida passed a new bill that placed tough restrictions on third-party voter registration organizations, prompting many of them, such as the League of Women Voters, to stop operating in the state. The restrictions were suspended by a judge in May 2012 but the damage had been done; a subsequent study found that about 14 percent fewer voters registered in 2011 compared to the same period in 2007, with a notable drop following the introduction of the bill \u2014 and those registrations never completely caught up. In 2008, more than 1 million new voters registered in Florida. In 2012, fewer than 900,000 did, according to the state\u2019s voter registration data.\n\nOf course, one unusual law in Florida isn\u2019t exactly analogous to a pandemic, and it\u2019s possible that the high level of enthusiasm for this election will be enough to close the gap that COVID-19 created, especially as states begin to reopen and voters return to registration sites like the DMV. So it\u2019s difficult to know whether this drop in registrations is permanent. But it is clear that despite voters\u2019 intense interest in this election, the coronavirus has already made it harder for new voters to participate in it.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-registrations-are-way-way-down-during-the-pandemic", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers", "Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "It\u2019s Time To Give Basketball\u2019s Other GOAT Her Due", "text": "ESPN recently finished airing a 10-part documentary, \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d that gave Michael Jordan the last word on his career narrative, solidifying his place atop the NBA\u2019s GOAT hierarchy. And by the numbers, that\u2019s exactly where MJ belongs. But now it\u2019s time to give some love to another hoops GOAT, this one on the women\u2019s side: former Houston Comets guard Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. (She went by Cynthia Cooper during her playing career, but she uses her married name now.) At the same time that Jordan\u2019s last dance was playing out, Cooper-Dyke was dominating the WNBA just like Mike was the NBA \u2014 establishing a statistical record that still hasn\u2019t been surpassed.\n\nCooper-Dyke, who\u2019s now the coach of the Texas Southern women\u2019s basketball team, had been a good player in college at Southern California in the mid-1980s, averaging 17.2 points a contest in her senior season. But she was often overshadowed by teammates Cheryl Miller and Pam and Paula McGee, all of whom were named All-Americans (an honor Cooper-Dyke never received) as part of a dominating Trojans team that went 114-15, won two championships and visited another NCAA final during Cooper-Dyke\u2019s career.\n\nMiller was often regarded as the Michael Jordan of women\u2019s basketball by the time she finished her storied career, and Cooper-Dyke sometimes chafed in her shadow. \u201cThere was always this friction/competition between Cheryl and I,\u201d Cooper-Dyke said in \u201cWomen of Troy,\u201d an HBO documentary about USC\u2019s \u201980s dynasty. \u201cI think she had something to prove, and I definitely had a chip on my shoulder having to prove to her and everyone watching that, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m kind of talented too.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Cooper-Dyke\u2019s skills were evident even then, particularly when she was named to the NCAA\u2019s All-Tournament team in 1986 after averaging 19.0 points per game on 54.3 percent shooting during USC\u2019s journey to the championship game.\n\nBecause of the lack of professional opportunities for women\u2019s players at the time \u2014 the WNBA wouldn\u2019t exist for another 11 years after Cooper-Dyke left college \u2014 Cooper-Dyke had to play in Europe, bouncing between teams in Spain and Italy for a decade while producing some incredible stats along the way. In her lone season with Samoa Betera, for instance, Cooper-Dyke led the Spanish league in scoring with 45 points per game, according to her autobiography. She had unlocked a part of her game that had been lurking under the surface at USC.\n\n\u201cI was pumped,\u201d Cooper-Dyke wrote. \u201cNot only was it my first professional experience, but it was the first time I had been a go-to player. I finally had my first real opportunity to showcase my talent. I was ready to shout \u2014 \u2018Hey! Look at me. I\u2019m on the scene.\u2019\u201d\n\nCooper-Dyke would go on to lead her league in scoring eight times during her 10 years overseas, never finishing any lower than second. She also won a variety of gold medals for Team USA, including at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. By the beginning of 1997, when the was WNBA preparing a list of players for its inaugural allocation draft, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s exploits in Europe were enough put her in the initial group of 16 franchise players used to seed the league\u2019s eight teams \u2014 along with superstars such as Lisa Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes, Teresa Weatherspoon and Rebecca Lobo.\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown\n\nStill, Cooper-Dyke was somewhat unknown to American fans on the eve of the WNBA\u2019s debut. \u201cNobody was following what was going on overseas, but she was dominating the Italian league, [she was] the leading scorer, won championships,\u201d Hall of Famer Ticha Penicheiro said in a WNBA feature on Cooper-Dyke. \u201cPeople just didn\u2019t know about her.\u201d\n\nThat changed in a hurry during the WNBA\u2019s initial season. Cooper-Dyke was instantly and obviously the new league\u2019s best player: She won MVP honors while leading the Comets to the league\u2019s best record and the first-ever WNBA championship. She also swept the league\u2019s advanced-stats leaderboard, finishing No. 1 in player efficiency rating, win shares and win shares per 40 minutes. According to a composite mix of PER and WS/40 designed to mimic our RAPTOR NBA ratings, Cooper-Dyke added 10.6 points per 100 possessions more than average to Houston\u2019s league-leading +8.7 net rating, carrying the Comets while Swoopes missed the majority of the season after giving birth to her son.\n\nCooper-Dyke did it all at 34, too \u2014 well past the prime age for basketball players. It makes you wonder what feats she might have accomplished if the WNBA had existed just a decade earlier. And as great as Cooper-Dyke was in the WNBA\u2019s first season, she was even better in Year 2. In 1998, she once again:\n\nWith apologies to recent accomplishments of Elena Delle Donne and Nneka Ogwumike, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s 1998 may have been the best single-season performance in WNBA history.

Cooper-Dyke\u2019s performance came while logging 35 minutes per game for a team that still holds the record for highest single-season winning percentage (.900) in league history. That season, Cooper-Dyke had as thorough a stranglehold on the WNBA as MJ ever had on the NBA in any of his seasons. (And again, she did it at the ripe old age of 35!)\n\nIn 1999, Cooper-Dyke was still dominant, leading the league in win shares (overall and per 40) and composite rating \u2014 although Sacramento\u2019s Yolanda Griffith wrested away the PER crown and MVP honors. The Comets won their third consecutive WNBA title, however, with Cooper-Dyke once again earning Finals MVP honors. It continued a Jordanesque stretch that helped solidify Cooper-Dyke\u2019s place in history as the WNBA\u2019s GOAT.\n\nAnd then, in 2000, the Comets had the most impressive run in the history of women\u2019s pro basketball.\n\nAt age 37, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s individual stats were beginning to decline. She ranked third on the team in composite rating (+6.3) behind Swoopes (+10.5) \u2014 who had fully come into her own as a dominating superstar, winning MVP honors \u2014 and Tina Thompson (+6.5). But the 2000 Comets were the best version of their dynasty teams. After a 27-5 regular season, Houston blazed through the playoffs without losing a single game, as Cooper-Dyke won Finals MVP for a fourth consecutive season with 22.5 points and 6 assists per game against the New York Liberty.\n\nWe can measure Houston\u2019s rise from a new team to a legendary four-time WNBA champion using Elo ratings, a FiveThirtyEight staple. Before each game, Elo assigns each team a rating that essentially represents their current strength; those ratings (after incorporating home-court advantage and other factors) can be turned into win probabilities for both teams. After the game, the ratings are then adjusted based on the result, with the winner gaining Elo points in proportion to how unexpected the victory was. This spring, my colleague Jay Boice created Elo ratings for the WNBA, which follow the same general framework as our other Elo ratings from the NBA and other sports.\n\nAccording to Elo, the 2000 Houston Comets peaked with a rating of 1743 after completing their sweep of the Liberty, which, even two decades later, is still the highest rating ever achieved by a WNBA team.\n\nSadly, the Comets no longer exist, having folded in 2008. But their legacy as the GOAT lives on. The closest any recent WNBA teams have come to matching the Comets\u2019 peak Elo were the 2014 Phoenix Mercury, who topped out at 1736 after sweeping the Sky for the championship, and the 2017 Los Angeles Sparks, who reached a 1729 Elo when they took a 2-1 lead over the Minnesota Lynx in the Finals. (L.A. would go on to lose its next two games \u2014 and the series.) Delle Donne\u2019s 2019 Washington Mystics were the best offensive team in WNBA history, but in terms of Elo, their peak was just 1717, nowhere near the Comets\u2019 best mark.\n\nIn retrospect, Houston was lucky to have randomly drawn both Cooper-Dyke and Swoopes in the WNBA\u2019s initial allocation draft, and then to have taken Thompson No. 1 overall in the regular 1997 draft \u2014 it instantly gave the Comets a trio of all-time legends from the very start. With all three playing to their full potential, surrounded by solid role players like Janeth Arcain, Kim Perrot and Monica Lamb, it\u2019s no wonder that Houston blossomed into a historic dynasty.\n\nBut at the center of it all was Cooper-Dyke, who retired after that 2000 season at the top of the basketball world (before making a brief, four-game comeback in 2003). To this day, she remains the WNBA\u2019s all-time leader in PER (28.7), win shares per 40 (.335) and composite rating (+9.0), with Jackson and Delle Donne distantly tied behind her at +7.3. Statistically, Cooper-Dyke is the best ever on a per-possession basis, and it isn\u2019t particularly close:\n\nCooper-Dyke dominated each and every possession Best composite ratings \u2014 based on a mix of player efficiency rating (PER) and win shares per 40 minutes \u2014 for WNBA players with at least 2,250 career minutes played, 1997-2019 Player Games Minutes PER WS/40 Composite Rating Cynthia Cooper 124 4,363 28.7 .335 +9.0 Elena Delle Donne 190 5,900 28.7 .289 +7.3 Lauren Jackson 317 10,130 28.0 .288 +7.3 Nneka Ogwumike 250 7,309 25.8 .267 +6.4 Yolanda Griffith 311 8,956 25.4 .265 +6.3 Tamika Catchings 457 14,387 26.1 .260 +6.1 Jonquel Jones 136 3,126 25.0 .254 +6.0 Maya Moore 271 8,466 24.6 .253 +6.0 Sylvia Fowles 340 10,387 25.2 .240 +5.6 Breanna Stewart 101 3,339 25.3 .225 +5.2 Candace Parker 315 9,836 25.3 .216 +4.9 Liz Cambage 117 2,910 26.5 .207 +4.7 Brittney Griner 212 6,481 24.8 .213 +4.7 Lisa Leslie 363 11,634 24.3 .206 +4.6 Sheryl Swoopes 324 10,591 23.3 .212 +4.5 Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nCooper-Dyke is the only four-time (or even three-time) Finals MVP in league history, and she is still the only back-to-back league MVP winner.

In fact, now that Jordan\u2019s film is in the books, and once they finish telling Tom Brady\u2019s tale, maybe Cooper-Dyke should be the subject of ESPN\u2019s next documentary about GOAT athletes.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-time-to-give-basketballs-other-goat-her-due/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "We\u2019ve Updated Our Pollster Ratings Ahead Of The 2020 General Election", "text": "The competitive phase of the 2020 presidential primaries is over \u2014 which means we\u2019ve updated FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings. These ratings cover this year\u2019s presidential primaries, the 2019 gubernatorial elections and the occasional straggler poll we only just discovered from a past election. They include polls conducted in the final 21 days before every presidential, U.S. Senate, U.S. House and gubernatorial general election (including special elections), as well as every presidential primary, since 1998. We encourage you to check out the new ratings, especially when a new poll comes out and you want to gauge its reliability.\n\nSo far, it hasn\u2019t been a great year for pollsters. The 2020 presidential primary polls had a weighted average error \u2014 i.e., the absolute difference between a poll\u2019s margin (between the top two candidates) and the actual vote share margin \u2014 of 10.2 percentage points. That\u2019s roughly tied with the 2016 presidential primaries for the biggest error in primary polling this century.\n\nBut we don\u2019t blame pollsters too much for this: They have some good excuses because the 2020 Democratic primary race changed so quickly. In the span of a week (from roughly Feb. 25 to Super Tuesday), former Vice President Joe Biden dramatically reversed his electoral fortunes, and surveys just weren\u2019t able to keep up with how fast the mood of the electorate was changing. We can see that by breaking down the error of 2020 primary polls by election date:\n\nPolls of the contests on Super Tuesday had a weighted average error of 12.8 points, with 60 percent of them conducted mostly before Biden\u2019s big South Carolina win and subsequent endorsements by onetime 2020 presidential contenders former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nSouth Carolina polls had a weighted average error of 17.2 points (!), and 75 percent of them were conducted mostly before Rep. Jim Clyburn\u2019s endorsement of Biden.\n\nPolls of all other contests \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and every post-Super Tuesday state \u2014 had a weighted average error of 7.1 points, which is quite good by historical standards for primary polls.\n\nOne week torpedoed the 2020 primary polls Weighted average error of polls in the final 21 days* before each contest, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Contest Error Iowa 5.3 New Hampshire 4.9 Nevada 8.8 South Carolina 17.2 Super Tuesday 12.8 March 10 9.7 March 17 6.6 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular election date. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *Excluding New Hampshire primary polls taken before the Iowa caucuses, other states\u2019 primary polls taken before the New Hampshire primary, and primary polls whose leader or runner-up dropped out before that primary was held.\n\nIn addition, some pollsters fared better in the 2020 primaries than others. We\u2019d encourage you not to read too much into a pollster\u2019s performance in the 2020 primaries, as it typically takes a larger sample size to ascertain a pollster\u2019s true accuracy. But if there was a \u201cwinner\u201d for the 2020 primaries, it was Monmouth University, whose average error of 7.5 points was the lowest among firms that released five or more primary polls. Probably not by coincidence, Monmouth also has the highest FiveThirtyEight pollster rating overall \u2014 a sterling A+.\n\nIn general, pollsters that use the time-honored methodology of interviewing respondents live over the phone are more reliable than those that use alternative platforms like the internet, and that was mostly true in the 2020 primaries too. Suffolk University, another live-caller pollster, also performed pretty well (an average error of 8.0), although Marist College had an off year (13.3). Among online pollsters, YouGov \u2014 whose online methodology is more proven than most \u2014 excelled with a 7.6-point error, almost matching Monmouth\u2019s accuracy. The pollster with the highest average error (at least among those with five or more polls to analyze) was Change Research, at 16.1 points.\n\nThe best and worst pollsters of the 2020 primaries Average error of polls in the final 21 days* before 2020 presidential primaries and caucuses, for pollsters that conducted at least five polls, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Pollster Methodology No. of Polls Average Error Monmouth University Live 7 7.5 YouGov Online 9 7.6 Suffolk University Live 6 8.0 Emerson College IVR/Online/Text 13 8.5 AtlasIntel Online 8 8.8 Data for Progress Online/Text 29 9.3 Point Blank Political Online/Text 6 10.7 Swayable Online 22 12.0 Marist College Live 6 13.3 University of Massachusetts Lowell Online 6 14.0 Change Research Online 7 16.1 *Excluding New Hampshire primary polls taken before the Iowa caucuses, other states\u2019 primary polls taken before the New Hampshire primary, and primary polls whose leader or runner-up dropped out before that primary was held.\n\nFinally, as is our custom when updating the pollster ratings, let\u2019s take a look at the accuracy of polls as a whole through three different lenses \u2014 error, \u201ccalling\u201d elections correctly and statistical bias \u2014 each with an accompanying heat map.\n\nThe first lens is polling error \u2014 a.k.a. the same metric we\u2019ve been using so far in this article. Here\u2019s the weighted average error of polls for each election cycle since 1998, broken down by office. We already mentioned how polls of the 2020 primaries were not all that accurate historically speaking. But the limited polls we have for governor and U.S. House races this cycle have been pretty accurate so far. They had weighted average errors of 4.9 and 6.0, respectively, which is perfectly normal for these types of elections, although the sample size is still quite small.\n\n2020 primary polls misfired, but the polls are still all right Weighted average error of polls in the final 21 days before elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database President Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 8.2 7.5 7.1 7.7 1999-2000 4.8 6.1 4.4 4.4 7.7 5.6 2001-02 5.2 4.8 5.5 5.2 2003-04 4.8 5.0 5.5 3.2 6.9 4.6 2005-06 5.0 4.2 6.2 5.2 2007-08 4.2 4.7 5.7 3.5 7.6 5.4 2009-10 4.8 4.8 6.7 5.7 2011-12 4.9 4.7 5.3 3.7 9.0 5.3 2013-14 4.6 5.4 6.7 5.4 2015-16 5.4 4.9 5.8 4.9 10.3 6.8 2017-18 5.1 4.3 5.0 4.9 2019-20* 4.9 TBD 6.0 TBD 10.2 TBD All years 5.3 5.2 6.1 4.0 9.3 6.0 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential general elections to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nQuantifying polling error is arguably the best way to think about the accuracy of polls, but there are other lenses too. But say all you care about is whether polls \u201ccalled\u201d the election correctly \u2014 i.e., how often the candidate who led a poll ended up winning the election. We\u2019ve got a heat map for that too (although this isn\u2019t our preferred method, as it\u2019s a bit simplistic). Overall, since 1998, polls have picked the winner 79 percent of the time. And by this measure, the accuracy of 2020 primary polls clocked in at exactly average.\n\nPolls pick the winner 79 percent of the time Weighted average share of polls that correctly identified the winner in the final 21 days before elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database President Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 86% 87% 49% 76% 1999-2000 81 84 54 67% 95% 76 2001-02 87 82 73 81 2003-04 76 82 64 79 94 79 2005-06 89 92 73 84 2007-08 95 95 84 94 79 88 2009-10 85 85 77 82 2011-12 91 87 70 82 62 77 2013-14 80 75 76 77 2015-16 68 78 58 71 86 77 2017-18 74 74 79 75 2019-20* 88 TBD 41 TBD 79 TBD All years 82 83 72 79 81 79 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential general elections to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nFrankly, though, this isn\u2019t a great way to think about polls. Say a poll had the Republican ahead by 1 point but the Democrat ended up winning the election by 1 point \u2014 that\u2019s a pretty accurate result even though the winner was incorrectly identified. On the other hand, if the Republican ended up winning by 20 points, the poll did correctly identify the winner \u2014 but the absolute error was quite large.\n\nAdditionally, polls of close elections unsurprisingly make the wrong call much more frequently than races where there is no doubt which candidate is going to win. In both the 2020 primaries and overall, polls showing a blowout (i.e., the leader led by 20 points or more) picked the correct winner almost all the time, but they were right only about half the time when they showed a lead smaller than 3 points.\n\nPolls often miss close races Share of polls that correctly identified the winner in the final 21 days before elections, by how close the poll showed the race % of Polls Picking Winner Margin 2020 Primaries All Races Since 1998 <3 pts 46% 57% 3-6 72 70 6-10 79 84 10-15 75 93 15-20 82 97 \u226520 98 99 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nThis is why, when a poll shows a close race, your takeaway shouldn\u2019t be, \u201cThis candidate leads by 1 point!\u201d but rather, \u201cThis race is a toss-up.\u201d Polls\u2019 true utility isn\u2019t in telling us who will win, but rather in roughly how close a race is \u2014 and, therefore, how confident we should be in the outcome.\n\nThe third and final lens we\u2019ll use is polls\u2019 statistical bias. Statistical bias is different from error in that it tells us in which direction the error ran \u2014 i.e., did the polls consistently under- or overrate a specific political party? Not much has changed in this final table since the last time we published it, because we exclude presidential primaries from calculations of statistical bias (since all primary candidates belong to the same party), but we think it\u2019s worth reemphasizing its findings as we enter the 2020 general election.\n\nPolling bias is small and unpredictable Weighted average statistical bias of polls in the final 21 days before general elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House President Combined 1998 R+5.6 R+4.5 R+0.8 R+3.8 1999-2000 R+0.4 R+2.7 D+1.2 R+2.4 R+1.9 2001-02 D+3.0 D+1.3 D+1.5 D+2.2 2003-04 D+1.7 D+1.1 D+2.7 D+1.1 D+1.5 2005-06 D+0.2 R+1.3 D+0.7 D+0.0 2007-08 R+0.1 D+0.4 D+1.1 D+1.0 D+0.8 2009-10 R+0.1 R+0.7 D+1.7 D+0.6 2011-12 R+1.6 R+3.1 R+2.9 R+2.5 R+2.8 2013-14 D+2.3 D+2.6 D+3.8 D+2.7 2015-16 D+3.3 D+2.7 D+4.1 D+3.3 D+3.0 2017-18 R+0.9 D+0.1 R+0.6 R+0.5 2019-20* D+2.9 TBD D+6.0 TBD TBD All years D+0.5 D+0.1 D+0.8 D+0.3 D+0.3 Bias is calculated only for elections where the top two finishers were a Republican and a Democrat. Therefore, it is not calculated for presidential primaries. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential races to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nThose findings: Over the long term, there is no meaningful partisan statistical bias in polling. All the polls in our data set combine for a weighted average statistical bias of 0.3 points toward Democrats. Individual election cycles can have more significant biases \u2014 and, importantly, it usually runs in the same direction for every office \u2014 but there is no pattern from year to year. In other words, just because polls overestimated Democrats in 2016 does not mean they will do the same in 2020. It\u2019s good to be aware of the potential for polling error heading into the election, but that error could benefit either party. In fact, we\u2019ve observed that preelection attempts to guess which way the polling error will run seem to have an uncanny knack for being wrong \u2014 which could be a coincidence or could reflect very real overcompensation.\n\nSo despite a rocky primary season, we recommend that you trust the polls in 2020. Of course, \u201ctrust the polls\u201d doesn\u2019t mean trust all the polls; that\u2019s why we have our pollster ratings. In addition to our handy letter grades, that page contains each pollster\u2019s average error, statistical bias and the share of races it called correctly, plus details on whether it adheres to methodological best practices and a lot more. You can also download our entire pollster ratings data set, including all the polls that went into the tables in this article, to investigate further on your own. (Wondering how much more accurate live-caller polls are than online ones? Or which state\u2019s polls are the most error-prone? Wonder no more.)\n\nFor a detailed methodology of the pollster ratings, check out this 2014 article; we made a few tweaks in 2016 and 2019, such as giving a \u201cslashed\u201d letter grade (e.g., \u201cA/B\u201d) to pollsters with a smaller body of work. There are no methodological changes this year, except we do have a bit of housekeeping that probably only pollsters will be interested in: Starting with our next pollster ratings update (after the 2020 elections), we will no longer give active pollsters a ratings boost for once belonging to the National Council on Public Polls (a now-defunct polling consortium whose members were committed to methodological transparency). Active pollsters will need to participate in the American Association for Public Opinion Research\u2019s Transparency Initiative or contribute to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archive to get credit in the \u201cNCPP/AAPOR/Roper\u201d column, which also determines which pollsters we consider \u201cgold standard.\u201d As always, if anyone has any questions about any aspect of the pollster ratings, you can always reach us at polls@fivethirtyeight.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Does Trump Really Want A Fight With Obama?", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weve-updated-our-pollster-ratings-ahead-of-the-2020-general-election/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "The State Of The Polls, 2019", "text": "The State Of The Polls, 2019 Polls just had one of their best election cycles, ever \u2014 but challenges abound in the industry\n\nMuch maligned for their performance in the 2016 general election \u2014 and somewhat unfairly so, since the overall accuracy of the polls was only slightly below average that year by historical standards \u2014 American election polls have been quite accurate since then. Their performance was very strong in the 2018 midterms, despite the challenge of having to poll dozens of diverse congressional districts around the country, many of which had not had a competitive election in years. Polls have also generally been accurate in the various special elections and off-year gubernatorial elections that have occurred since 2016, even though those are also often difficult races to poll.\n\n[Related: FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings]\n\nDoes that mean everything is looking up in the industry? Well, no. We\u2019ll introduce some complications in a moment. But I do want to re-emphasize that opening takeaway, since the media is just flatly wrong when it asserts that the polls can\u2019t be trusted. In fact, American election polls are about as accurate as they\u2019ve always been. That doesn\u2019t mean polls will always identify the right winner, especially in close elections. (As a simple rule of thumb, we\u2019ve found polls \u201ccall\u201d the right winner 80 percent of the time, meaning they fail to do so the other 20 percent of the time \u2014 although upsets are more likely to occur in some circumstances than others.) But the rate of upsets hasn\u2019t changed much over time.\n\nBefore we go any further, I want to direct you to the latest version of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings, which we\u2019ve updated for the first time since May 2018. They include all polls in the three weeks leading up to every U.S. House, U.S. Senate and gubernatorial general election since then, including special elections, plus a handful of polls from past years that were missing from previous versions of our database. You can find much more detail on the pollster ratings here, including all the polls used in the ratings calculation. Our presidential approval ratings, generic congressional ballot and impeachment trackers have also been updated to reflect these new ratings, although they make little difference to the topline numbers.\n\nNow then, for those complications: The main one is simply that response rates to traditional telephone polls continue to decline. In large part because of caller-ID and call-blocking technologies, it\u2019s simply harder than it used to be to get people to answer phone calls from people they don\u2019t know. In addition to potentially making polls less accurate, that also makes them more expensive, since a pollster has to spend more time making calls for every completed response that it gets. As a result, the overall number of polls has begun to slightly decline. There were 532 polls in our pollster ratings database, which covers polls in the 21 days before elections occur, associated with elections on Nov. 6, 2018, which is down from 558 polls for Election Day 2014 and 692 polls for Election Day 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The races we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching on Election Day 2019\n\nSo why not turn to online polls or other new technologies? Well, the problem is that in recent elections, polls that use live interviewers to call both landlines and cellphones continue to outperform other methods, such as online and automated (IVR) polls. Moreover, online and IVR polls are generally more prone toward herding \u2014 that is, making methodological choices, or picking and choosing which results they publish, in ways that make their polls match other, more traditional polls. So not only are online and automated polls somewhat less accurate than live-caller polls, but they\u2019d probably suffer a further decline in accuracy if they didn\u2019t have live polls to herd toward.\n\nStill, online polling is undoubtedly a large part of polling\u2019s future \u2014 and some online polling firms are more accurate than others. Among the most prolific online pollsters, for example, YouGov stands out for being more accurate than others such as Zogby, SurveyMonkey, and Harris Insights & Analytics. And many former IVR pollsters are now migrating to hybrid methods that combine automated phone polling with internet panels. In the 2018 elections, this produced better results in some cases (e.g., SurveyUSA) than in others (e.g., Rasmussen Reports).\n\nPolls have been quite accurate \u2014 and unbiased \u2014 in post-2016 elections\n\nEach time we update our pollster ratings, we publish a few charts that depict the overall health of the industry \u2014 so let\u2019s go ahead and run the numbers again. The first chart is the one we consider to be the most important: the average error of polls broken down by the type of election. A few quick methodological notes:\n\nBy average error, I mean the difference between the margin projected by the poll and the actual election result. For instance, if the poll shows the Democrat up by 1 percentage point and the Republican wins by 2 points, that would be a 3-point error.\n\nTo not give any one polling firm too much influence, the values in the chart are weighted based on the number of polls a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle\n\nPolls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect that they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nNote that I\u2019ve included the handful of elections that have occurred so far in 2019 with the 2017-18 election cycle, even though we\u2019ll classify them them later as part of the 2019-20 cycle instead.\n\nOK, here\u2019s the data:\n\nPost-2016 polls have been accurate by historical standards Weighted-average error of polls in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Presidential Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 8.2 7.4 6.8 7.6 1999-2000 4.9 6.1 4.4 4.4 7.6 5.5 2001-02 5.2 4.9 5.4 5.2 2003-04 6.0 5.6 5.4 3.2 7.1 4.8 2005-06 5.0 4.2 6.5 5.3 2007-08 4.1 4.7 5.7 3.6 7.4 5.4 2009-10 4.9 4.8 6.9 5.7 2011-12 4.9 4.7 5.1 3.6 8.9 5.2 2013-14 4.6 5.5 6.5 5.4 2015-16 5.4 5.0 5.5 4.8 10.1 6.7 2017-19 5.3 4.3 5.0 5.0 All years 5.4 5.3 6.1 4.0 8.7 5.8 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nAs I said, the 2017-19 cycle was one of the most accurate on record for polling. The average error of 5.0 points in polls of U.S. House elections is the second-best in our database, trailing only 1999-2000. The 4.3-point error associated with U.S. Senate elections is also the second-best, slightly trailing 2005-06. And gubernatorial polls had an average error of 5.3 points, which is about average by historical standards.\n\nCombining all different types of elections together, we find that polls from 2017 onward have been associated with an average error of 5.0 points, which is considerably better than the 6.7-point average for 2015-16, and the best in any election cycle since 2003-04.\n\nBut note that there\u2019s just not much of an overall trajectory \u2014 upward or downward \u2014 in polling accuracy. Relatively strong cycles for the polls can be followed by relatively weak ones, and vice versa.\n\nOne more key reminder now that the Iowa caucuses are only three months away: Some types of elections are associated with considerably larger polling errors than others. In particular, presidential primaries feature polling that is often volatile at best, and downright inaccurate at worst. Overall, presidential primary polls in our database mispredict the final margin between the top two candidates by an average of 8.7 points. And the error was even worse, 10.1 points, in the 2016 primary cycle. Leads of 10 points, 15 points or sometimes more are not necessarily safe in the primaries.\n\nWe can also look at polling accuracy by simply counting up how often the candidate leading in the poll wins his or her race. This isn\u2019t our preferred method, as it\u2019s a bit simplistic \u2014 if a poll had the Republican ahead by 1 point and the Democrat won by 1 point, that\u2019s a much more accurate result than if the Republican had won by 20, even though it would have incorrectly identified the winner. But across all polls in our database, the winner was \u201ccalled\u201d 79 percent of the time.\n\nPolls \u201ccall\u201d the winner right 79 percent of the time Weighted-average share of polls that correctly identified the winner in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Presidential Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 86% 86% 57% 78% 1999-2000 80 80 56 68% 95% 76 2001-2002 87 87 77 82 2003-2004 76 76 69 78 94 79 2005-2006 89 89 71 83 2007-2008 95 95 83 94 80 88 2009-2010 85 85 75 82 2011-2012 90 90 70 81 63 77 2013-2014 80 80 76 77 2015-2016 68 68 57 71 86 77 2017-2019 77 77 78 76 All years 82 82 72 79 83 79 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nIn recent elections, the winning percentage has been slightly below the long-term average \u2014 it was 76 percent in 2017-19. But this reflects the recent uptick in close elections, and that resource-constrained pollsters tend to poll these close elections more heavily.\n\nAs basic as this analysis is, it\u2019s essential to remember that polls are much more likely to misidentify the winner when they show a close race. Polls in our database that showed a lead of 3 percentage points or less identified the winner only 58 percent of the time \u2014 a bit better than random chance, but not much better. But polls showing a 3- or 6-point lead were right 72 percent of the time, and those with a 6- or 10-point lead were right 86 percent of the time. (Errors in races showing double-digit leads are quite rare in general elections, although they occur with some frequency in primaries. And errors in races where one candidate leads by 20 or more points are once-in-a-blue-moon types of events, regardless of the type of election.)\n\nPolls often misidentify the winner in a close race Share of polls that correctly identified the winner in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Leading candidate\u2019s margin Share of polls correctly identifying winner 0-3 points 58% \u2013 \u2013 3-6 points 72 \u2013 \u2013 6-10 points 86 \u2013 \u2013 10-15 points 94 \u2013 \u2013 15-20 points 98 \u2013 \u2013 \u226520 points >99 \u2013 \u2013 Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nAnother essential measure of polling accuracy is statistical bias \u2014 that is, whether the polls tend to miss in the same direction. We\u2019re particularly interested in understanding whether polls systematically favor Democrats or Republicans. Take the polls in 2016, for instance. Although they weren\u2019t that bad from an accuracy standpoint, the majority underestimated President Trump and Republicans running for Congress and governor, leading them to underestimate how well Trump would do in the Electoral College. Overall in the 2015-16 cycle, polls had a Democratic bias (meaning they overestimated Democrats and underestimated Republicans) of 3.0 percentage points. And that after a 2013-14 cycle when polls also had a Democratic bias (of 2.7 percentage points).\n\nPolling bias is not very consistent from cycle to cycle Weighted-average statistical bias of polls in final 21 days of the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House Pres.

Therefore, it is not calculated for presidential primaries. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nIn 2017-19, however, polls had essentially no partisan bias, and to the extent there was one, it was a very slight bias toward Republicans (0.3 percentage points). And that\u2019s been the long-term pattern: Whatever bias there is in one batch of election polls doesn\u2019t tend to persist from one cycle to the next. The Republican bias in the polls in 2011-12, for instance, which tended to underestimate then-President Obama\u2019s re-election margins, was followed by two cycles of Democratic bias in 2013-14 and 2015-16, as previously mentioned. There is simply not much point in trying to guess the direction of poll bias ahead of time; if anything, it often seems to go against what the conventional wisdom expects. Instead, you should always be prepared for the possibility of systematic polling errors of several percentage points in either direction.\n\nWhich pollsters have been most accurate in recent elections?\n\nAlthough it can be dangerous to put too much stock in the performance of a pollster in a single election cycle \u2014 it takes dozens of polls to reliably assess a pollster\u2019s accuracy \u2014 it\u2019s nonetheless worth briefly remarking on the recent performance of some of the more prolific ones. Below, you\u2019ll find the average error, statistical bias and a calculation we call Advanced Plus-Minus (basically, how the pollster\u2019s average error compares to other pollsters\u2019 in the same election), for pollsters with at least five polls in our database for the 2017-19 cycle. Note that negative Advanced Plus-Minus scores are good; they indicate that a firm\u2019s polls were more accurate than others in the same races.\n\nHow prolific pollsters have fared in recent elections Advanced Plus-Minus scores and other metrics for pollsters who conducted at least five surveys for the 2017-19 cycle, in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Pollster Methodology No. of Polls Avg.

In exciting news for fans of innovative polling, the list includes polls from our friends at The New York Times\u2019s Upshot, who launched an extremely successful and accurate polling collaboration with Siena College in 2016. (It also includes ABC News, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s corporate parent, which usually conducts its polls jointly with The Washington Post.)\n\nConversely, the five of the top six worst-performing pollsters \u2014 including firms such as Carroll Strategies, Dixie Strategies, and Rasmussen Reports/Pulse Opinion Research \u2014 were IVR pollsters (sometimes in conjunction with other methods), several of which had strong Republican leans in 2017-19. Some IVR pollsters did perform reasonably well in 2015-16, a cycle where most pollsters underestimated Republicans. In retrospect, though, that may have been a case of two wrongs making a right; IVR polls tend to be Republican-leaning, so they\u2019ll look good in years where Republicans beat their polls, but they\u2019ll often be among the worst polls otherwise.\n\nIndeed, aggregating the pollsters by methodology confirms that live caller polls continue to be the most accurate. Below are the aggregate scores for the three major categories of polls \u2014 live caller, online, and IVR \u2014 by our Advanced Plus-Minus metric, average error and statistical bias.\n\nLive-caller polls have been most accurate in recent elections Advanced Plus-Minus scores and other metrics for pollsters who conducted at least five surveys for the 2017-19 cycle, in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Methodology No. of Polls Avg.

Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nThe differences are clearest when looking at pollsters that exclusively used one method. Polls that exclusively used live callers (including calling cellphones) had an average error of 4.4 percentage points in the 2017-19 cycle, as compared to 5.0 points for polls exclusively conducted online or via text message, and 6.9 points for polls that exclusively used IVR. (Pure IVR polls, however, are now quite rare. Polls that used a hybrid of IVR and other methods did better, with an average error of 5.0 percentage points.)\n\nPolling firms that are members of professional polling organizations that push for transparency and other best practices also continue to outperform those that aren\u2019t. In particular, our pollster ratings give credit to firms that support the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Transparency Initiative, belong to the National Council on Public Polls (NCPP), or contribute data to the Roper Center archive. Pollsters that are part of one or more of these initiatives had an average error of 4.3 percentage points in the 2017-19 cycle, as compared to 5.4 percentage points for those that aren\u2019t.\n\nAnother way to detect herding\n\nOur pollster ratings have also long included an adjustment to account for the fact that online and automated polls tend to perform better when there are high-quality polls in the field. We\u2019ve confirmed that this still applies. For instance, polls that are conducted online or via IVR are about 0.4 percentage points more accurate based on our Advanced Plus-Minus metric when their polls are preceded by \u201cgold standard\u201d polls in the same race. (\u201cGold standard\u201d is the term we use for pollsters that are exclusively live caller with cellphones and are also AAPOR/NCPP/Roper members.) Live-caller polls do not exhibit the same pattern, however; their Advanced Plus-Minus score is unaffected by the existence of an earlier \u201cgold standard\u201d poll in the field. This is probably the result of herding; some of the lower-quality pollsters may be doing the equivalent of peeking at their more studious classmate\u2019s answers in a math test. In fact, these differences are especially strong in recent elections, suggesting that herding has become more of a problem.\n\nThere is also a second, more direct method to detect herding, which we\u2019re also now applying in our pollster ratings. Namely \u2014 as described in this story \u2014 there is a minimum distance that a poll should be from the average of previous polls based on sampling error alone. For instance, even if you knew that a candidate was ahead 48-41 in a particular race \u2014 a 7-point lead \u2014 you\u2019d miss that margin by an average of about 5 percentage points in a 600-person poll because sampling only 600 people rather than the entire population introduces sampling error. That is, because of sampling error, some polls would inevitably show a 12-point lead and some would show a 2-point lead instead of all the polls being bunched together at a 6- or 7- or 8-point lead exactly. If the polls are very tightly bunched together, this is not a good thing \u2014 you should be suspicious of herding, which can sometimes yield embarrassing outcomes where every poll gets the answer wrong\n\nOf course, there are other complications in the real world. There\u2019s no guarantee that the race will have been static since other pollsters surveyed the race; one candidate may be losing or gaining ground. And pollsters have healthy methodological disagreements from one another, so the same race may look different depending on what assumptions they make about turnout and so forth. But these should tend to increase the degree to which polls differ from each other, and not produce herding.\n\nBut our herding penalty only applies if pollsters show too little variation from the average of previous polls of the race based on sampling error alone. If a pollster is publishing all its data without being influenced by other pollsters \u2014 including its supposed outliers \u2014 it should be fairly easy to avoid this penalty over the long run.\n\nMany polls are closer to the average of previous polls than they \u201cshould\u201d be, however. Unlike the previous type of herding I described, which is concentrated among lower-quality pollsters who are essentially trying to draft off their neighbors to get better results, this tendency appears among some higher-quality pollsters as well. In some cases, we suspect, this is because, late in the race, a pollster doesn\u2019t want to deal with the media firestorm that would inevitably ensue if it published a poll that appears to be an outlier. In other cases, frankly, we suspect that pollsters rather explicitly look at the FiveThirtyEight or RealClearPolitics polling average and attempt to match it.\n\nIn any event, our formula now detects this type of herding, and it results in a lower pollster rating when we catch it. . Our pollster ratings spreadsheet now calculates each pollster\u2019s Average Distance from Polling Average, or ADPA, which is how much the pollster\u2019s average poll differs from the average of previous polls of that race. Among pollsters with at least 15 polls, the largest herding penalties are as follows:\n\nWhich pollsters show the clearest signs of herding? Pollster Herding Penalty Research Co. 1.17 Muhlenberg College 0.84 Angus Reid Global 0.82 Grove Insight 0.71 NBC News/Wall Street Journal 0.53 The list is limited to pollsters with at least 15 polls for which an average of previous polls can be computed.\n\nOther methodological changes\n\nUnless you\u2019re really into details \u2014 or you\u2019re a pollster! \u2014 you probably aren\u2019t going to care about these \u2026 but there are a few other methodological changes we\u2019ve made to our pollster ratings this year.\n\nPreviously, pollsters got a bonus if they exclusively conducted their polls via live callers with cellphones, since these have been the most accurate polls over time. But this year, if a pollster uses live-caller-with-cellphone polls in combination with other methodologies, we now give them partial credit for the live-caller bonus. Even though these hybrid polls did not have a particularly good performance in 2017-19, they\u2019ve been reasonably strong in the long run; also, we\u2019re bowing to the reality that many formerly live pollsters are increasingly incorporating online or other methods into their repertoire.\n\nIn determining whether a poll\u2019s result fell into or outside the margin of error, a calculation that\u2019s available in our spreadsheet, we now use a more sophisticated margin of error formula that accounts for the percentages of the top two candidates and not just the distance between them. The margin of error is smaller in lopsided races, e.g., when one candidate leads 70-20.\n\nOur Predictive Plus-Minus scores and pollster letter grades are based on a combination of a pollster\u2019s empirical performance (how accurate it has been in the past) and its methodological characteristics. The more polls a firm has conducted, the more the formula weights its performance rather than its methodological prior. In assigning the weights, our formula now considers how recent a particular firm\u2019s polls were. In other words, if a pollster has conducted a lot of surveys recently, its empirical accuracy will be more heavily weighted. But if most of its polling is in the distant past, its pollster rating will gradually revert toward the mean based on its methodology.\n\nFor pollsters with a relatively small sample of polling, we now show a provisional rating rather than a precise letter grade. (An \u201cA/B\u201d provisional rating means that the pollster has shown strong initial results, a \u201cB/C\u201d rating means it has average initial results, and a \u201cC/D\u201d rating means below-average initial results.) It now takes roughly 20 recent polls (or a larger number of older polls) for a pollster to get a precise pollster rating.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now!

Good luck to pollsters on having a strong performance in the primaries.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-state-of-the-polls-2019/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "The State Of The Polls, 2016", "text": "Two years ago, in advance of the 2014 midterms and in conjunction with the release of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings, I wrote an article headlined \u201cIs The Polling Industry In Stasis Or In Crisis?\u201d It pointed out a seeming contradiction: Although there were lots of reasons to be worried about the reliability of polling \u2014 in particular, the ever-declining response rates for telephone surveys \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much evidence of a crisis in the results pollsters were obtaining. Instead, the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles had all featured fairly accurate polling.\n\nHas the reckoning come for the polls since then? The evidence is somewhat mixed. The 2014 midterm elections were not a banner year for pollsters, with most polls showing a statistical bias toward Democrats (reversing their statistical bias toward Republicans in 2012). As a result, there were a handful of major upsets by Republican candidates, along with a few near misses. Still, the error in the polls was reasonably in line with historical norms. It wasn\u2019t the disaster that pollsters have experienced in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Greece, or even in previous U.S. midterm elections, such as 1994 and 1998.\n\nPollster Ratings: We\u2019ve analyzed the historical accuracy of more than 350 polling agencies and rated them according to performance and methodology. See all of our pollster ratings \u00bb\n\nIf the 2014 midterm polls were a little better than reputed, however, the reverse might be true of the 2016 presidential primaries polls. Importantly, the polls (and even more so, the polling averages) had a good track record of calling winners, with the polling front-runner winning the vast majority of the time. Furthermore, the polls caught wind of Donald Trump\u2019s popularity among Republicans early in the cycle, even as a lot of journalists (including, uhh, yours truly) were deeply skeptical about his chances. But the margins were often pretty far off, especially in the Democratic race, with Hillary Clinton often blowing away her polling numbers in the South and Bernie Sanders often doing so elsewhere in the country. Furthermore, although there weren\u2019t many upsets, at least one of them \u2014 Sanders\u2019s win in Michigan \u2014 was historically epic.\n\nDon\u2019t take our word for it, though: We\u2019d encourage you to explore the data for yourself. We\u2019ve just released a new set of pollster ratings, based on data up through and including the Oregon presidential primary May 17. We\u2019ve also published the raw data behind these ratings: more than 7,900 polls conducted in the final three weeks before presidential primaries and caucuses and general elections for president, governor, and the U.S. Senate and House since 1998.\n\nThe methodology we use to calculate the pollster ratings is highly similar to the procedures we followed to generate our 2014 ratings, with a handful of exceptions that I describe in the footnotes.\n\nAs before, the ratings are based both on a pollster\u2019s past accuracy and on two easily measurable methodological standards:\n\nThe first standard is whether the firm participates in the American Association for Public Opinion Research Transparency Initiative, is a member of the National Council on Public Polls or contributes its data to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archive. Polling firms that do one or more of these things generally abide by industry-standard practices for disclosure, transparency and methodology and have historically had more accurate results.\n\nThe second standard is whether the firm usually conducts its polls by placing telephone calls with live interviewers and calls cellphones as well as landlines. Automated polls (\u201crobopolls\u201d), which are legally prohibited from calling cellphones, do not meet this standard even if they use hybrid or mixed-mode methodologies (for example, robocalling landlines and then supplementing with cellphone calls placed by live interviewers). It\u2019s increasingly essential to call cellphones given that about half of American households no longer have a home landline. Although internet polls show promise as a potential alternative, they do not yet have a long enough or consistent enough track record to be placed on the same pedestal as high-quality, live-interview telephone polls, based on our view of the evidence.\n\nBut enough about methodology; let\u2019s return to the question of how the polls fared in the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential primaries.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a calculation we call Simple Average Error. It measures the difference between the percentage of the vote separating the top two finishers in the election and the margin shown by the polls. For instance, if a poll had projected Trump to beat Ted Cruz by 2 percentage points in an election and Trump won by 10 points, that would count as an 8 percentage point error. Likewise, it would count as an 8-point error if Trump had been projected to beat Cruz by 2 points but lost to him by 6 instead.\n\nIn 2014, the average gubernatorial poll had an error of 4.5 percentage points as defined in this way, and the average Senate poll had an error of 5.4 percentage points. The gubernatorial polls were a bit more accurate than usual and the Senate polls a bit less, but both figures are reasonably in line with historical norms. A bigger problem is that most of these polls missed in the same direction, underestimating the Republican candidate. (We\u2019ll take that point up in a moment.)\n\nHouse polls are typically less accurate than Senate or gubernatorial polls \u2014 the further down the ballot you go, the larger the polling error tends to be \u2014 and 2014 was no exception, with the average House poll missing by 7.9 percentage points. That\u2019s not a good result by any stretch of the imagination, although that number is inflated somewhat by a single polling firm, YouGov, which ambitiously released polls of all 435 congressional districts. Most of those polls had small sample sizes of fewer than 200 respondents, and most of them were in noncompetitive districts, which can be difficult to poll. (Our Advanced Plus-Minus and Predictive Plus-Minus calculations adjust for these factors, but Simple Average Error does not.) Excluding YouGov, the average error for House polls was 6.6 percentage points, still a mediocre performance, although similar to past years such as 1998 and 2010.\n\nIf House races can be tricky to poll, presidential primaries are even harder, for some of the reasons I mention here. Turnout is relatively low, people are sometimes choosing among several similar candidates, and voters often wait until the last minute to make their decisions. So primary polling is almost always a fairly wild ride. Still, the average error in primary polls this year was a whopping 9.4 percentage points, worse than the average of 8.1 percentage points in all presidential primaries since 2000. The problems were worse on the Democratic side, with an average error of 10.6 percentage points, compared with 8.3 percentage points in the Republican race.\n\nAnd yet, the primary polls have done a pretty good job of picking winners. In 85 percent of polls this year, the leading candidate in the poll matched the winning candidate in the election. That\u2019s much better than in 2012, when the leading candidate won in the polls only 61 percent of the time.\n\nWhat gives? A lot of primaries and caucuses were lopsided this year, with strongly regional voting patterns; Clinton dominated in the South, and Trump cleaned up in the Northeast, for example. (By contrast, a lot of Republican primaries came down to the wire in 2012.) It\u2019s easier to call the winners right, of course, when an election isn\u2019t competitive. On the other hand, it can be harder for pollsters to nail down the margin in such races. A seemingly noncompetitive race can discourage turnout, either allowing the leading candidate to run up the score or, occasionally, the trailing candidate to do much better than expected because the leading candidate\u2019s voters become complacent. As a technical matter, the handling of undecided voters also matters more in noncompetitive races. In a slight change this year, our Advanced Plus-Minus and Predictive Plus-Minus ratings account for the fact that less-competitive races are associated with a larger error, on average. Still, this doesn\u2019t entirely excuse the polls.\n\nAnother useful measure of polling performance is statistical bias, which indicates whether polls consistently miss in the same direction. If over a large number of races, for example, your polling firm projects Democratic candidates to win by an average of 5 percentage points, and they win by 2 percentage points instead, that means those polls had a pro-Democratic (and anti-Republican) statistical bias of 3 percentage points. Statistical bias isn\u2019t necessarily an indication of partisan bias; some media outlets that are accused of having a pro-Republican bias in their coverage have a pro-Democratic statistical bias in their polls, and vice versa. But it has nevertheless been a problem in recent years:\n\nIn 2012, the polls had a 2 or 3 percentage point pro-Republican bias, meaning that they underrated how well President Obama would do, along with Democratic candidates in gubernatorial and congressional races. In 2014, by contrast, they had roughly a 3 percentage point pro-Democratic bias. So rather than the merely good Republican year implied by the polls, Republicans had a near-landslide in the midterms instead.\n\nThe good news is that, over the long run, the polls haven\u2019t had much of an overall bias, having underrated Republicans in some elections and Democrats in others. But the bias has shifted around somewhat unpredictably from election to election. You should be wary of claims that the polls are bound to be biased in the same direction that they were two years ago or four years ago.\n\nYou should also recognize the potential for statistical bias even (or perhaps especially) if the polls all seem to agree with one another. An uncannily strong consensus among the polls may indicate herding, which means polling firms are suppressing outlier results that appear out of line with the consensus. Good election forecasting models can account for the possibility of herding and statistical bias by assuming that the error in polls is correlated from state to state, but it raises the degree of difficulty in building a model.\n\nWhat about bias in the presidential primary polls? Those numbers aren\u2019t shown in the table above because the bias calculations we list in our pollster ratings pertain only to general elections. But we can calculate them by the same method. Indeed, statistical bias has been a problem in both party primaries this year.\n\nIn Republican primaries and caucuses, the polls generally had a pro-Trump and anti-Cruz bias. In races where Trump and Cruz were the top two finishers in some order, the bias was 5.5 percentage points in Trump\u2019s favor. The bias dissipated as the race went along, and there wasn\u2019t as much of a bias when another candidate \u2014 John Kasich or Marco Rubio \u2014 was Trump\u2019s main competitor in a state. Still, the primary results ought to raise doubts about the theory that a \u201csilent majority\u201d of Trump supporters is being overlooked by the polls. In the primaries, Trump was somewhat overrated by the polls.\n\nIn the Democratic race, the polls had a 1.8 percentage point bias toward Clinton (and against Sanders) overall. However, it varied significantly based on the demographic makeup of the state, with Clinton outperforming her polls in diverse states and Sanders beating his in whiter ones. Specifically, in states where at least 25 percent of the population is black or Hispanic, the polls had a pro-Sanders, anti-Clinton bias of 5.7 percentage points. But they had an 8.2 percentage point bias toward Clinton, and against Sanders, in states where less than 25 percent of the population is black or Hispanic.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the polls mostly identified the right winners, and some of the bias reflected the candidates\u2019 running up the score in demographically favorable terrain. (Clinton, for instance, won South Carolina by 47 percentage points instead of the 27 points projected by the polls.) Still, the results are troubling given that the Sanders and Clinton coalitions each contain hard-to-poll groups. In Clinton\u2019s case, that means black and Hispanic voters, who are usually harder for polls to reach than white voters. For Sanders, that means young and first-time voters, who are also hard to reach and who are sometimes screened out incorrectly by likely voter models. Pollsters should think carefully about their strategies for reaching these groups in the general election.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s take a look at how some of the more prolific pollsters have performed recently. The following table contains our Advanced Plus-Minus scores for polling firms that released at least 20 total polls between the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential primaries. Advanced Plus-Minus measures a poll\u2019s error as compared against others that surveyed the same race, controlling for factors such as the number of days between the poll and the election. Negative scores are good and mean the pollster performed better than other polling firms under similar conditions.\n\nThe best-performing polls recently have been those from Monmouth University and those from Marist College. Both apply \u201cgold standard\u201d methodologies, using live telephone interviews and placing calls to cellphones as well as landlines, and both participate in the AAPOR Transparency Initiative. Quinnipiac University, another \u201cgold standard\u201d pollster, has also performed fairly well of late. So has Fox News, which switched to new polling partners in 2011 and has gotten good results since then.\n\nAutomated polling firms have gotten mediocre results in recent years, especially SurveyUSA and Rasmussen Reports, although note that SurveyUSA has a long history of accurate polling and so retains a high grade overall. Public Policy Polling has gotten fairly good results, by contrast, although that may be because the pollster engages in a high degree of herding.\n\nYouGov, which fared poorly by calculations such as Simple Average Error, gets about an average rating according to Advanced Plus-Minus, which accounts for the fact that they were polling under difficult circumstances (for instance, polling obscure House races that nobody else tried to survey). Still, we\u2019re awaiting more evidence about the reliability of online polls. SurveyMonkey, which has sometimes partnered with FiveThirtyEight, released a set of polls of the Democratic and Republican primaries before Super Tuesday and got mediocre results, but it isn\u2019t really enough data to come to conclusions about long-term accuracy. Other online polling firms, such as Morning Consult and Ipsos, have focused on national polls instead of issuing state polls ahead of key primaries and general elections. In my view, the online pollsters have been too gun-shy as a group (with YouGov an important exception) to issue polls of state and local elections. These firms employ a lot of smart people, and my working assumption is that online polls are already more accurate than automated telephone polls (if not necessarily traditional telephone polls, at least not yet). But that\u2019s nothing more than an educated guess until we get more data on how they perform.\n\nListen to the latest episode of the FiveThirtyEight politics podcast.\n\nParticipation in the AAPOR Transparency Initiative, NCPP or the Roper Center archive continues to be a strong predictor of polling accuracy. Polling firms that get our AAPOR/NCPP/Roper check mark have had an Advanced Plus-Minus score of -0.4 since 2014, compared with a score of +0.8 for those that don\u2019t have it.\n\nAll told, the evidence is ambiguous enough to be consistent with almost any case you\u2019d like to make: either that the polls are about as accurate as they\u2019ve always been, which isn\u2019t to say that they\u2019re perfect, or that there are real warning signs of trouble ahead, which isn\u2019t to say the polls are useless. The answer may also depend on which polls you\u2019re looking at. As we\u2019ve found in the past, polls that employ more expensive methodologies, and abide by higher levels of disclosure and transparency, tend to be more accurate than those that don\u2019t.

In places with more sick people, more people over 65 and fewer hospital beds per person, the health care system could easily be swamped, leaving residents who need hospitalization in even greater danger.\n\nTo find the areas at the greatest risk of being overwhelmed by a COVID-19 outbreak, we analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a collection of surveys that ask U.S. residents about their health, which allowed us to estimate what percentage of residents in a region were at risk due to their age or underlying health conditions. We then used Kaiser Health News\u2019s data on the number of hospitals and intensive care unit beds in each U.S. county to find the ratio of at-risk residents to beds.\n\nBy that measure, one of the most vulnerable regions for which we have data is the Hilton Head Island metropolitan area, where about 63 percent of adults are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and there are approximately 3,900 high-risk individuals for every ICU bed.\n\nWhile the percentage of Hilton Head residents who are at risk is on the higher end of our data set, it\u2019s still notably lower than the 70 to 80 percent we saw in several other areas we analyzed. But those regions had more health care facilities to serve those at-risk residents, while the Hilton Head area has only three hospitals and 28 ICU beds.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight\n\nTake Hardeeville, for example. It\u2019s a small city in the Hilton Head metropolitan area, and in many ways it\u2019s like any other rural area. Under normal circumstances, the city\u2019s residents would be looking forward to an Easter egg hunt, golf and pickleball tournaments, proms and graduations. But the people of Hardeeville are particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus. In the last decade, the city has seen a population boom, and many of those new residents are retirees, according to Hardeeville Mayor Harry Williams. The city\u2019s large older population \u2014 the percentage of residents who\u2019ve hit retirement age is nearly twice as high as the national share of people over 65 \u2014 may be cause for concern, as Jasper County, where Hardeeville is located, has only one hospital and four ICU beds.\n\nWhile regular hospital beds can be converted to serve critically ill patients, it\u2019s not easy to do because ICU beds require more equipment and specialized room layouts. Despite the difficulties, Coastal Carolina Hospital, the only hospital in Jasper County, has added beds for seriously ill patients by turning its observation unit into an ICU patient treatment area, according to hospital CEO Joel Taylor. Other hospitals are adding beds in temporary spaces like tents and trailers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just a lack of beds that can strain the health care system, noted David Wallace, a critical care doctor and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Shortages of space, staff, medications and other vital resources are also a concern, and health systems in rural and poorer areas will be stretched the thinnest.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be parts of the country that don\u2019t even have the staffing even if you were able to ramp up your available resources, in terms of places to put these patients,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIf we were able to create more ICU beds and more ventilators and more [personal protective equipment], who\u2019s going to be staffing those areas?\u201d\n\nCoastal Carolina Hospital is cataloguing what skills workers already have and cross-training them to work in parts of the hospital outside their normal assignments. This gives the hospital more flexibility in staffing, allowing it to do more with a limited number of employees by switching people to cover areas facing staffing shortfalls.\n\nHardeeville\u2019s mayor is also worried about how easy it would be for the area to run out of other types of vital workers, like first responders. \u201cBeing in a rural area, we have a good staff, but it\u2019s not a staff that can afford to have a whole shift wiped out because one person got sick and passed it onto the entire shift,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big concern of ours because we don\u2019t have replacement numbers if our first responders get sick.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the city got a shipment of additional masks and other protective gear for its first responders a few weeks ago, just as supplies were running low. So far, the city hasn\u2019t run out, but it also doesn\u2019t have a stockpile that would last through a big surge of cases.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there have only been 15 COVID-19 cases and one death in Jasper County, according to South Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Environmental Control. COVID-19 data should always be taken with a grain of salt, though, since tests have been so hard to come by. The closest testing site to Hardeeville is a hospital in a neighboring county, about 35 minutes away. Coastal Carolina is working on being able to test patients on site, Taylor said.\n\nThe state is encouraging residents to practice social distancing. But of course, staying at home is easier for some people than others. Williams said that in the gated communities where older residents often live, \u201cAmazon is a way of life,\u201d but that\u2019s not the case for working families.\n\n\u201cDelivery services are not as effective as, let\u2019s say, New York City,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor the working families that have to go to the grocery stores, go to Walmart for their everyday needs, those people need to go out. Those stores are open and they are taking precautions. The governor has limited the amount of people allowed in them, based on their square footage.\u201d\n\nBut even those who have to go out are doing their best to keep infection rates down, Williams said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s pitching in.\u201d\n\nBut more people may start leaving their homes soon. Shutting down businesses is having devastating effects on the economy, and the Hilton Head area is a popular vacation destination, so losing that influx of tourism dollars is an especially big blow for places like Hardeeville. South Carolina\u2019s governor announced Monday to allow public beaches and some retail stores to reopen. But experts say relaxing social distancing measures too soon and before testing is widely available might result in another influx of cases, overwhelming the health care system and leading to even more deaths.\n\nFind the full data set on GitHub to see if your area is included and how it compares with other areas.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-one-high-risk-community-in-rural-south-carolina-is-bracing-for-covid-19/", "author": ["Likhitha Butchireddygari"]}, {"title": "How Urban Or Rural Is Your State? And What Does That Mean For The 2020 Election?", "text": "How Urban Or Rural Is Your State? And What Does That Mean For The 2020 Election?\n\nThe 2016 election may not have been a realignment by historical standards, but it did bring the country\u2019s political divides more in line with its cultural divides \u2014 the biggest of which may be the growing chasm between urban and rural Americans.\n\nEssentially, it boils down to this: Cities and (especially these days) suburbs vote Democratic, and rural areas vote Republican. Some research suggests that these patterns hold up even after accounting for other important political predictors like race or gender. And there\u2019s evidence that the urban-rural divide has continued to increase since 2016. For example, San Diego has historically voted Republican, but the GOP was shut out of the 2020 mayoral election after two Democrats won the most votes in the city\u2019s March jungle primary. At the same time, Republicans widened their margins in rural areas even amid their defeat in the 2018 midterms, and parts of Appalachia that had voted Democratic for generations now vote Republican up and down the ballot, completing their conversion to the GOP under President Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, however, to measure just how urban or rural a place is (although CityLab\u2019s Congressional Density Index and The New York Times Upshot\u2019s \u201cneighborhood density\u201d are good starts). So FiveThirtyEight came up with one of its own, which has already played a role in our 2020 primary forecast\u2019s \u201cfundamentals\u201d calculations. Essentially, we calculated the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of every census tract and took the natural logarithm to create an \u201curbanization index,\u201d or a calculation of how urban or rural a given area is. And this number can be calculated (via a weighted average based on each census tract\u2019s population) for states, congressional districts, counties \u2014 or anything that is made up of census tracts. Here is a calculation for how urban or rural each of the 50 states is:\n\nHow urban or rural is your state?

Note that FiveThirtyEight\u2019s current partisan leans do not yet incorporate the results of the 2018 election. FiveThirtyEight\u2019s urbanization index is calculated as the natural logarithm of the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of a given resident. Source: American Community Survey\n\nYou may have noticed a pattern in the table above. The states with the highest urbanization indices include a lot of blue states, like New York, New Jersey and California. Meanwhile, the rural end of the spectrum is populated with red states like Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota. Indeed, if we directly compare this metric with the results of the 2016 presidential election, we can quantify just how important the urban-rural divide has become in our politics.\n\nAs you can see in the chart below, 10 of the 13 most urban states voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, while 12 of the 14 most rural states voted for Trump. The exceptions: the fairly urbanized states of Florida, Arizona and Texas, which went for Trump, and the more rural states of Vermont and Maine, which cast their ballots for Clinton.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, too, that this relationship between a state\u2019s \u201curbanness\u201d and its presidential vote will get even stronger in 2020, as the correlation got noticeably tighter from 2012 to 2016 (the correlation coefficient was 0.55 in 2012 and 0.69 in 2016).\n\nSo let\u2019s indulge in a little hypothetical and take this possibility to the extreme. What if the 2020 presidential vote were based purely on our urbanization index? According to our calculations, Democrats would win such a presidential election handily \u2014 323 electoral votes to 215. And the election would produce a pretty funky-looking Electoral College map \u2014 one that looks simultaneously impossible and yet also like the logical conclusion of the way our politics has been trending. Here\u2019s what the margin of victory would look like in each state:\n\nWhat if the urban-rural divide dictated the 2020 election? The results of a hypothetical presidential election if a state\u2019s urbanization were the only factor, based on the relationship between FiveThirtyEight\u2019s urbanization index and 2016 presidential election results State Result State Result Alabama R+16.0 Montana R+30.8 Alaska R+27.3 Nebraska R+8.2 Arizona D+6.1 Nevada D+12.3 Arkansas R+20.5 New Hampshire R+11.9 California D+17.7 New Jersey D+18.3 Colorado D+4.2 New Mexico R+12.2 Connecticut D+7.6 New York D+22.5 Delaware D+2.3 North Carolina R+6.6 Florida D+8.3 North Dakota R+23.2 Georgia R+3.6 Ohio D+0.6 Hawaii D+3.3 Oklahoma R+11.6 Idaho R+16.1 Oregon R+1.5 Illinois D+10.3 Pennsylvania D+4.1 Indiana R+5.5 Rhode Island D+11.6 Iowa R+16.1 South Carolina R+9.4 Kansas R+9.3 South Dakota R+27.4 Kentucky R+13.6 Tennessee R+8.3 Louisiana R+8.6 Texas D+4.5 Maine R+23.4 Utah D+1.7 Maryland D+11.5 Vermont R+25.9 Massachusetts D+13.2 Virginia D+1.0 Michigan R+0.3 Washington D+3.8 Minnesota R+4.9 West Virginia R+22.4 Mississippi R+25.1 Wisconsin R+8.3 Missouri R+8.2 Wyoming R+33.6 Source: American Community Survey\n\nYes, some of the results are fantasies. Utah, despite being a bit more urban than your average state, is not going to vote Democratic any time soon. And if Vermont votes Republican by nearly 26 points, please pinch me.\n\nBut other results look more plausible, even if they are maybe a few election cycles away from this reality. In this scenario, the Midwest continues its embrace of the GOP, enough to make Minnesota a red state and Wisconsin go Republican by more than 8 points. Thanks to Chicago, Illinois would be the only Democratic bastion left in the region; Michigan and Ohio, though, would remain swing states.\n\nDemocrats, however, would more than make up for losses in the Midwest with wins in the Sun Belt. Florida, Arizona and Texas would become light blue states in this hypothetical. And given that these three states were decided by single digits in 2016, it\u2019s actually not that far-fetched that they could vote Democratic in 2020 in real life. That said, two other emerging Democratic targets, Georgia and North Carolina, remain red states in a world where elections break down exactly along urban-rural lines.\n\nBear in mind that this exercise was, as they say, for entertainment purposes only. The urban-rural divide will never explain everything about our politics; indeed, analysis that places too much weight on it misses the fact that many African Americans in rural areas vote Democratic, or that many Cuban Americans in urban areas like Miami vote Republican. But it does help to illustrate why so many Democrats believe the path forward for their party is through the Sun Belt.\n\nAnd indeed, early polls suggest former Vice President Joe Biden is competitive with Trump in Florida, Arizona and, to a lesser extent, Texas. In a simple average of eight Florida polls conducted since Jan. 1, Biden leads Trump 48 percent to 46 percent. And in a simple average of eight Arizona polls so far this year, Biden leads Trump 47 percent to 45 percent. But Biden still trails Trump, 48 percent to 44 percent, in a simple average of this year\u2019s Texas polls. Still, that would be remarkably close for a state that Mitt Romney carried by nearly 16 points in 2012.\n\nObviously, these numbers can change; general-election polls have yet to come into their full predictive value. But if Biden does carry one or more of these states, he could have their high rate of urbanization to thank.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Our 2020 Election Priors", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107 And The Mavs Are Pushing The Limits Of Offensive Efficiency", "text": "A few weeks ago, Chris Herring wrote about just how historically dominant the 2019-20 Milwaukee Bucks have been on defense, a fact that has gone somewhat unnoticed as Giannis Antetokounmpo and his sharpshooting friends have cruised through the league this year.

Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nAny way you measure it, this Mavs attack is scoring at one of the most efficient rates ever. And a lot of the credit has rightly gone to second-year guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107, who is on the short list of this year\u2019s MVP candidates after winning Rookie of the Year honors last season. Among players with at least 895 minutes played this season, Don\u010di\u0107 ranks third on offense (behind only James Harden and Damian Lillard) in our RAPTOR metric with a rating of +7.7 \u2014 meaning we estimate that his offense has been worth a shade under 8 more points than an average player for every 100 possessions his team plays.\n\nIs that a lot? Why yes, it is. Historically speaking, there have been only 31 individual seasons (including those from Harden and Lillard) since the 1976 ABA merger in which a player logged at least 1,500 minutes and had an offensive RAPTOR better than Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s has been this year. And Don\u010di\u0107 is easily the youngest player in the sample to produce this kind of offensive season, in his age-20 season (as of Feb. 1). Nobody on the list above him did it at age 21; Chris Paul was the youngest, at age 22 back in 2007-08.\n\nAlthough Don\u010di\u0107 still has room to improve as a long-range shooter \u2014 his 3-point accuracy of 31.5 percent ranks 140th out of 147 qualified players this season \u2014 the rest of his offensive statistics have been stellar. Don\u010di\u0107 excels at creating chances for others; he\u2019s assisted on 45.6 percent of teammate baskets while in the game. He\u2019s also great at creating for himself: He has a true shooting percentage of 58.3 percent with a usage rate of 37.0 percent, numbers that are particularly impressive when you realize that only 18.2 percent of his buckets have been assisted by a teammate (the fourth-lowest rate in the league). With his tremendous ability to get to the rim, absorb contact and finish the play, Don\u010di\u0107 is generating 115.9 points per 100 possessions while also personally finishing 38.4 percent of the Mavs\u2019 possessions that he\u2019s on the court for \u2014 numbers that are in rarified territory on the usage-vs.-efficiency skill curve.\n\nSo with Don\u010di\u0107 playing 54.9 percent of Dallas\u2019s available minutes at a +7.7 RAPTOR offensive clip, we would expect a totally average team that added him to instantly outscore a typical offense by 3.4 points per 100 possessions. But as we mentioned before, the Mavericks as a team have actually been 6.4 points per 100 better than average \u2014 meaning Dallas\u2019s standout offensive season has been about more than just Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s individual excellence.\n\nAccording to Basketball-Reference.com, seven members of the 2019-20 Mavericks have played at least one-third of the team\u2019s available minutes and generated at least 115 points per 100 possessions: Don\u010di\u0107 (115.9), Dorian Finney-Smith (121.6), Tim Hardaway Jr. (116.4), Maxi Kleber (123.4), Seth Curry (124.4), Delon Wright (121.2) and Dwight Powell (133.8). (Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is is notably absent from the list; his individual offensive rating of 109.6 is the lowest of Dallas\u2019s regulars, though he is second on the team in usage rate among those playing at least a third of available minutes.) Going back to 1976, no team in modern history has ever finished a season with this many players logging such regular minutes at such high levels of efficiency.\n\nThe Mavs are overflowing with efficient players NBA teams with the most players who played at least one-third of available team minutes and had an individual offensive efficiency of at least 115 points per 100 possessions, 1976-2020 Team Year No. of Players List DAL 2020 7 Fin.-Smith, Hardaway, Don\u010di\u0107, Kleber, Curry, Wright, Powell DEN 2019 6 Joki\u0107, Morris, Millsap, Beasley, Plumlee, Hernang\u00f3mez PHO 1995 6 Majerle, Green, Barkley, Person, Ainge, Johnson CHI 1996 5 Jordan, Pippen, Kukoc, Kerr, Harper CHI 1997 5 Jordan, Pippen, Kerr, Harper, Kukoc HOU 2017 5 Harden, Anderson, Beverley, Capela, Dekker HOU 2020 5 Harden, Tucker, House, McLemore, Capela LAC 2020 5 Harrell, Leonard, Shamet, Beverley, Zubac LAL 1987 5 Johnson, Worthy, Scott, Cooper, Green LAL 1989 5 Worthy, Johnson, Green, Thompson, Cooper LAL 2020 5 James, Davis, Caldwell-Pope, Howard, McGee MIA 2020 5 Adebayo, Robinson, Butler, Jones, Olynyk OKC 2013 5 Durant, Ibaka, Sefolosha, Martin, Collison OKC 2016 5 Westbrook, Durant, Adams, Kanter, Roberson ORL 1995 5 O\u2019Neal, Hardaway, Grant, Anderson, Scott PHO 1993 5 Majerle, Barkley, Ainge, Johnson, Ceballos PHO 2009 5 Nash, O\u2019Neal, Stoudemire, Richardson, Barbosa PHO 2010 5 Stoudemire, Nash, Richardson, Frye, Dudley POR 2009 5 Roy, Blake, Fernandez, Przybilla, Batum TOR 2018 5 Lowry, Valanciunas, Poeltl, VanVleet, Wright UTA 1998 5 Malone, Hornacek, Russell, Keefe, Stockton Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nTo be sure, Don\u010di\u0107 has opened up many opportunities for his teammates to be efficient. According to Second Spectrum, there\u2019s been a potential assist on 57.3 percent of Dallas\u2019s non-Don\u010di\u0107 shots; for context, the Phoenix Suns are the team with the NBA\u2019s highest rate of potential assists per shot this season, at 57.0 percent. But his teammates still needed to convert on those chances, and they\u2019ve been doing an excellent job of it. Dallas has both seven regulars with a 3-point percentage over 35 percent and seven regulars with a 2-point field-goal percentage over 50 percent. Basically, the Mavericks almost never feature an inefficient offensive option on the floor at any given moment during a game.\n\nOf course, the abundance of 2019-20 teams on the list above shows just how much this efficiency-maximizing mentality has swept across the league, beyond just Luka and the Mavs. In the modern NBA, great offensive teams work like sophisticated machines, where all of the component pieces amplify each other\u2019s strengths. There\u2019s no place for a broken part in that apparatus, so coaches either have to find ways to help a player succeed or slot in a new player who won\u2019t be a liability. It\u2019s a testament to both Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s playmaking and the coaching of Rick Carlisle that Dallas has emerged with so many players performing so well in their roles.\n\nPerhaps an interesting comparison can be found in Dallas\u2019s previous generation of offensive juggernauts. The 2003-04 Mavs remain the greatest offensive team \u2014 relative to league average \u2014 in NBA history (see above), and they did it with four regulars who had an offensive rating over 115 points per 100: Dirk Nowitzki, Michael Finley, Steve Nash and Antawn Jamison. Nash and Nowitzki are particularly known as two of the greatest offensive forces to ever hit the hardwood, capable in their primes of lifting any offense to the top of the league, so it makes sense that they would combine to drive a historic offense. But that team also had a highly inefficient player right in the middle of it: Antoine Walker, who played nearly 72 percent of team minutes and used over 22 percent of possessions while on the court but generated just 100.7 points per 100 possessions.\n\nThough those Mavs were able to integrate him into their scheme and still score at an incredible rate, it\u2019s telling that there are hardly any Walkers to be found in today\u2019s best offenses. Instead, they are built more like the current Mavericks \u2014 a bunch of players who score at a hyper-efficient rate, all orbiting around one central Don\u010di\u0107-like figure who can do everything.\n\nCheck out our latest NBA predictions.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/luka-doncic-and-the-mavs-are-pushing-the-limits-of-offensive-efficiency/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "The Democratic Presidential Candidates Are Becoming Less Popular", "text": "Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nPoll(s) of the week\n\nBeing well-liked matters for presidential candidates: Generally speaking, they need to be at least somewhat popular to win.\n\nTo that effect, Monmouth University and Quinnipiac University each released a poll this week that asked voters whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of leading Democratic presidential candidates and President Trump, but what each pollster found was pretty different.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll found that Trump received the worst marks overall \u2014 a net favorability rating (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) of -17. This figure is 10 percentage points below the lowest-rated Democratic contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and 14 points worse than former Vice President Joe Biden, whose net favorability rating was -3. The Monmouth poll, on the other hand, put Trump\u2019s net favorability at -6, which made him more popular than any of the Democratic front-runners, with the exception of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg was actually the most well-liked candidate in both polls, but his standing is more in flux considering far fewer respondents knew enough about him to have an opinion, compared with those who said the same about Trump, Biden, Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Democratic primary, according to the early states\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? We know that many of 2020 front-runners aren\u2019t as popular as previous presidential contenders (at least at this point in the cycle), but among the general electorate, is Trump really as popular as many of the leading Democratic presidential contenders? To answer this question, we looked at all the national polls we could find since January (over 150 of them) that asked about how well-liked Trump and these candidates are. And as you can see in the chart below, despite one or two recent good polls for Trump, Trump remains really unpopular \u2014 far more than any of the leading Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nBut Democrats\u2019 net favorability ratings have taken a hit. As you can see in the chart above, even though Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg are nowhere near as unpopular as Trump, their net favorability ratings have trended downward recently. This isn\u2019t totally surprising, though, as my colleague Geoffrey Skelley noted a few weeks ago: Many presidential candidates\u2019 net favorability ratings have been negative or close to zero since at least 2008, a sign, perhaps, of the polarized times we live in.\n\nOf course, there is still time for public perception to change (in either direction) between now and November. But if the polls are any indication, opinions of the Democratic candidates seem much more likely to shift than opinions of Trump. That might be because people\u2019s opinions of the Democratic candidates aren\u2019t nearly as entrenched. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, told me that if you look at the breakdown of \u201csomewhat\u201d and \u201cvery\u201d favorable opinions for Trump and the Democratic candidates, \u201copinion about Trump is significantly more deeply held than opinion about any of the Democratic candidates right now.\u201d The same is true if you look at the breakdown of \u201csomewhat\u201d and \u201cvery\u201d unfavorable opinions for Trump and the Democratic candidates \u2014 Trump is much more actively disliked.\n\nOpinions are pretty set on Trump, but more flexible on Dems Share of respondents who said they had a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable or unfavorable opinion of President Trump and the four Democratic front-runners, according to an average of polls from Oct. 11 to Dec 11, 2019 Favorable Unfavorable Candidate Very Somewhat Difference Very Somewhat Difference Donald Trump 30.3 11.5 +18.8 47.8 9.5 +38.2 Joe Biden 19.4 24.9 -5.4 31.8 15.4 16.4 Bernie Sanders 20.7 23.1 -2.4 34.6 13.4 21.3 Elizabeth Warren 21.1 20.7 0.4 34.4 10.5 23.9 Pete Buttigieg 14.1 20.3 -6.2 23.3 12.4 10.9 Source: Polls\n\nSo though Trump may be less popular than his prospective Democratic opponents overall, he has a pretty high level of enthusiastic support \u2014 32 percent of respondents said they had a \u201cvery\u201d favorable opinion of him in an average of the last two months of polls. No Democratic contender has earned marks as high.\n\nThis isn\u2019t all that surprising considering Democrats still haven\u2019t settled on their nominee. Once they pick someone to take on Trump, this could all change, too, and the eventual Democratic nominee could end up even more unpopular than Trump \u2014 or maybe with an even more loyal fan base. We can\u2019t know at this point, but it does seem as if there is more opportunity for Democratic candidates to move public opinion \u2014 in either direction \u2014 than there is for Trump.\n\nOther polling bites\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of favorability ratings, the Monmouth and Quinnipiac polls mentioned above also had net favorability ratings for former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the most recent Democratic contender to enter the 2020 race. Unfortunately for Bloomberg, the results weren\u2019t very good. The Monmouth poll put his net approval among registered voters at -28 and the Quinnipiac poll at -19, making these the lowest marks that any one candidate received in both polls, including Trump. Ouch!\n\nHouse Democrats and the Trump administration reached a deal on Tuesday to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that updates the current North American Free Trade Agreement. According to a YouGov/Economist poll, 43 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the deal, 17 percent have an unfavorable view and 40 percent are not sure. The Senate is expected to vote on the deal in 2020.\n\n56 percent of Mexicans say the U.S. poses the greatest threat to their country in the future, while 27 percent cite the U.S. as Mexico\u2019s most dependable ally (around 5 percent said both concurrently), according to a poll by the Pew Research Center.\n\nThree in four Americans plan to have a Christmas tree in their home this year, according to a poll conducted by YouGov, but only 15 percent say they will buy a real tree. Thirty-eight percent plan to use an artificial tree they already own, while 11 percent plan to buy an artificial tree.\n\nMorning Consult collected surveys of nearly 375,000 adults and found that Fox News is the most-watched cable news outlet in the U.S. in more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s congressional districts (respondents were asked whether they watched CNN, Fox News or MSNBC). On average, 33 percent of adults say they watch the network at least once a week, followed by 28 percent who say they watch CNN and 20 percent who watch MSNBC.\n\nFairVote partnered with YouGov to release a poll of the South Carolina Democratic primary that simulates the primary under a ranked-choice voting system. The way it works is that voters rank the candidates by preference (with the ability to rank up to 10 of the 18 candidates or just the five candidates with the highest polling averages). The candidate with the fewest votes is then eliminated and his or her votes redistributed to each voters\u2019 next choice. This process is repeated until one candidate (the winner) is left. In case of this simulation, Biden both started out in the lead and gained even more ground as candidates dropped out.\n\nchoice. This process is repeated until one candidate (the winner) is left.

According to Politico\u2019s polling tracker, Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 leads the field with about 29 percent of the vote, but needs a majority (51 percent) to win. If that doesn\u2019t happen, the election will go to a runoff in January.\n\nTrump approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 41.9 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -11.3 points). At this time last week, 41.8 percent approved and 53.3 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -11.5 points).

We started with Elo ratings before introducing our CARMELO player projection system, which we then incorporated into our \u201cCARM-Elo\u201d season prediction model. We tested and tweaked the prediction model over the years, but it was always powered by metrics from other sources, such as Box Plus/Minus (BPM) and Real Plus-Minus (RPM).\n\nBut that changes this year. RAPTOR, which stands for Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings, is FiveThirtyEight\u2019s new NBA statistic. We\u2019re pretty excited about it. In addition to being a statistic that we bake in house, RAPTOR fulfills two long-standing goals of ours:\n\nFirst, we wanted to create a publicly available statistic that takes advantage of modern NBA data, specifically player tracking and play-by-play data that isn\u2019t available in traditional box scores.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, we wanted a statistic that better reflects how modern NBA teams actually evaluate players.\n\nNBA teams highly value floor spacing, defense and shot creation, and they place relatively little value on traditional big-man skills. RAPTOR likewise values these things \u2014 not because we made any deliberate attempt to design the system that way but because the importance of those skills emerges naturally from the data. RAPTOR thinks ball-dominant players such as James Harden and Steph Curry are phenomenally good. It highly values two-way wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It can have a love-hate relationship with centers, who are sometimes overvalued in other statistical systems. But it appreciates modern centers such as Nikola Joki\u0107 and Joel Embiid, as well as defensive stalwarts like Rudy Gobert.\n\nOur sports podcast, Hot Takedown, discusses RAPTOR\n\nThis article will go over some of the highlights of how RAPTOR works. For a much deeper and more technical description, you can find our methodological explainer here. But these are the highlights:\n\nLike BPM and RPM, RAPTOR is a plus-minus statistic that measures the number of points a player contributes to his team\u2019s offense and defense per 100 possessions, relative to a league-average player. For instance, a player with an offensive RAPTOR rating of +2.1 boosts his team\u2019s performance by 2.1 points per 100 offensive possessions while he is on the floor. Likewise, a player with a defensive RAPTOR of +3.4 would improve his team\u2019s defensive performance by 3.4 points per 100 possessions while he\u2019s on the court.\n\nPlus-minus statistics have certain inherent limitations, and RAPTOR is subject to those, too. Namely, these statistics assume that player performance is largely linear and additive, that is, that you can roughly add up the ratings from individual players to project team performance. In other words, RAPTOR does not account for coaching, systems or synergies between teammates.\n\nRAPTOR consists of two major components that are blended together to rate players: a \u201cbox\u201d (as in \u201cbox score\u201d) component, which uses individual statistics (including statistics derived from player tracking and play-by-play data), and an \u201con-off\u201d component, which evaluates a team\u2019s performance when the player and various combinations of his teammates are on or off the floor.\n\nThe variables included in \u201cbox\u201d RAPTOR were chosen by evaluating how they did in predicting long-term RAPM (real adjusted plus-minus), which is a measure of how a team\u2019s performance changes when the player is on and off the floor. Essentially, this is the same technique that BPM used, only RAPTOR uses play-by-play and player tracking statistics in addition to traditional ones. On offense, for instance, in addition to using traditional statistics like points, RAPTOR accounts for factors such as how many of a player\u2019s field goals were assisted and how valuable these assists were, the value of different types of offensive rebounds, time of possession and various measures of floor spacing, such as the number of contested 3-pointers that the player took. On defense, it looks at factors like how often the player was the nearest defender on an opponents\u2019 shot and how often those shots went in, how many points and rebounds were scored by opponents at the defender\u2019s position, and how often the player induced offensive fouls.\n\nThe \u201con-off\u201d element of RAPTOR evaluates how a player\u2019s team performed while he was on the floor, how the player\u2019s courtmates (the teammates that the player most often shared the court with) performed while they were on the floor without the player, and, finally, how those courtmates\u2019 other courtmates performed when they were on the floor without the player\u2019s courtmates, all adjusted for the strength of competition they were facing. We know it might sound a little goofy. But it\u2019s relatively simple to calculate. And it correlates very well with RAPM, while stabilizing a lot faster than RAPM, which can take years\u2019 worth of data to estimate reliably.\n\nthe player, and, finally, how those courtmates\u2019 other courtmates performed when they were on the floor without the player\u2019s courtmates, all adjusted for the strength of competition they were facing. We know it might sound a little goofy. But it\u2019s relatively simple to calculate. And it correlates very well with RAPM, while stabilizing a lot faster than RAPM, which can take years\u2019 worth of data to estimate reliably. Overall, however, RAPTOR weights the \u201cbox\u201d component more highly than the \u201con-off\u201d component. In testing RAPTOR on out-of-sample data, we found that while on-court/off-court stats provide useful information, they\u2019re nonetheless quite noisy as compared with individual measures of player value that are used in the \u201cbox\u201d part of RAPTOR.\n\nWhen applied to past data \u2014 for instance, in evaluating who the best players were in the 2018-19 season \u2014 RAPTOR is a descriptive statistic. Descriptive RAPTOR is based solely on a player\u2019s on-court performance and the performance of the player\u2019s teammates, as described above. It does not use priors based on a player\u2019s height, weight, age or any other factor.\n\nstatistic.

It does not use priors based on a player\u2019s height, weight, age or any other factor. However, RAPTOR can also be used to make team and player predictions, and indeed our NBA predictions are now fueled by RAPTOR. (We are retiring the CARMELO brand name from our previous projection system, although much of the code for RAPTOR projections is borrowed from CARMELO.) RAPTOR-driven predictions do use qualities such as height, age and draft position, and even whether a player recently appeared on an All-NBA team \u2014 that data improves the performance of the predictive measure. Predictions also weight variables slightly differently than descriptive RAPTOR does, as certain statistics are more subject to luck than others. We refer to this predictive version of RAPTOR as PREDATOR (PREDictive rApTOR).\n\nRAPTOR is based exclusively on publicly available data. There are other player-tracking statistics we believe could be highly helpful to RAPTOR, especially more detailed measures of on-ball defense, so we hope to be able to revisit RAPTOR as additional data becomes available.\n\nRAPTOR\u2019s name (in addition to being a whimsical backronym in the tradition of CARMELO and DRAYMOND) honors the 2018-19 Toronto Raptors, which FiveThirtyEight\u2019s previous projection system correctly predicted had an edge over the Golden State Warriors (even though we didn\u2019t fully believe the projection ourselves at the time).\n\nThe full-fledged version of RAPTOR is available for the 2013-14 season onward, as that\u2019s when the NBA\u2019s player-tracking data came on line. We also have a historical version of RAPTOR called Approximate RAPTOR dating back to 1976-1977, the first season after the ABA-NBA merger, but that uses a far more limited range of data.\n\nRAPTOR ratings for players with at least 1,000 minutes played in a season since 2013-14 can be found in the table below. As you can see, RAPTOR generally loves perimeter players and wings, such as Curry, Harden, Leonard and Chris Paul, although some frontcourt players like Jokic, Anthony Davis and Draymond Green are also rated highly by the system. For more detail on past RAPTORs, including the breakdown of box and on-off components, you can download files that list the regular season and playoffs separately, or a version that combines a

The ball hit a 2-year-old girl, who was rushed out of the stadium. The game stopped as an emotional Almora dropped to a knee. Less than two weeks later, as the Washington Nationals played the White Sox in Chicago, a woman sitting just past the third-base dugout was struck in the face. Less than two weeks after that, a Dodger Stadium spectator sitting just past the netting on the first-base line was hit in the head by a hard line drive off the bat of right fielder Cody Bellinger.\n\nBloomberg News estimated in 2014 that 1,750 fans per year are hurt by batted balls at MLB games. Amid debates over how much protection teams should offer spectators, we wanted to find out which areas of stadiums might be the most dangerous, which could help us figure out what could be done to prevent more fan injuries.\n\nBecause there\u2019s no central database of all of MLB\u2019s foul balls, we had to compile a data set ourselves. To do that, we searched the batted-ball data for this season on Baseball Savant to find the 10 stadiums that produced the most foul balls up to June 5 and then analyzed the pitch-level data from the most foul-heavy game day at each of those stadiums (including one doubleheader). Because we had to individually research each foul ball, we couldn\u2019t look at a whole season\u2019s worth of fouls. By limiting the data set to the most foul-heavy days of play in those 10 stadiums, we aimed to keep the data set to a manageable size while also capturing the largest number of fouls we could from a variety of parks, since stadiums vary dramatically in architecture, altitude and seating arrangements.\n\nDozens of fouls per game in the most foul-heavy parks The most foul-heavy day at each of the 10 stadiums that produced the most fouls this season, as of June 5 Most foul-heavy day Stadium Average No. of Fouls per game Date Matchup No. of Fouls Camden Yards* 57 4/20/19 Baltimore Orioles vs. Minnesota Twins 113 PNC Park 57 6/1/19 Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Milwaukee Brewers 111 Oakland Coliseum 53 6/2/19 Oakland A\u2019s vs. Houston Astros 109 T-Mobile Park 53 5/18/19 Seattle Mariners vs. Minnesota Twins 100 Globe Life Park 55 5/3/19 Texas Rangers vs. Toronto Blue Jays 87 Dodger Stadium 51 3/29/19 Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Arizona Diamondsbacks 86 Miller Park 55 5/4/19 Milwaukee Brewers vs. New York Mets 85 Citizens Bank Park 53 4/27/19 Philadelphia Phillies vs. Miami Marlins 75 SunTrust Park 53 4/14/19 Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets 73 Yankee Stadium 51 3/31/19 New York Yankees vs. Baltimore Orioles 67 * Includes both games of the doubleheader Source: Baseball Savant\n\nWe watched clips of 906 foul balls hit during those games (excluding foul tips, which were never in danger of reaching the stands, and fouls that resulted in outs, because Baseball Savant groups those with other types of caught-ball outs, so we couldn\u2019t get data on foul outs specifically), and we recorded whether the fouls were grounders, fly balls, line drives or pop-ups. Then we split the parks into \u201czones\u201d to categorize the general area where each of those balls landed.\n\nZones 1, 2 and 3 include seats that are largely protected by netting \u2014 the area behind home plate and both dugouts \u2014 along with the corresponding areas of foul territory on the field. Zones 4 and 5 are mostly non-netted seating areas and the foul territory outside the baselines, from the dugout to the foul pole. Zones 6 and 7 cover the areas past the foul poles; the fly balls that land here typically have too much arc to be dangerous, and line drives rarely make it that far.\n\nLess than half of the foul balls we charted were followed by a camera to where they landed. But by gauging angles, we estimated where all of the fouls \u2014 both those that were followed by a camera and those that weren\u2019t \u2014 likely landed. We tested our predictions against the footage of the balls that were followed to check our accuracy.\n\nNearly equal shares of foul balls ended up in zones with netting vs. zones that largely lack netting: 454 balls landed in zones 1, 2 and 3, while 452 balls fell in zones 4 through 7.\n\nThe scariest foul balls are those with high exit velocities, particularly the line drives, which give spectators only seconds \u2014 or fractions of a second \u2014 to react. Statcast was able to measure exit velocities for 580 of the 906 foul balls in our data set, and most of the hardest-hit of those 580 landed in areas that are primarily unprotected. Of the fly balls with recorded exit velocities of 90 mph or higher, 71.8 percent landed in zones 4 and 5. And all of the line drives that left the bat at 90 mph or more landed in those same zones. That\u2019s the type of hit that injured the toddler at this year\u2019s Cubs-Astros game or that blinded a man in one eye at Wrigley Field in 2017.\n\nMajor league stadiums have slowly been installing more netting around the field. Players have been pushing the issue, including Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill, who called the MLB Players Association to voice his support for more protective netting. In 2015, MLB encouraged teams to extend netting to the \u201cnear ends of both dugouts.\u201d By 2018, all 30 stadiums had exceeded that recommendation, installing netting from one end of the dugout to the other. After the incident at Guaranteed Rate Field, the White Sox announced that they would implement netting from foul pole to foul pole, and crews worked during the All-Star break to install the new nets. The Washington Nationals also used the break to add netting.\n\nBut more netting won\u2019t protect every fan. Linda Goldbloom was sitting high above home plate in Dodger Stadium \u2014 in zone 1, where netting is provided \u2014 last year when she was struck and killed by a high fly ball that had an exit velocity of just 73 mph. And a woman at Tropicana Field was hospitalized in 2016 after she was hit by a fly ball that found its way through a hole in the netting just to the left of the first-base dugout.\n\nThe efforts that other leagues make to ensure the safety of their spectators could serve as a blueprint for MLB. Take the Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball Organization, where the stadiums have netting from foul pole to foul pole. Whenever a ball is hit into the stands, fans are warned with loud whistles blown by staff stationed in their seating section, and animated warning videos are played before every game. As a result, unprotected seats are something of a luxury in Japan. The Tokyo Dome offers \u201cexciting seats\u201d near the foul lines, which come equipped with helmets and gloves.\n\nEven with extensive netting, no one will ever be completely safe at a baseball game. But there are ways for MLB to protect its fans from foul balls \u2014 particularly in the most dangerous areas of the park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that you just hold your breath for a second,\u201d Hill told The Los Angeles Times. \u201cYou just hope it hits a seat, not a person.\u201d\n\nNeil Paine contributed research.\n\nCheck out our latest MLB predictions.\n\nCORRECTION (July 15, 2019, 5 p.m.): A previous version of this story referred to the data as having been collected from the 10 most foul-ball-heavy games this season. It was actually collected from the 10 most foul-ball-heavy game days \u2014 one day included a doubleheader.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-watched-906-foul-balls-to-find-out-where-the-most-dangerous-ones-land/", "author": ["Annette Choi"]}, {"title": "What Our Inbox Tells Us About How Democrats Are Tackling Trump", "text": "Democrats running for president in 2020 are faced with a choice when making their pitch to voters: make attacking President Trump a key part of their message or ignore him and focus on introducing themselves and their ideas.\n\nOn the one hand, criticizing Trump could help candidates convince primary voters that they\u2019re able to defeat him, but depending on what shots they choose to take, they could risk alienating voters in the general election. So we wanted to see how the candidates tackled this choice by looking at one of the most direct ways they regularly communicate with voters \u2014 their emails.\n\nLindsey Cormack, who runs the DCinbox project, a public database of email newsletters sent by members of Congress, says emails, like tweets, can give us insight into how politicians try to brand themselves. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to deal with editors at the paper. They don\u2019t have to deal with booking an agent to be on a TV or radio program. They can really say anything they want.\u201d\n\nSo to get a better sense of what the candidates told their followers about Trump, we subscribed to the mailing list of every candidate that FiveThirtyEight considers \u201cmajor\u201d and looked at all the emails they sent in the month prior to the first Democratic debate. (Though, for a variety of reasons \u2014 including email targeting practices, engagement testing techniques and the fact that we haven\u2019t given money to any of these campaigns \u2014 we may not have received all the emails sent by all the campaigns. )\n\nOverall, the candidates have taken very different approaches. Some candidates, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, seem to be ignoring Trump almost entirely, while others, like former Vice President Joe Biden, are heavily peppering their emails with invocations of Trump. Even some lesser-known candidates like Montana Gov. Steve Bullock are going all in on Trump \u2014 every email we received from his campaign during this period contained a reference to the president.\n\nBiden\u2019s emails contained the second-most mentions of Trump. In total, we received 27 messages from his campaign that referenced the president by name. This strong focus on Trump seems aimed at portraying Biden as a strong general election candidate, which makes sense, as his perceived \u201celectability\u201d has been a central argument of his campaign.\n\nIn his emails, Biden has attacked Trump\u2019s campaign tactics, his policy stances and his values. Biden has even sent an email that, rather than concentrating on his campaign, asked readers to sign a petition to \u201ctell Donald Trump that welcoming foreign interference in our elections is unacceptable.\u201d Even many of Biden\u2019s fundraising emails are all about Trump, asking readers to \u201cimagine the shock on Trump\u2019s face\u201d when they hit their fundraising goal and collect enough to \u201ccompete with Trump\u2019s fortunes.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden mentions Trump often, his emails completely ignore the rest of the primary field \u2014 none of his messages mention another Democratic candidate by name. Another thing Biden never mentions? Impeachment.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a telling omission, because many other candidates have called for Trump\u2019s impeachment and are renewing those calls in their emails. The move could help them in the primary election, as impeachment is popular among Democrats, but could prove risky in a general election because most polls find that more Americans oppose impeachment than support it.\n\nIn the month leading up to the first debate, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Cabinet secretary Julian Castro, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Sen. Cory Booker, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and former Gov. John Hickenlooper all sent at least one email entirely devoted to calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. O\u2019Rourke, for example, sent a long email on May 30 explaining why he thought Trump should be impeached, and then a punchier one about two weeks later with \u201cDonald Trump\u201d as the subject line and \u201c\u2026 should be impeached\u201d as the only text in the body of the email, with a link to a petition.\n\nWhile Warren was the first 2020 Democratic candidate to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2014 she publicly embraced that stance after the April release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 we didn\u2019t receive any emails from her campaign that mentioned the topic in the month before the first debate. Likewise, Sanders has also called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, but didn\u2019t send us any impeachment emails during the period we looked at.\n\nSome candidates largely avoided talking about Trump at all in the month before the debate. For example, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg only mentioned Trump in one email, when he called Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexican goods \u201cpolitically-motivated gamesmanship.\u201d Warren also was largely silent on Trump in this period. Of the 56 emails she sent us that month, only four mentioned Trump, and of those four, only one focused on him for the bulk of the message. That email explained, \u201cOur campaign isn\u2019t about Donald Trump. That\u2019s because he\u2019s just the symptom, not the cause, of the crises we face as a country.\u201d And Rep. Tim Ryan, who sent us 78 emails \u2014 the most of any candidate \u2014 didn\u2019t mention Trump even once, although he, too, has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nBullock, on the other hand, mentioned Trump in every single email, often as part of a formulaic reminder to subscribers that he is the only presidential candidate to have won statewide office in a state Trump won.\n\nCandidates who have a harder time making an \u201celectability\u201d argument than Bullock varied widely in the tenor of their emails that mentioned Trump. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, for example, sent us fewer emails in the month leading up to the debate than most candidates, but he mentioned Trump in five of the seven emails he did send us. (And one the two that didn\u2019t mention the president\u2019s last name still used the hashtag #ConDon, which showed up in six of de Blasio\u2019s emails and is meant to imply that Trump is a con man.) In many ways, De Blasio seemed to be trying to out-Trump Trump, aggressively attacking him and using name-calling tactics that the president is known for. In one email, for instance, he called Trump a \u201cNew York con man who\u2019s just been made to smell his own BS\u201d and referred to Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, as Trump\u2019s \u201clapdog,\u201d whose insults were \u201ceven lamer than his boss\u2019s.\u201d But unlike de Blasio, most of the Democratic contenders seemed to have heeded former First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s advice to \u201cgo high\u201d when their opponents \u201cgo low\u201d and are trying to strike a different tone than the current president, rather than trying to outdo him.\n\nSo what does this tell us about how Democrats are crafting (or not crafting) their campaigns around Trump? Well, a few candidates, like de Blasio, Bullock and Biden, are at one extreme \u2014 mentioning Trump at practically every opportunity \u2014 and a few, like Ryan and Buttigieg, are firmly planted at the other extreme, remaining largely silent on Trump. But perhaps unsurprisingly, most candidates fall somewhere in between, striking a balance between talking about Trump and focusing on their own message. It\u2019s early yet, though, and some candidates\u2019 communication strategies might change as the primary progresses. Still, with so many Democrats running, the party will have collectively tried out many different avenues of attack before the general election. Ultimately, however, there will only be one Democratic nominee, and whoever that is, he or she will have a wide pool of pre-tested approaches to draw from.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democrats-are-campaigning-on-trump/", "author": ["Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "A Better Way To Evaluate NBA Defense", "text": "Basketball, in some sense, is fundamentally a shooting game. Shooting isn\u2019t the only important action that takes place on a basketball court, obviously. But if no one kept track of who was taking shots and making buckets, we\u2019d have, at best, an extremely fuzzy impression of which players were actually any good, even if we had access to all their other statistics.\n\nBut believe it or not, this had long been the situation when it came to measuring player defense. There are individual defensive statistics such as rebounds and steals, of course. But there\u2019s no direct measure of shooting defense (other than blocks, which account for a relatively small fraction of missed shots). If an opponent gets hot against your team and shoots 53 for 91 en route to scoring 130 points, we know your team defended poorly in the aggregate, but we don\u2019t know which players to blame.\n\nThat is, until a few years ago, when the NBA started publishing data on opponents\u2019 shooting. Last regular season, for example, NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert defended a league-high 1,426 shots, according to motion tracking data by Second Spectrum, which identifies the nearest defender on every field goal attempt. Opponents made only 45 percent of those field goal attempts, well below the roughly 49 percent that Second Spectrum estimates \u201cshould\u201d have gone in against average defense for a given distance to the basket.\n\nWe\u2019ve been obsessed with this opponents\u2019 shooting data for a while, in part because it sometimes seemed to track closely with players who had stronger or weaker defensive reputations than you would infer from other advanced statistics such as Real Plus-Minus. Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving was regarded as a slightly above-average defender by RPM last year, for instance. But his opponents\u2019 shooting data suggests he\u2019s a big liability instead. On the other hand, Toronto\u2019s Serge Ibaka was an excellent defender based on opponents\u2019 shooting, whereas RPM regards him as just average.\n\nSo this year, we decided to evaluate the opponents\u2019 shooting data in a more comprehensive way and incorporate it into our projection system, CARMELO. Just as CARMELO is a goofy backronym (Career-Arc Regression Model Estimator with Local Optimization) that honors one of our favorite players, Carmelo Anthony, we decided to give our new defensive rating a player-centric name, this time in honor of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Draymond Green, who has long been one of the best players in basketball by opponent shooting. So our new rating is called DRAYMOND, which stands for\u2026.\n\nDefensive\n\nRating\n\nAccounting for\n\nYielding\n\nMinimal\n\nOpenness by\n\nNearest\n\nDefender\n\n\ud83d\ude44\n\nAll right, so the acronym may or may not catch on. But it does get at one essential discovery we made in playing around with the opponents\u2019 shooting data: the idea of minimizing openness. The main goal of shooting defense, especially in today\u2019s spacing-centric, ball-movement-forward offensive era, is really to minimize the chance of an open shot.\n\nSo when I cited Gobert\u2019s numbers earlier in this article, for instance, the most impressive part was not that opponents shot poorly against him, although that helped the Jazz, of course. Rather, it was that he was the nearest defender on so many shots: about 26 shots per 100 possessions that he was on the floor last year as compared with a league average of about 17 shots defended per 100 possessions. By contrast, Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook \u2014 whom DRAYMOND regards as being vastly overrated by other defensive metrics \u2014 was the nearest defender on only 12 shots per 100 possessions. Some of this has to do with Westbrook\u2019s and Gobert\u2019s respective positions \u2014 centers naturally defend more shots than guards do, a factor that DRAYMOND corrects for (see below). But even accounting for that, it\u2019s clear that some players are much more impactful defenders than others.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re curious to see some data, but first, an explanation of how DRAYMOND is calculated. We\u2019ll keep it pretty brief.\n\nAs I mentioned above, what we\u2019re really interested in is how much value a defender provides relative to an open shot. That is to say, we generally don\u2019t want to punish a player for happening to be the nearest defender according to the Second Spectrum data. Some defense is generally better than none; if Player X hadn\u2019t defended the shot, it\u2019s possible that no one else would have.\n\nThrough trial and error, we found that DRAYMOND performs best if you assume that shooting percentages on open shots are about 8 percentage points higher than against average defense. For instance, if a certain type of above-the-break 3-pointer is made 34 percent of the time against average defense, we\u2019d expect it to go in about 42 percent of the time if it was truly open.\n\nThis allows us to calculate an initial score that we call RAW_DRAYMOND. For example, if a player faced 100 2-point shots and allowed 46 of them to go in when you\u2019d expect 56 percent of them to be converted if wide open, that player prevented \u2026\n\n(.56-.46) x 100 x 2 = 20\n\n\u2026 about 20 points from being scored with his defense. (Obviously, this player could have provided additional value based on his defense against 3-point shots. Indeed, since 3-point shots are worth more than 2-pointers \u2014 hashtag #math \u2014 players who are effective at defending threes are especially rewarded by DRAYMOND.)\n\nHowever, there are several adjustments we need to make in getting from RAW_DRAYMOND to regular DRAYMOND:\n\nSince DRAYMOND is based on both regular-season and playoff data, we adjust for the fact that defenders face slightly tougher shooters on average in the playoffs.\n\nWe divide RAW_DRAYMOND by the number of possessions that the player was on the floor, so that DRAYMOND (like RPM and most other NBA stats) is a rate statistic rather than a counting statistic.\n\nWe adjust the number of shots defended based on a player\u2019s position. The average point guard and shooting guard defends about 15 shots per 100 possessions, the average small forward defends about 16 shots, the average power forward 19 shots, and the average center 22 shots. This somewhat equalizes defensive value over the five positions. Even so, bigs are generally the most valuable defenders in basketball according to DRAYMOND, as they are under most other advanced statistics.\n\nFinally, we subtract the value of league-average shooting defense per possession from each player\u2019s score. Thus, like RPM and Box Plus/Minus (BPM), the statistics that CARMELO has traditionally used to make its projections, DRAYMOND is a plus-minus statistic measured per 100 possessions, where a score of 0 represents average defense.\n\nAmong players who have played at least 10,000 possessions over the past six seasons (the NBA\u2019s opponents\u2019 shooting data goes back to 2013-14), the top defender according to DRAYMOND is \u2026 Draymond Green, who has provided the Warriors with +3.2 points per 100 possessions of defensive value based on his scoring defense alone, not counting all of the other ways (e.g., steals) that he produces defensive value. Green is followed on the list by a fairly star-studded cast of defenders: Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis (!), Rudy Gobert, Tim Duncan, Andre Roberson and Anthony Davis.

To test this \u2014 and I have to apologize because there are a lot of similarly named statistics here with confusing acronyms \u2014 we regressed DRAYMOND and defensive BPM against five-year defensive Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (RAPM). What the hell does that mean? BPM is based on conventional box score statistics \u2014 most importantly rebounds, blocks and steals for the purposes of measuring defense. DRAYMOND is based on opponents\u2019 shooting. RAPM, meanwhile, measures how much better or worse a team plays when a player is on or off the floor. In the long run, RAPM is basically the \u201cright\u201d way to measure player value, since it can account for all the direct and indirect contributions a player makes that may or may not have a corresponding statistic attached to them. In the short run and even the medium run, however (remember all that misleading data people cited about how the Warriors were so good without Kevin Durant?), RAPM can be extremely noisy. So RAPM is great if you\u2019re looking back over a five-year sample, as we\u2019re doing here, but on-court/off-court statistics need to be treated with extreme caution over small samples.\n\nIn any event, what we found is that BPM and DRAYMOND basically do equally well in predicting long-term RAPM. What that means is that the opponents\u2019 shooting data is basically as powerful as all box score defensive statistics combined in predicting how much value a player\u2019s defense truly has over the long run.\n\nWe also found, however, that BPM and DRAYMOND are largely not redundant with one another. Blocks, steals and rebounds, which BPM captures, are certainly valuable things, and DRAYMOND does not purport to measure those. But they are also not especially good proxies for shooting defense. There are some players such as Green and Gobert who are even better defenders than you\u2019d gather from their box score stats, even though those stats are pretty good. But there are others like Trevor Ariza, who gets lots of steals but has been rated poorly by DRAYMOND in recent seasons. That doesn\u2019t mean that Ariza is a poor defender, just that you need to take the good (steals) with the bad (allows opponents to convert field goals at a high rate) when evaluating him.\n\nLet\u2019s conclude with a list of players who are most affected, positively or negatively, by the incorporation of DRAYMOND. The table below compares our old CARMELO defensive ratings, which were based on a mix of two-thirds RPM and one-third BPM, to our new version, which still uses these statistics but also uses DRAYMOND. Here are the old and new defensive ratings for everyone with at least 10,000 possessions played since 2013-14.\n\nWhich players\u2019 defense had been underrated or overrated?

Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There\u2019s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic.\n\nCases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents\u2019 shooting data than what we\u2019ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.\n\nWe used math to help LeBron cast \u2018Space Jam 2\u2019\n\nCheck out our NBA player ratings.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-better-way-to-evaluate-nba-defense/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "The State Of The State Of The States", "text": "Whether it\u2019s a groundbreaking experiment of conservative or liberal thought or \u201cmerely\u201d tending to the bread-and-butter issues that touch residents\u2019 lives, the states are where the policymaking magic happens. And because of the different roles played by the state and federal governments, what\u2019s happening in the states can vary pretty substantially from what\u2019s being discussed on the national level. So we decided to burst out of the bubble of the national 2020 campaign and take a look at what state leaders were talking about.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, each governor lays out their policy priorities in their version of the State of the Union address \u2014 a \u201cstate of the state\u201d address. We conducted a text analysis of all 50 governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches to see what issues were talked about the most and whether there were differences between what Democratic and Republican governors were focusing on. Specifically, we broke down the speeches into one-, two- and three-word phrases (like \u201cschool\u201d or the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) and divided the most commonly used ones into thematic buckets.\n\nWe found that the three most dominant issues were education, health care and the economy \u2014 although Democratic and Republican governors didn\u2019t always approach them in the same way. There were also interesting partisan differences in how governors talked about some other issues, including the environment, crime and justice, and mental health.\n\nEducation\n\nThe words \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cschool\u201d appeared in all 23 Democratic speeches and all 27 Republican ones. But that doesn\u2019t mean the two parties focused on the same aspects of education. To suss out those differences, we ran a statistical analysis to determine how significantly terms were associated with speeches from Democratic or Republican governors. And as you can see in the table below, some terms (e.g., \u201cchild care,\u201d \u201ckindergarten\u201d) were more likely to be used in Democratic speeches, while others (e.g., \u201cfoster care,\u201d \u201ceducation workforce\u201d) were more likely to be used in Republican speeches.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on education One-, two- and three-word phrases about education that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nchild care 0.02 39.1% 7.4% D+31.7 education need 0.00 30.4 0.0 D+30.4 kindergarten 0.07 47.8 18.5 D+29.3 early childhood 0.06 43.5 14.8 D+28.7 educational 0.12 21.7 48.2 R+26.4 students state 0.01 26.1 0.0 D+26.1 scholarships 0.10 13.0 37.0 R+24.0 graduate 0.22 56.5 33.3 D+23.2 learning 0.27 43.5 66.7 R+23.2 educators deserve 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 foster care 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 quality education 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 school district 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 graduates 0.19 17.4 37.0 R+19.7 teacher pay 0.19 17.4 37.0 R+19.7 early childhood education 0.13 30.4 11.1 D+19.3 graduation 0.24 21.7 40.7 R+19.0 education workforce 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 college tuition 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 schools year 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 special education 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 tuition 0.29 43.5 25.9 D+17.6 scholarship 0.27 17.4 33.3 R+15.9 teacher 0.51 52.2 66.7 R+14.5 best brightest 0.15 4.4 18.5 R+14.2 year degree 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 training programs 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 children future 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 community college 0.40 34.8 22.2 D+12.6 teachers 0.62 82.6 70.4 D+12.2 classroom 0.55 52.2 40.7 D+11.4 school districts 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 universities 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 school students 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 graduate high school 0.35 21.7 11.1 D+10.6 young children 0.35 21.7 11.1 D+10.6 bachelor degree 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 children foster care 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 school student 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 school boards 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 parents teachers 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 teacher pay raise 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 high school college 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 public schools 0.56 43.5 33.3 D+10.2 class education 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 world class education 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 dedicated teachers 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 high schools 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 teacher salaries 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 computer science 0.52 17.4 25.9 R+8.5 high school 0.74 69.6 77.8 R+8.2 superintendent 0.59 21.7 29.6 R+7.9 students 0.79 100.0 92.6 D+7.4 educators 0.72 43.5 37.0 D+6.4 university 0.77 56.5 63.0 R+6.4 early education 0.55 17.4 11.1 D+6.3 help students 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 colleges 0.73 39.1 33.3 D+5.8 day kindergarten 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 education opportunity 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 school buildings 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 funding education 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 state college 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 technical education 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 students parents 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 student debt 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 post secondary 0.63 13.0 18.5 R+5.5 middle school 0.63 13.0 18.5 R+5.5 local school 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 stem 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 math 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 public school 0.76 21.7 25.9 R+4.2 higher education 0.84 47.8 51.9 R+4.0 college 0.88 73.9 77.8 R+3.9 education funding 0.78 26.1 22.2 D+3.9 apprenticeship 0.80 21.7 18.5 D+3.2 schools 0.91 95.7 92.6 D+3.1 apprenticeship programs 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 college degree 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 education budget 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 education programs 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 good education 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 graduation rate 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 12 schools 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 local school districts 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 students like 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 students graduate 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 elementary school 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 colleges universities 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 schools need 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 classrooms 0.93 39.1 40.7 R+1.6 schools state 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 teaching 0.96 30.4 29.6 D+0.8 public education 0.96 30.4 29.6 D+0.8 12 education 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 elementary 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 community colleges 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 high school students 0.99 26.1 25.9 D+0.2 education 1.00 100.0 100.0 EVEN school 1.00 100.0 100.0 EVEN Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

But on the state level, those ideas came up in only a handful of gubernatorial speeches \u2014 mostly Democratic ones. Democratic governors were more loquacious about another progressive priority, \u201cearly childhood education,\u201d which was mentioned by seven Democratic governors and three Republican ones.\n\nHealth care\n\nAnother issue governors talked a lot about was health care \u2014 especially Democratic governors. That makes sense considering that health care was the No. 1 issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, which is when many of those Democratic governors were elected.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on health care One-, two- and three-word phrases about health care that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nsick 0.01 39.1% 3.7% D+35.4 affordable care act 0.01 39.1 3.7 D+35.4 health care 0.25 100.0 70.4 D+29.6 healthy 0.15 60.9 33.3 D+27.5 expand medicaid 0.02 30.4 3.7 D+26.7 access health 0.06 30.4 7.4 D+23.0 reproductive health 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 pre existing conditions 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 cost health 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 existing conditions 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 hospital 0.19 43.5 22.2 D+21.3 medical 0.32 65.2 44.4 D+20.8 epidemic 0.17 39.1 18.5 D+20.6 dr 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 access health care 0.10 26.1 7.4 D+18.7 health outcomes 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 health insurance 0.29 43.5 25.9 D+17.6 hospitals 0.26 34.8 18.5 D+16.3 doctor 0.24 30.4 14.8 D+15.6 health care costs 0.21 26.1 11.1 D+15.0 affordable health care 0.18 21.7 7.4 D+14.3 expanded medicaid 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 healthier 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 public health 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 behavioral health 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 health services 0.57 30.4 22.2 D+8.2 health 0.79 100.0 92.6 D+7.4 medicaid 0.74 52.2 59.3 R+7.1 quality health care 0.55 17.4 11.1 D+6.3 medicaid program 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 children health 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 health crisis 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 health challenges 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 illness 0.80 21.7 18.5 D+3.2 health substance 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 medicaid expansion 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

A lower p-value means that the partisanship of a phrase in our data set is more statistically distinguishable. Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nDemocratic governors were more likely than Republican ones to utter almost every health care-related phrase we looked at. For instance, more Democratic governors (nine of them, or 39 percent) used the phrase \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d (the health care law passed under former President Barack Obama) than Republican governors (one, or 4 percent). And four Democratic governors called for their states to \u201cexpand Medicaid\u201d \u2014 all of them, perhaps unsurprisingly, in states with divided government (where the governor, state Senate and/or state House are controlled by different parties). This could be because Medicaid expansion has recently passed in several red states and is broadly popular, making it a fertile issue for bipartisan cooperation. Or it could be simply because every Democratic-controlled state has expanded Medicaid already.\n\nMostly missing, however, from all the health care talk was an endorsement of a single-payer health-insurance system \u2014 a major policy priority of some Democratic presidential candidates. Democrat Gavin Newsom of California was the only governor to mention \u201csingle payer\u201d health care, or the idea that the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care with private insurance plans effectively eliminated, but he mentioned it only as a \u201clong-term goal.\u201d Likewise, only Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington urged his legislature to create a \u201cpublic health option,\u201d which would give people the ability to buy into a government-administered insurance plan. (His state went on this year to pass legislation that created this option.)\n\nThe economy\n\nThe third nearly ubiquitous issue in state of the state addresses was the economy. While rhetoric about jobs was bipartisan (\u201cjob\u201d or \u201cjobs\u201d appeared in every speech), Republican and Democratic governors approached other aspects of economic policy differently.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on the economy One-, two- and three-word phrases about the economy that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how

Interestingly, eight of the nine were speaking to a friendly (i.e., Democratic) legislature, indicating how raising the minimum wage is a priority for Democratic-controlled states.\n\nEnergy and the environment\n\nWe found differences among Republican and Democratic speeches on other policy issues as well.

There was a similar partisan split (11 to one) in calls for \u201cclean energy.\u201d By contrast, Republicans tended to framed their environmental goals around protecting \u201cnatural resources\u201d (a phrase that appeared in eight GOP speeches and three Democratic ones).\n\nCriminal justice\n\nCriminal-justice reform seems to be one of the few remaining bipartisan issues these days, and, fittingly, the term \u201ccriminal justice\u201d appeared in 13 Republican speeches and in 12 Democratic ones.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on criminal justice One-, two- and three-word phrases about criminal justice that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nprison 0.01 21.7% 74.1% R+52.3 enforcement 0.03 21.7 63.0 R+41.2 law enforcement 0.03 21.7 63.0 R+41.2 gun violence 0.00 34.8 0.0 D+34.8 public safety 0.10 30.4 63.0 R+32.5 corrections 0.04 8.7 37.0 R+28.3 violence 0.13 52.2 25.9 D+26.2 gun safety 0.01 26.1 0.0 D+26.1 prisons 0.10 13.0 37.0 R+24.0 school safety 0.06 4.4 25.9 R+21.6 correctional 0.14 13.0 33.3 R+20.3 gun 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 attorney general 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 local law enforcement 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 schools safer 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 prison population 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 crime 0.28 26.1 44.4 R+18.4 violent 0.32 21.7 37.0 R+15.3 offenders 0.38 17.4 29.6 R+12.2 criminal 0.62 52.2 63.0 R+10.8 violent crime 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 non violent 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 police officer 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 law enforcement officers 0.45 13.0 22.2 R+9.2 police officers 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 criminal justice reform 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 victims 0.76 21.7 25.9 R+4.2 criminal justice 0.84 52.2 48.2 D+4.0 state police 0.82 17.4 14.8 D+2.6 violent offenders 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 recidivism rate 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 police 0.96 43.5 44.4 R+1.0 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nBut Republican governors also lived up to their party\u2019s historical \u201ctough on crime\u201d reputation, at least through their rhetoric. For instance, they were far more likely to nod to \u201cpublic safety,\u201d a phrase used by 17 GOP governors but seven Democrats. And while 17 Republicans mentioned \u201claw enforcement\u201d in their state of the state addresses, only five Democrats did. Republicans also talked more about \u201cprisons\u201d and \u201ccorrections\u201d than Democrats did \u2014 however, their language surrounding it wasn\u2019t always \u201ctough.\u201d For example, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds touted her state\u2019s apprenticeship programs that try to reintegrate inmates in society: \u201cMost of our inmates aren\u2019t inmates for life. They will reenter society \u2014 and when they do, we want them to be successful. Those who can\u2019t get a job often find their way back to crime and then back to prison.\u201d Several other Republican governors discussed the need to reduce their \u201cprison population.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, it was mostly Democratic governors who talked about guns. For example, eight Democratic governors used the term \u201cgun violence,\u201d but no Republicans did so. Notably, only two Republican governors even mentioned the \u201cSecond Amendment.\u201d More frequently, Republicans talked about guns in the context of \u201cschool safety,\u201d a phrase used in seven GOP speeches and one Democratic one.\n\nMental health\n\nMore Republican governors (18) than Democratic ones (10) used the phrase \u201cmental health\u201d in their state of the state addresses, and a third of those Republicans \u2014 six of the 18 \u2014 did so in the context of violence in schools. For example, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said, \u201cTo keep our classrooms safe, we must also address the mental health issues that often lead to school violence.\u201d\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on mental health One-, two- and three-word phrases about mental health that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nmental health 0.27 43.5% 66.7% R+23.2 drugs 0.24 21.7 40.7 R+19.0 drug 0.44 43.5 59.3 R+15.8 addiction 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 mental health issues 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 opioid addiction 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 overdose 0.57 26.1 18.5 D+7.6 opioid 0.71 47.8 40.7 D+7.1 substance 0.69 30.4 37.0 R+6.6 mental health care 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 substance use 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 opioid crisis 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 substance abuse 0.78 26.1 22.2 D+3.9 mental health substance 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 mental health services 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 mental illness 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

A lower p-value means that the partisanship of a phrase in our data set is more statistically distinguishable. Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nOther Republicans spoke about mental health more broadly. For instance, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu discussed overhauling the state\u2019s mental health care system and reducing suicide rates. And four Republican governors brought up mental health in the context of drug addiction. Republicans were also likelier than Democrats to discuss \u201copioid addiction,\u201d but \u201copioid\u201d overall was relatively common in both Democratic and Republican speeches.\n\nAs for immigration and abortion, two issues that have recently been prominent on the national level, we didn\u2019t find a lot of discussion of them in the governors\u2019 speeches. Only three gubernatorial speeches included the word \u201cimmigration,\u201d and related terms were similarly rare. When they did come up, there was a noticeable partisan divide: For example, Democrats were more likely to use the word \u201cimmigrants\u201d (four speeches to two), while Republicans were more likely to reference the \u201cborder\u201d (five speeches to one). Similarly, just two governors mentioned abortion: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, who is a supporter of abortion rights, and Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, who is against abortion. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that state governments aren\u2019t legislating on abortion \u2014 we know that they are \u2014 but it\u2019s notable that so few governors mentioned it in their speeches.\n\nSetting partisan differences aside, a lot of governors agreed on one thing in particular: that the state of their state was strong! Of the dozens of governors who included the phrase \u201cthe state of our state is \u2026\u201d in their state of the state address, at least 16 followed it with \u201cstrong\u201d or some variation thereof \u2014 including \u201cstronger than ever,\u201d \u201cgrowing stronger each day\u201d and \u201chopeful, prosperous and strong.\u201d Others were more creative and said the state of their state was \u201csolid,\u201d \u201crock solid,\u201d \u201cfull of opportunity\u201d or \u201cdetermined.\u201d But a few were \u2026 less confident: \u201cThe state of our state is improving\u201d (ouch, Kansas); \u201cthe state of our state is that we\u2019ve got work to do\u201d (better get cracking, Wisconsin!).\n\nLaura Bronner contributed analysis.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americas-governors-are-talking-about/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich", "Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "Which 2020 Candidates Have The Most In Common \u2026 On Twitter?", "text": "The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates use Twitter like an earlier generation of politicians may have used a soapbox: to announce policy plans, solicit donations, marshal their supporters and criticize the current administration.\n\nEach of these candidates is speaking to his or her own virtual village square. But how many people spend time in more than one village? How much overlap is there between, say, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s audience and Bernie Sanders\u2019s? And which candidates are most often associated with one another, based on their Twitter followers?\n\nTwitter isn\u2019t real life, of course; it\u2019s an often-ridiculous short-burst social network that is decidedly not representative of the electorate at large. But it\u2019s still a slice of life. The people following candidates on Twitter are those who want to receive a steady stream of information about at least part of the 2020 campaign. Understanding how that tribe operates can tell us something about an influential slice of the electorate.\n\nSo off our web-scraper went, dredging up every follower of the 20 Democratic presidential candidates who FiveThirtyEight considered \u201cmajor\u201d in early May, when we ran our script. The result was a data set with almost 20 million entries, which you can download on GitHub.\n\nThis data reveals the obvious, such as raw follower counts. It also reveals more subtle trends, such as which candidates\u2019 followers are loyal, which cast a broad net, which seem to have a similar appeal and which apparently have nothing in common.\n\nFor starters, here are the candidates ranked by the share of their followers who don\u2019t follow any other 2020 Democratic candidate.\n\nCandidates whose followers are loyal only to them Share of each 2020 candidate\u2019s followers who don\u2019t follow any other candidates Account \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nFOLLOWERS \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nExclusive FOLLOWERS \u25b2 \u25bc\n\n@marwilliamson 2,610,335 \u2013 74.8% \u2013 \u2013 @BernieSanders 9,254,423 \u2013 63.2 \u2013 \u2013 @Hickenlooper 144,816 \u2013 56.3 \u2013 \u2013 @CoryBooker 4,246,252 \u2013 52.5 \u2013 \u2013 @JoeBiden 3,558,333 \u2013 43.8 \u2013 \u2013 @AndrewYang 267,897 \u2013 43.4 \u2013 \u2013 @TulsiGabbard 349,443 \u2013 34.7 \u2013 \u2013 @BetoORourke 1,424,745 \u2013 26.5 \u2013 \u2013 @amyklobuchar 692,985 \u2013 24.0 \u2013 \u2013 @PeteButtigieg 1,033,834 \u2013 23.7 \u2013 \u2013 @SenGillibrand 1,410,303 \u2013 23.3 \u2013 \u2013 @KamalaHarris 2,640,072 \u2013 22.3 \u2013 \u2013 @JulianCastro 212,582 \u2013 21.4 \u2013 \u2013 @sethmoulton 138,450 \u2013 20.1 \u2013 \u2013 @JayInslee 51,504 \u2013 19.0 \u2013 \u2013 @ewarren 2,486,101 \u2013 16.4 \u2013 \u2013 @TimRyan 20,080 \u2013 15.6 \u2013 \u2013 @JohnDelaney 20,266 \u2013 12.9 \u2013 \u2013 @MichaelBennet 21,053 \u2013 11.7 \u2013 \u2013 @ericswalwell 84,415 \u2013 9.2 \u2013 \u2013 Among candidates who were considered \u201cmajor\u201d by FiveThirtyEight as of May 8. Follower lists for each candidate\u2019s primary accounts (according to a CSPAN Twitter list) were scraped from May 8-15, except for @Hickenlooper, which was scraped on June 6 to correct a coding error.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of the people who follow Marianne Williamson \u2014 a \u201cspiritual and inspirational author, lecturer, non-profit activist,\u201d per her Twitter bio \u2014 don\u2019t follow any other Democratic candidate, putting them in a loyalty class all their own. Similarly, of the over 9 million people who follow Bernie Sanders, almost two-thirds follow no other candidate.\n\nThe 2.5 million people who follow Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, are more gregarious \u2014 84 percent of them follow at least one of her Democratic rivals. Ditto the 2.6 million people who follow Kamala Harris, 78 percent of whom also follow another candidate.\n\nDigging a little deeper into the follower interaction information, we can find out, for example, which other candidates Warren\u2019s followers are paying attention to. The Venn diagrams below try to answer that question, showing the overlap in followers between every candidate who had more than 500,000 followers in early May.\n\nThis chart reveals relatively large intersections between followers of Sanders and Warren, who share progressive policy platforms; between followers of Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke, who are both young, male and white; and between Harris and other major female candidates such as Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nFollower overlap patterns seem to share some similarities with Democrats\u2019 vote preferences, too. Morning Consult has been tracking voters\u2019 second-choice candidates, and according to the latest poll, respondents who planned to vote for Warren said their top backup choices were Harris and Sanders. Similarly, on Twitter, 60 percent of Warren\u2019s followers also follow Sanders, and 37 percent each follow Harris and Biden \u2014 her largest overlap groups.\n\nWith some simple calculations, we can look past the sheer size of each Twitter overlap and get a sense for which pairs of candidates share some quality (ideology, Twitter skills, who knows) that makes them appeal to the same people. Theoretically, people could be following multiple presidential candidates at random, but that\u2019s not how Twitter really works \u2014 if one account speaks to my interests, I\u2019m likely to be interested in similar accounts.\n\nTo figure out which candidates are getting paired up more often than we\u2019d expect based on chance alone, we rely on a number that data miners call \u201clift,\u201d which is the ratio of how many followers a pair actually has to how many followers we\u2019d expect them to have based solely on their individual Twitter popularity. For example, say we have 100 total Twitter users, and 50 of them follow Sanders while 10 of them follow Warren. If the reasons that a person followed Sanders had nothing to do with the reasons they followed Warren, we\u2019d expect the overlap between the two to be five users. If it turns out that 10 users follow both Warren and Sanders, then we have a lift value of two (twice as many as expected), which means we can speculate that the two candidates share some quality that appeals to the same people. If only one user follows both, then we have a lift of 0.2 (one-fifth as many as expected), and we would suspect that there\u2019s something about each candidate that drives away some people who follow the other candidate.\n\nIn the chart below, candidate pairs are organized by lift value, so those above the dotted line have more followers in common than you\u2019d expect by chance while those below the line have fewer.\n\nSome of the pairs that float above the line on this chart also stood out in the Venn diagrams, such as Harris and Warren, Harris and Gillibrand and O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg. O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro also have a relatively large overlap, perhaps because they\u2019re both from Texas. The small dots at the very top capture overlaps that are tens of times larger than we\u2019d expect to see if the candidates\u2019 appeals to followers were unrelated. That\u2019s probably because users who follow one lesser-known candidate such as Michael Bennet or John Delaney are likely to be highly engaged in the race and follow the other candidates as well. For example, the average Delaney follower also follows more than six other Democratic candidates.\n\nThe chart also reveals the candidate pairs who are not followed together. Williamson appears in most of these pairs, but the combination of Sanders and Booker also sinks to the bottom; their follower overlap is about half the size of what we\u2019d expect given their individual popularity.\n\nTwitter is just one front on which the fight for the Democratic nomination is being waged, but it does provide some insight into how candidates are using social media and who is listening. Democrats are, after all, looking for a candidate who can beat President Trump, who redefined how we view Silicon Valley\u2019s little blue bird.\n\nWe want to hear how you\u2019re using this data!

Questions, comments or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nA separation-of-powers showdown has been brewing since Democrats took control of the House in January. And with two new lawsuits directly attacking House Democrats\u2019 oversight authority, President Trump is now challenging whether one of Congress\u2019s most potent checks on the executive branch can be used to probe his finances.\n\nOver the past month, several House committees have issued subpoenas to banks with ties to Trump and an accounting firm that prepared several years of his financial statements, demanding a variety of documents. Trump has already declared that the White House won\u2019t cooperate with any of the Democrats\u2019 investigations, but he has little control over whether an external organization like a bank complies with a congressional subpoena. So he sued the banks, the accounting firm and House oversight committee Chairman Elijah Cummings. Trump is asking the courts to invalidate the subpoenas and arguing that they are an illegitimate exercise of Congress\u2019s oversight power.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold \u2014 and possibly even unprecedented \u2014 argument. Several legal experts told me that this appears to be the first time a sitting president has responded to a congressional inquiry by suing a member of Congress. They predicted that the cases will likely be difficult to win in court. Instead, they said, the lawsuits\u2019 real power lies in politics and delay: They help Trump feed a political argument that House Democrats are unfairly persecuting him, while the subpoenas could be tied up in the courts for months or even years. And the ripple effects could be much bigger \u2014 if Trump successfully evades congressional scrutiny in these cases and others, future presidents could be emboldened to challenge Congress in similar ways.\n\nDemocrats are arguing that the contested subpoenas to Deutsche Bank, Capital One and Mazars USA, the accounting firm, fall squarely under their oversight powers. Congress can conduct investigations related to legislation and the functioning of the executive branch, and Democrats say they\u2019re trying to learn whether Trump or his businesses are dependent on Russian money in a way that could influence his presidential decision-making. They\u2019ve also said the banking subpoenas are part of a broader effort to determine whether the banks are helping Russian clients get money out of Russia. This wider investigation could theoretically trigger further congressional action if it reveals that the banks were involved in illicit money laundering.\n\nBut Trump is arguing that Democrats are seeking details of his private financial dealings merely to score political points and that the subpoenas to the banks violate privacy laws. In the lawsuit against Cummings and the accounting firm, Trump\u2019s lawyers say that Democrats have \u201cdeclared all-out political war\u201d against the president, with subpoenas as \u201ctheir weapons of choice,\u201d and are trying \u201cto expose [Trump\u2019s] private financial information for the sake of exposure.\u201d And in the lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One, they write that the subpoenas are intended to \u201charass\u201d Trump and \u201cferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage.\u201d\n\nThese claims of overreach might play well with Trump\u2019s base, but the case itself is a long shot, said Cornell University law professor Josh Chafetz, who studies the relationship between Congress and the executive branch. \u201cCongress has incredibly broad oversight powers, and there are any number of areas where these records could be relevant,\u201d he said.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a completely open-and-shut case, however. Lance Cole, a law professor at Penn State University and an expert on congressional investigations, said that because courts have ruled in the past that Congress can\u2019t use its power to peer into citizens\u2019 private lives without some legitimate justification, a judge might be sympathetic to Trump\u2019s argument, particularly if Democrats are asking for lots of old financial documents. However, in the 1990s, Congress probed the details of a 15-year-old real estate deal involving Bill and Hillary Clinton as part of the Whitewater investigation, dredging up personal details from long before Clinton was president. That may bolster the argument that a president can\u2019t really be compared with an ordinary citizen. \u201cYou can debate the merits of the investigation, but it\u2019s hard for Trump to say that Congress has never done this before,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t need to prevail in these cases to deal the Democrats a significant setback, however \u2014 he just needs to ensure that the lawsuits are not immediately dismissed. That\u2019s because it can take months for a case to wend its way through the judicial bureaucracy before it goes to trial, and the subpoenas will likely be put on hold until the case is resolved. \u201cIt\u2019s completely possible we won\u2019t have an answer until after the 2020 election,\u201d said Margaret Taylor, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nSo the lawsuits are likely to help Trump whether or not he ultimately wins them. In the short term, they\u2019re feeding a broader political narrative of Democratic overreach. In the medium term \u2014 possibly through the entire election cycle \u2014 they will delay Democrats\u2019 efforts to access his financial records. The million-dollar question is what the impact will be on our political system in the long term. Taylor told me that it\u2019s deeply unusual for a president to argue that he\u2019s simply not subject to congressional oversight. \u201cSince Watergate, presidents have had their disagreements with Congress, but they have recognized that Congress has a valid oversight role,\u201d she said.\n\nRegardless of what happens with Trump\u2019s finances, this fight could be a sign of things to come. \u201cIf Trump continues to stonewall and the Democrats don\u2019t push back or their pushback is ineffective, future presidents will decide that they basically aren\u2019t answerable to Congress unless they want to be,\u201d Chafetz said.\n\nOther cases\n\nPresident Trump\n\nA case alleging that Trump is unconstitutionally accepting \u201cemoluments\u201d from foreign countries will be allowed to move forward. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that congressional Democrats\u2019 definition of emolument \u2014 which broadly encompasses any gift or payment from a foreign power \u2014 is more convincing than Trump\u2019s attorneys\u2019 narrower definition of an emolument as a payment received for services performed in the president\u2019s official capacity. Another emoluments case filed by the attorneys general of D.C. and Maryland is currently pending in an appeals court, but the scope of the Democrats\u2019 lawsuit is much broader \u2014 rather than focusing on Trump\u2019s Washington, D.C., hotel, it implicates all of Trump\u2019s businesses worldwide.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nOne of the cases challenging Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs, who said they were withdrawing from the suit because the money obtained through the declaration wouldn\u2019t be used to build barriers in the places where their clients are located. Many other lawsuits involving the national emergency declaration are ongoing.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments in April on a case about whether the Trump administration can add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Many observers reported that the court\u2019s conservative majority seemed willing to allow the addition of the question.\n\nThe Department of Justice filed a brief in a case involving the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, arguing that the entire law is unconstitutional, which is a reversal of its previous position that some, but not all, of the ACA should be struck down. A federal district court judge in Texas ruled in December that the ACA is unconstitutional because a 2017 law removed the tax penalty for not having health insurance. The case is now pending appeal.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland denied the Trump administration\u2019s request to dismiss a new set of lawsuits against the travel ban to the U.S. by residents of seven countries, including several where most of the citizens are Muslim. The Supreme Court allowed the policy to take effect last summer, but the new travel ban lawsuits are challenging the legality of its design and enforcement. The judge\u2019s ruling will allow the plaintiffs to obtain evidence about how the process of administering the ban is unfolding.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration pushes back against Democrats", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-trumps-latest-lawsuits-keep-congress-from-investigating-future-presidents/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Trump Is Losing The Legal Fight Against Sanctuary Cities, But It May Still Pay Off Politically", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nOn Friday, a federal appeals court handed down another setback for President Trump\u2019s effort to crack down on sanctuary cities, a campaign pledge that he has been fighting to fulfill since his first few days in office. The judges in the case ruled that the Trump administration could not withhold federal law-enforcement funds from cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents. The ruling came down on the same day that Trump declared a national emergency to secure funding to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 another effort to fulfill a key campaign promise, and one that will almost certainly be mired in a lengthy legal process where a win is far from guaranteed.\n\nWhy is the president so willing to dig in and risk legal defeat when it comes to his signature immigration issues? It might be because without cooperation from Congress, Trump\u2019s best shot at fulfilling some of his key campaign promises is to take bold \u2014 and possibly unconstitutional \u2014 actions and hope for a victory in the courts. Even a series of losses might seem better, from a political perspective, than doing nothing. As Christopher Lasch, a law professor at the University of Denver, told me, \u201cTo the extent that he can tell his base he\u2019s trying to do something, that\u2019s a win for Trump \u2014 regardless of how the cases turn out.\u201d In the case of sanctuary cities, what\u2019s at stake is the balance of power between the federal government and state and local authorities \u2014 and so far, judges have almost uniformly sided against the federal government.\n\nFrom the beginning, Trump and his administration have been fighting an uphill battle against sanctuary cities. Judges across the country \u2014 appointed by both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 have rejected several attempts by the administration to yank federal funding from cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration-enforcement efforts, and a federal judge in California refused the administration\u2019s request to suspend the state\u2019s sanctuary laws. \u201cThey\u2019ve been roundly defeated again and again,\u201d said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University.\n\nMany of these cases revolve around a federal law that says cities and states can\u2019t forbid their employees from communicating with federal agents about the immigration status of people in their jurisdiction. An executive order issued by Trump in his first few days in office and the conditions later placed by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions on law-enforcement grants both make federal funding at least partially contingent on compliance with federal agents. But legal experts told me that it\u2019s unconstitutional for a president to try to attach these kinds of strings to funding, because Congress controls spending and therefore only Congress has the power to impose conditions on federal grants. The law itself may also be unconstitutional under the 10th Amendment, which shields states\u2019 rights. Several judges have made this point in their rulings, relying on a 2018 Supreme Court decision that was authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito and overturned a federal sports gambling law on the grounds that it was \u201ccommandeering\u201d the states to enforce federal laws.\n\nThese recent lower-court rulings may have been predictable \u2014 at least to legal experts. But the Trump administration pressed on anyway, perhaps because the success of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda partially depends on his ability to get local law enforcement to work with federal agents. It\u2019s hard for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to locate undocumented immigrants without the help of state or local police.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more cost effective and efficient for ICE to pick people up who\u2019ve already been arrested and held in the local jail than to go find them in their home or elsewhere,\u201d said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. According to a 2018 report from his organization, 69 percent of ICE arrests during the first 135 days of the Trump administration were based on transfers from the criminal-justice system. The institute also found that California\u2019s share of overall ICE arrests fell after statewide sanctuary policies were implemented, while the share of arrests rose in some other parts of the country.\n\nGiven this context, it makes sense that the Trump administration would continue to fight sanctuary cities, despite the administration\u2019s string of defeats so far. And Trump may be banking on a more favorable hearing at the Supreme Court, which ultimately upheld his ban on travel to the U.S. from a number of countries, including several where the majority of the population is Muslim, after a series of losses in the lower courts. Most of the legal experts I spoke with were skeptical, though, that the justices would be willing to take the cases involving conditions on federal grants unless the administration wins in at least one appellate court.\n\nBut if the goal is to demonstrate to Trump\u2019s base that he\u2019s working to fulfill a key campaign promise, his record in the courts may not really matter. Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which seeks to decrease immigration to the U.S., said that Trump faces significant pressure from his base to do something \u2014 anything \u2014 to fight back against sanctuary cities, which is why it could be more politically costly to back down than to continue losing. \u201cThe people who support increased immigration enforcement are very frustrated with this status quo, and they want to see the Trump administration take it as far as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd the president may simply feel that he doesn\u2019t have much to lose by continuing to fight. Taking a few more defeats on sanctuary cities won\u2019t change much right away, since the administration is already losing across the board. It\u2019s possible that if California\u2019s sanctuary law is ultimately upheld, more states will decide to pass similar legislation, but that process would take time. And by tying state and local governments up in expensive legal battles, the administration could end up deterring some smaller or less firmly Democratic cities from enacting sanctuary policies, Lasch said.\n\n\u201cEven if he keeps losing, that reinforces the narrative that the Trump administration is trying to enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws and the courts are against them,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro, director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute. Trump could be making a similar calculation about declaring a national emergency: Settling in for a series of defeats in the short term could turn out to be a successful political strategy in the long run.\n\nOther cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nA federal judge ruled that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort intentionally lied to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, in violation of his plea agreement. As a result, Manafort\u2019s plea deal is no longer in effect, which means he could spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Roger Stone is now under a limited gag order issued by the same judge after Stone went on a media blitz last month discussing his indictment and arrest as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation. Then Stone posted a picture to Instagram that included a picture of the judge\u2019s face with crosshairs in the background, prompting the judge to schedule a hearing for Thursday to discuss the conditions of his release. Stone apologized to the judge and took the image down, but she indicated that his release on bail could now be in jeopardy.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nLast spring, a judge ruled that Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked people from viewing or replying to his posts on Twitter. Trump appealed the case to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where oral arguments were recently scheduled for March 26.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nOn Friday, another case involving Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 which removes the threat of deportation from certain undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children \u2014 will be argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Last spring in the same case, a federal District Court judge ruled that Trump\u2019s reasons for revoking the program were \u201cvirtually unexplained\u201d and the revocation was therefore illegal.\n\nWilliam Barr was confirmed as attorney general on Thursday, triggering the dismissal of several challenges to acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker\u2019s appointment last November.\n\nLast Friday, Trump declared the situation on the country\u2019s southern border to be a national emergency in order to secure funds to build a long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico. On Monday, the attorneys general of 16 states sued the president, arguing that his declaration violates the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. Another lawsuit has been filed against the president by an environmental organization and several landowners in south Texas who say they\u2019ll be affected by the construction of the wall, in addition to a separate lawsuit filed by several environmental and animal rights groups. A watchdog group is also suing the Department of Justice for failing to provide records related to the president\u2019s legal authority to invoke a national emergency. All of these cases have been added to the latest update of the Trump Docket data set.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s national emergency faces legal pushback", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-losing-the-legal-fight-against-sanctuary-cities-but-it-may-still-pay-off-politically/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Should Judges Pay Attention To Trump\u2019s Tweets?", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power.

His unfiltered public statements on Twitter and elsewhere have been a gift to the organizations and advocates fighting a range of controversial policy decisions like his proposal to ban most transgender people from serving in the military and the revocation of a temporary form of legal status for migrants who fled violence and natural disasters. Litigants have drawn on Trump\u2019s comments to argue that the administration was driven by bigotry and prejudice, rather than legitimate national-security or other policy concerns. The administration contends, meanwhile, that normal procedures were followed and that the policy decisions that resulted were the product of thorough deliberations.\n\nAnd this means that judges have to decide whether to take the administration\u2019s explanation at face value without addressing whatever Trump has said \u2014 or to evaluate Trump\u2019s comments as a crucial part of the story.

In many of those rulings, judges relied on the president\u2019s tweets and statements to conclude that the government\u2019s national security rationale simply wasn\u2019t convincing. But when the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts took a very different tack. Roberts upheld the travel ban, and in his majority opinion, he acknowledged Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims but ultimately concluded that Trump\u2019s order was grounded in legitimate national-security concerns.\n\nTo some extent, this approach was expected. In cases involving immigration, foreign affairs and national security, courts commonly defer to the president\u2019s authority when considering whether a particular action was valid. \u201cWhat\u2019s head-spinning about Trump is that there are a lot of cases where \u2026 there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of room for doubt about his intentions,\u201d said Richard Primus, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Michigan.\n\nIn the past, presidents might have had all kinds of ulterior motives for pursuing or supporting a particular policy, but they didn\u2019t say them at news conferences or on TV. \u201cUntil now, the executive branch has been kind of a black box,\u201d said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law. \u201cTrump is giving courts all kinds of insights that they might not have had in the past.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not necessarily clear what courts are supposed to do with those insights. In my conversation with Primus, he seemed skeptical that the Supreme Court would start probing Trump\u2019s motives in future cases. \u201cI think they will continue to insist on acting like they don\u2019t know the president\u2019s motivating attitudes,\u201d he said. If the court were to deviate from its typical practice in response to Trump\u2019s unusual behavior, it could create an awkward situation if the next president is more traditional \u2014 does the court revert to its previous practice or stick with the new approach? But staying the course has risks, Primus said \u2014 ignoring a president\u2019s motivation could lead to abuses of power in the present and the future.\n\nThe travel ban ruling now hangs over cases currently unfolding in the lower courts over DACA (a program originally created by President Obama that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation), the status of immigrants from Haiti and other countries, and the restrictions on transgender servicemembers. In each, Trump\u2019s tweets or statements are being used as evidence of discriminatory intent by the administration. And the administration\u2019s opponents are arguing that the government\u2019s actions were illegal in at least one of two ways: They violated the procedures set forth for administrative agencies, including a requirement that decision-making not be \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious,\u201d or they violated the constitutional rights of the people who were affected.\n\nSo far, lower court judges have seemed open to these arguments, but it\u2019s still early in the process. In one lawsuit related to the status of Haitian immigrants who fled to the U.S. after a 2010 earthquake, a judge issued an injunction last fall preventing the Trump administration from terminating the immigrants\u2019 legal status. In the ruling, the judge cited something Trump reportedly said in a meeting about a year ago suggesting that the U.S. might be better off prioritizing immigrants from Norway over migrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d like Haiti, El Salvador and Nigeria. He said that comment, along with another instance in which Trump reportedly said that 15,000 recent immigrants from Haiti \u201call have AIDS,\u201d raised \u201cserious questions\u201d about whether the administration\u2019s decision \u201cwas influenced by the White House and based on animus against non-white, non-European immigrants in violation of Equal Protection guaranteed by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nBut whether one of these cases will prompt the Supreme Court to be clearer about when \u2014 and how \u2014 a president\u2019s statements, and what they might suggest about his motivations, are relevant for the courts remains a big question. Nearly all the legal experts I spoke with emphasized that there are good reasons for courts to refrain from frequently probing the executive branch\u2019s motives \u2014 including the fact that they\u2019re often ruling on highly technical questions where administration officials, not judges, are the experts. And questioning presidential motives on a more routine basis could lead judges into situations where they appear to be making political decisions. \u201cThe risk here is that the courts become too involved in political debates,\u201d said Gillian Metzger, a law professor at Columbia University.\n\nAnd so in the meantime, the judges puzzling through these issues in their courtrooms may find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place, grappling with a question that Trump\u2019s presidency has posed in many different ways: How should the legal system respond to a norm-shattering president? On the one hand, they\u2019re in a position of significant power, with the ability to question what Trump is doing and why. But their responses to Trump could also change the fragile balance of power between the courts and the president in ways that are very difficult to predict.\n\nOther cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nRoger Stone, a Republican strategist and longtime adviser to Trump, was indicted last month by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team; Stone is accused of a variety of crimes related to his alleged attempt to cover up communications with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign. Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include witness tampering, making false statements and obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nA judge postponed the sentencing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in a Virginia court, where he was convicted last year on eight financial and banking fraud charges, because of an ongoing conflict over whether he breached his plea agreement in a separate case by lying to Mueller. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., scheduled a closed hearing on the plea agreement today.\n\nA lawsuit filed last year accusing Trump, his three eldest children and his company of using the Trump brand to entice vulnerable people into a fraudulent business deal was updated to include new allegations, including a claim that the Trumps profited from a marketing scheme aimed at teenagers.\n\nThe Trump administration", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-judges-pay-attention-to-trumps-tweets/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Why One of Trump\u2019s Biggest Legal Threats Is New York\u2019s Attorney General", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nAfter two years of legal wrangling, the Trump Foundation will soon be no more. Last month, in the midst of a dramatic month for cases that stem from President Trump\u2019s pre-presidency life, a judge signed off on a plan to shutter Trump\u2019s much-criticized personal foundation. Under the new agreement, the foundation will be dissolved under court supervision.\n\nIn effect, the deal implies that the foundation cannot be trusted to disburse its remaining $1.7 million to legitimate nonprofits. But even though the foundation is dissolving, the lawsuit against the foundation will continue, with the New York attorney general seeking damages for the foundation\u2019s alleged \u201cextensive and persistent violations of state and federal law,\u201d including the illegal use of foundation money to pay off legal settlements, buy portraits of Trump, and promote Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nThe December settlement is an important reminder of the risk that the state of New York poses for Trump. In particular, New York is uniquely well-positioned to go after Trump where it could hurt him most \u2014 through his businesses. In fact, New York has been one of the most significant and I\u2019d argue most underrated legal hazards for Trump since he began his campaign for president. Here are three reasons why.\n\nNew York has jurisdiction over Trump\u2019s family businesses\n\nPursuing legal challenges against Trump has become something of a sport among Democratic attorneys general over the past two years, but most of these fights focus on actions taken by Trump\u2019s administration rather than matters that implicate him personally. But because Trump\u2019s businesses and his presidential campaign are registered in New York, state officials have the authority to investigate and potentially prosecute him for violations of state law.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys have argued in a separate case that involves a former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant who\u2019s suing Trump for defamation in New York that as president, he should be immune to lawsuits in state courts. It\u2019s an open constitutional question, but two judges have already come down against Trump, saying that when unofficial conduct is involved, there\u2019s no reason to exempt the president from state lawsuits. The case is still being appealed, but even if it\u2019s decided in Trump\u2019s favor, legal actions could still be brought against his businesses or children.\n\nWorse still for Trump, state prosecutions are pardon-proof, since the president\u2019s power to grant clemency extends only to federal crimes. This means that while Trump could pardon an associate or family member implicated in, for example, the Mueller investigation (or even try to pardon himself), his get-out-of-jail-free card won\u2019t work in New York. There\u2019s even been a push to amend New York\u2019s double jeopardy laws to make it possible for someone convicted (and, hypothetically, pardoned) under federal law to be prosecuted for corresponding violations of state law.\n\nState prosecutors are especially tough on financial misconduct\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the offenses where Trump has the greatest potential liability in New York \u2014 for example, tax or other kinds of corporate fraud \u2014 are ones the New York attorney general\u2019s office is particularly adept at handling. Over the past 15 years, New York has steadily stepped up its prosecutions of financial crimes. \u201cFraud cases are the linchpin of what most attorneys general do, and the laws are particularly strong in New York,\u201d said Paul Nolette, a political science professor at Marquette University who studies state attorneys general.\n\nTrump knows this firsthand, because of a previous tangle with former attorney general Eric Schneiderman. The state sued Trump University for defrauding customers in a case that was settled for $25 million. And because Trump ran for office, opening his businesses to a whole new level of national scrutiny, the Trump Foundation lawsuit may have only been the beginning. Before he resigned last year, Schneiderman was reportedly cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller on matters related to Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and state tax officials said they\u2019re looking into potential massive tax fraud by the Trump family after reporting from The New York Times last fall. Meanwhile, New York\u2019s new attorney general, Letitia James campaigned on a promise to hold the president accountable across a wide range of issues, including his businesses and finances.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller investigation is the shiny object everyone is watching,\u201d Berit Berger, a former federal prosecutor and the executive director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity, told me. \u201cBut under everyone\u2019s nose are what look like much more straightforward violations of state law, including some pretty flagrant tax fraud. Depending on what happens with Mueller, that could be what actually sinks the big ship.\u201d\n\nNew York prosecutors may have the clearest shot at indicting Trump while he\u2019s president\n\nFinally, legal experts told me that if New York officials have sufficient evidence against Trump and the appetite for a protracted legal battle, they may have the best chance at testing a high-stakes constitutional unknown: Is it possible to issue a criminal indictment against a sitting president?\n\nUnlike their federal counterparts, state prosecutors are not bound by a Department of Justice policy that says that a sitting president is immune from indictment (a former president is fair game). \u201cI think it would be hard for a judge to tell New York that it can\u2019t pursue charges for criminal violations of its own state law by Donald Trump that occurred before he was president,\u201d said Andy Wright, former associate counsel to President Obama.\n\nNot everyone I spoke with agreed with this view, however. Andrew Coan, a law professor at the University of Arizona and the author of a new book about special prosecutors, said there might even be a stronger argument against allowing state attorneys general to indict a president. \u201cThe attorney general of New York only speaks for her state\u2019s voters, not the country as a whole,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it seems strange to let that person do something that would significantly impair the president\u2019s ability to serve.\u201d\n\nBut even without an indictment \u2014 which would unleash an epic constitutional showdown \u2014 New York could still threaten Trump\u2019s business empire through civil suits or prosecutions of his family members and inflict a significant amount of political damage on the president in the process.\n\nNone of this, of course, answers one key question: If New York is such a danger to Trump, why haven\u2019t prosecutors or the attorney general filed charges or a lawsuit against the president or his businesses?\n\nThe Trump Foundation case is actually a good example of why one shouldn\u2019t read too much into the state\u2019s relative inaction. Reports that the foundation was being used for Trump\u2019s personal benefit began while he was still running for office, but the lawsuit wasn\u2019t filed until 18 months after Trump took office. (There is currently one other case in New York involving Trump \u2014 the lawsuit from the former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant \u2014 that we\u2019re tracking as part of the Trump Docket.) But New York officials could be waiting until after Mueller\u2019s probe is concluded to take further legal action \u2014 or they might be investigating other instances of potential corporate fraud that we aren\u2019t yet aware of.\n\nOther cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nAttorneys for Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chair who was recently accused of violating his plea agreement with special counsel Robert Mueller, failed to fully redact sensitive details from a recent legal filing in the case. As a result, we learned that Manafort was accused of sharing presidential campaign data with a business associate who has links to Russian intelligence, and that during the campaign he discussed a plan for peace in Ukraine \u2014 which Russia and its allies were advocating as a path to lifting Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia. On Tuesday, a subsequent, correctly redacted filing from Mueller spelled out a few more details, including a confirmation that Konstantin Kilimnik, a former Manafort aide with alleged ties to Russian intelligence, is still a focus of the investigation.\n\nSentencing may be postponed for Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide and business partner of Manafort, who has been cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigation. Prosecutors requested a two-month delay in his sentencing because Gates is still assisting with \u201cseveral ongoing investigations.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\n\nAlthough the case is paused until the partial government shutdown ends, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments in the District of Columbia and Maryland\u2019s emoluments lawsuit against Trump for the court\u2019s March 19-21 session.\n\nThe Trump administration", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-one-of-trumps-biggest-legal-threats-is-new-yorks-attorney-general/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Will The Supreme Court Fast-Track Cases Involving Trump?", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nIf the Supreme Court justices have been trying to signal that they want a quiet term \u2014 perhaps some time to recover after Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s hyper-partisan confirmation hearings last fall, which may have shaken public faith in the court as an impartial institution \u2014 the Trump administration hasn\u2019t gotten the hint.\n\nOver the past few months, the solicitor general\u2019s office has blanketed the court with requests to bypass the normal legal process and rule swiftly in high-profile cases. Even after the court rebuffed attempts to halt the first Census trial and a climate-change lawsuit, the Trump administration kept trying, asking the justices to cancel an injunction against Trump\u2019s asylum ban. In an even more unusual move, the White House also asked the court to leapfrog lower courts and intervene in cases involving Trump\u2019s decision to revoke the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the administration\u2019s policy against transgender military servicemembers.\n\nThe justices rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to block the injunction against the asylum ban in December, but only by a narrow 5-4 margin and several other requests are still pending. How the court responds will tell us a lot about what Trump might be able to expect from the court\u2019s newly minted conservative majority.\n\nThe high court does have the power to short-circuit the appeals process, but requests to do so are rare \u2014 and it typically happens only in extreme situations, such as when President Richard Nixon refused to turn over tapes of conversations recorded in the White House during the Watergate investigation. But the Trump administration appears to be betting that, given enough pressure, the court\u2019s conservative majority will step in to save signature parts of the president\u2019s agenda. At the same time, these tactics could put justices like John Roberts \u2014 who is known for his concern about the court\u2019s reputation \u2014 in a pickle, if they want to avoid the perception that the court is simply bending to Trump\u2019s will.\n\n\u201cTaking these cases would suggest that the court is willing to treat the Trump administration as if the normal rules don\u2019t apply to it,\u201d Joshua Matz, a constitutional lawyer and publisher of the Take Care blog, which covers Trump-related legal issues, said. \u201cAnd it would also have the effect of essentially putting the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s entire domestic agenda on the Supreme Court\u2019s docket this year.\u201d\n\nAt least one case involving the administration is already on the court\u2019s schedule. In November, the justices agreed to rule on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other high-ranking officials could be required to testify about their reasons for adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census. Those oral arguments are slated for February. Why the court agreed to hear this part of the case is still a bit of a mystery, since Ross never testified and the justices didn\u2019t halt the trial, which means the lower court judge might, in the meantime, issue a ruling that has nothing to do with the administration\u2019s rationale for adding the question \u2014 potentially making the dispute over whether they can be compelled to testify irrelevant. (Meanwhile, the trial in a separate lawsuit over the citizenship question is scheduled to begin on January 7, despite the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to slow it down, and another set of cases related to the question seem likely to go to trial later this month.) But the court\u2019s decision to take the case shows, at the very least, that the justices aren\u2019t unwilling to entertain out-of-the-ordinary requests from Trump. And that might explain why Trump administration lawyers are deluging the court with petitions, hoping that at least a few more will rise to the top.\n\nIn some of those cases, though, the Trump administration has a tall order \u2014 they have to convince the justices not just that the issues in the case are important, but that there\u2019s a genuine need to rule on them early, before other courts have had their say. This was less of an issue for the Census case; since forms for the 2020 Census are due to be printed in June, the court had to act quickly. But the Trump administration is arguing that several other cases are pressing enough to make the cut for this year\u2019s docket too, rather than waiting until the next term, which doesn\u2019t start until October. That\u2019s in part because \u2014 according to the administration \u2014 lower court judges have been too aggressive in blocking Trump\u2019s policies from going into effect while they\u2019re being challenged.\n\nIf the administration succeeds in convincing the court, the ongoing litigation over DACA could end up on the justices\u2019 agenda. They\u2019re helped by the fact that one appeals court has already ruled that Trump couldn\u2019t immediately revoke deportation protections. But the lower courts still haven\u2019t ruled on the substance of Trump\u2019s DACA decision \u2014 they have simply said the people challenging it have enough of a chance at success that the program shouldn\u2019t be revoked in the meantime. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell Law School and immigration law expert, said it would be somewhat unusual for the high court to intervene at this stage. He added that the DACA case lacks the \u201cimmediacy\u201d of the travel ban case, where thousands of people were being prevented from entering the country, so there\u2019s not the same sense of urgency for the Supreme Court to act. But Matz and other legal experts told me that the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling could still provide enough of a reason for the Supreme Court to take up the issue this term.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s recent plea for the Supreme Court to hear the transgender military ban cases \u2014 or, barring that, to at least allow the ban to go into effect \u2014 seems likelier to prompt a response of \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry?\u201d Several district court judges have blocked the administration from implementing the latest version of the policy, but an appeals court has yet to rule on whether those injunctions are valid. The plaintiffs are arguing that it\u2019s not as urgent as the government\u2019s lawyers claim, since they have already missed several opportunities to expedite it. \u201cWe\u2019re still very early in the process,\u201d said Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. \u201cAnd there just isn\u2019t much evidence that this is a dire emergency.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s disregard for protocol could also backfire, if the justices decide that they simply don\u2019t want to be rushed. The justices\u2019 decision to reject Trump\u2019s request to lift the injunction against the asylum ban could be a sign that they\u2019re growing impatient with the administration\u2019s tactics. Whatever happens, their responses to the Trump administration this month will be an important indicator of how the court\u2019s conservative wing \u2014 and in particular, Chief Justice Roberts \u2014 sees their relationship with the president.\n\nOther Cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nMichael Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer and \u201cfixer,\u201d was sentenced to three years in prison for financial crimes, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. He was also told to pay nearly $2 million in financial penalties. The judge lowered his sentence from a maximum of more than five years because of his cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nSentencing for former national security advisor Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI last year, was postponed until Flynn has completed his own cooperation agreement with Mueller.\n\nActress Stormy Daniels was ordered to pay nearly $300,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees to Trump, after a judge dismissed a defamation lawsuit she and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, filed against Trump last year. Avenatti has indicated that he\u2019ll appeal the ruling.\n\nThe Trump Foundation agreed to dissolve under court supervision, amid a broader legal dispute about whether the foundation was used to make illegal payments to the Trump campaign. The rest of the lawsuit, which was filed by the New York attorney general last summer, will continue to move forward.\n\nA judge ruled that a group of plaintiffs who are suing the Trump family for allegedly using their brand to lure vulnerable investors into making sham investments can remain anonymous. Allowing plaintiffs to use pseudonyms is unusual, but the judge wrote that their fear of retaliation from the president or his followers is \u201creal\u201d and \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\n\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to hear a case involving Trump\u2019s alleged violation of the Constitution\u2019s foreign and domestic emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from receiving gifts from foreign governments. A lower court judge had recently issued a set of rulings allowing the plaintiffs in the case, the District of Columbia and Maryland, to subpoena Trump businesses. But Trump\u2019s lawyers are arguing that producing these documents would be a \u201cdistraction to the President\u2019s performance of his constitutional duties.\u201d This means that the lower court proceedings are frozen until the appeals court rules. The appeal has also been temporarily halted by the court, however, after Trump\u2019s attorneys told the court that the government shutdown was preventing them from being able to do their work.\n\nThe Trump Administration", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-supreme-court-fast-track-cases-involving-trump/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Why It Might Be Impossible To Overturn A Presidential Pardon", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nIf the American president has a superpower, it might be the ability to grant pardons. With the stroke of a pen, the president can wipe away the consequences of a federal criminal conviction, without having to ask permission from Congress or prepare for a battle in the courts. In the past, presidents have used this power in a variety of sweeping and controversial ways, perhaps most famously when Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, for any crimes he might have committed while in office.\n\nBut President Trump has an undeniably expansive and unusual view of the pardon power. He has declared that he has the ability to pardon himself, but that question is far from settled, in part because no other president has tried to do it. And his recent refusal to rule out a pardon for his former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, who tanked a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller, has prompted speculation about whether Trump is considering pardoning Manafort or other subjects of the Russia investigation.\n\nOf course, Trump has yet to pardon Manafort (or himself). But an ongoing case involving Trump\u2019s pardon of Joe Arpaio, the controversial former Arizona sheriff (we\u2019ve added the case to our Trump Docket data in the latest update), does raise important questions about limits on a president\u2019s ability to grant pardons. This case offers a sneak peek into the kinds of arguments that could be made if Trump issues a pardon to someone like Manafort. But it also shows why, as long as he doesn\u2019t pardon himself, asking the courts to overrule Trump\u2019s pardons may be a stretch, since the pardon was arguably designed to be a boundless power, with only Congress and the voters as a check on its abuse. \u201cThis authority is pretty explicitly given to the president away from the courts,\u201d Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, Austin, told me. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be worth all that much if the courts had the power on a case-by-case basis to adjudicate whether individual pardons were invalid.\u201d\n\nYou may recall that in August 2017, Trump announced that he was pardoning Arpaio, who was known for his hardline immigration enforcement tactics as sheriff. At the time, Arpaio had been convicted of contempt of court after he refused to comply with a federal court\u2019s order to stop racially profiling Latinos during patrols. The pardon was disturbing to many legal experts, who were concerned it had stripped the court of the only mechanism by which it can enforce its decisions, leaving it unable to fulfill its constitutional obligations to people whose rights were violated.\n\nIf Arpaio had simply accepted his pardon and moved on, the story might have ended there. But he took the unusual step of petitioning the judge in his case, Susan Bolton, to vacate his conviction. People who have been pardoned don\u2019t typically try to have their criminal records erased \u2014 the pardon absolves them of all the consequences of a crime but doesn\u2019t change the fact that there was a conviction \u2014 but Arpaio argued that since he hadn\u2019t yet been sentenced, the conviction should also be wiped from his record. Several advocates and law professors saw an opening and filed amicus briefs asking Bolton to cancel Arpaio\u2019s pardon on the grounds that a pardon can\u2019t be used to absolve officials who infringe on others\u2019 constitutional rights. \u201cA president couldn\u2019t pardon all white people for a specific crime but not people of color, because that would violate the Equal Protection Clause,\u201d said Aditi Juneja, a spokesperson for Protect Democracy, one of the advocacy groups challenging Arpaio\u2019s pardon. \u201cSimilarly, the pardon power is constrained by other parts of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn her ruling last fall, Bolton said the pardon was valid and refused to further engage with the question of whether the pardon should be overruled. That said, she did also refuse to vacate Arpaio\u2019s conviction, saying that the pardon removes punishment, but doesn\u2019t, in the words of a previous ruling, \u201cblot out guilt.\u201d Arpaio appealed her decision, and the case is now pending in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (the president\u2019s least favorite circuit court), where a new set of judges will soon decide whether to take the question of the constitutionality of Arpaio\u2019s pardon more seriously.\n\nPardons are criticized but rarely questioned\n\nPerhaps even more than other constitutional provisions, the pardon was built on the hope that presidents would have the good sense not to abuse it. During their debates over the pardon power, the founders actually considered an exception that would stop a treasonous president from absolving co-conspirators who had also committed treason, but they ultimately decided against adopting it. The Constitution does outline a few limits to the pardon power \u2014 it only applies to crimes (not lawsuits), it can only be used to forgive federal (rather than state) offenses, and it can\u2019t be used in cases of impeachment \u2014 and the courts have, over time, sketched out a few more boundaries.\n\n\u201cThere is a check on a president who abuses the pardon power,\u201d Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University and an expert on pardons, told me. \u201cHe gets voted out of office or he is impeached.\u201d Although a president hasn\u2019t yet been impeached for an unpopular pardon, Ford\u2019s popularity did suffer after he pardoned Nixon, and that may have cost him the 1976 election. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton also granted risky pardons \u2014 Bush functionally ended the Iran-Contra investigation, in which he was implicated, by pardoning six former Reagan administration officials, and Clinton pardoned his half-brother. But both Bush and Clinton granted these pardons in the waning days of their presidencies, when the political consequences weren\u2019t as severe.\n\nBut generally, even though past pardons have been criticized and even investigated, the legitimacy of a president\u2019s pardon hasn\u2019t been questioned in the way that Trump\u2019s pardon of Arpaio is being debated. Trump\u2019s actions and rhetoric have, however, exposed a loophole in the pardon power: Even if a pardon is arguably an abuse of presidential power, there\u2019s currently no clear way to undo the pardon itself. So now the question before the courts is whether Trump\u2019s actions are extreme enough to warrant blowing up the constitutional status quo. Advocates of pardon restrictions say that their arguments really aren\u2019t that radical \u2014 they just think pardons shouldn\u2019t override the rest of the constitutional system. What remains to be seen is whether the courts feel the same way \u2014 or whether they\u2019ll tell Trump\u2019s critics to take their grievances to Congress.\n\nOther cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nLast week was big for special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and closely related cases, particularly for three cases we\u2019re tracking: United States v. Manafort, United States v. Cohen, United States v. Flynn.\n\nLate Friday, Mueller\u2019s team released a memo arguing that Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chair, told \u201cmultiple discernable lies\u201d to investigators in violation of his plea agreement. Much of the memo was redacted, but some of the alleged lies were related to Manafort\u2019s contacts with the Trump administration and with a former Manafort aide who has ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nProsecutors in the Southern District of New York and Mueller\u2019s team also released two separate sentencing memos for Michael Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer. In the Southern District of New York\u2019s memo, prosecutors alleged that Trump, while he was a candidate for president, directed Cohen to make illegal payments to two women to keep them from airing details about past affairs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mueller\u2019s team filed a sentencing memo in the case of Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security advisor who last year pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. According to the memo, Flynn gave \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to Mueller\u2019s probe, but heavy redactions made it impossible to learn much more than that.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nOne of the three cases that challenge Trump\u2019s alleged \u201cemoluments\u201d \u2014 that is, illegal gifts from foreign and state governments that critics claim he receives in the form of profits through his businesses \u2014 is speeding ahead, at least in legal time. Last week, Judge Peter J. Messitte released a schedule for discovery in the case, District of Columbia v. Trump, which is set to conclude next summer. The plaintiffs have said they\u2019ll subpoena evidence from as many as 13 private entities connected to Trump, including the Trump Organization. But the process could be derailed: Justice Department lawyers and private lawyers representing Trump have vowed to fight the order with an unusual appeal to the 4th Circuit, asking the higher judges to declare Messitte\u2019s discovery order to be illegal or improper.\n\nThe Trump Administration", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-it-might-be-impossible-to-overturn-a-presidential-pardon/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "What Trump\u2019s Legal Battles Tell Us About Presidential Power", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nWhile he loudly calls the media\u2019s attention to issues like immigration and trade agreements, President Trump is quietly testing the limits of his authority through the courts. His views of executive power and separation of powers are, in dozens of different cases, forcing the legal system to answer knotty \u2014 and sometimes unprecedented \u2014 questions about what the U.S. president is really allowed to do.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon, of course, for presidents to push at the boundaries of the presidency and for the courts to rein them in. But Trump stands out for both the range and breadth of the constitutional questions that have been raised during his presidency, which isn\u2019t yet 2 years old \u2014 from his attorney\u2019s claim that a president can never obstruct justice to his declaring that he has the right to pardon himself. To be clear, neither of those legal questions is being considered by courts at the moment (although if Trump tries to pardon himself, I can promise that will go before a judge in record time), but there are plenty of other consequential cases currently working their way through the judicial system. Disputes about the scope of presidential authority are never easy for judges to resolve, but Trump\u2019s unorthodox statements and actions are making it even more difficult for the courts to determine when, and how, to place limits on the president.\n\nWhether the courts reject Trump\u2019s actions or allow them, the results of these cases will leave their mark on our country long after this administration is over, because they\u2019ll be enshrined in law. So far, the nation\u2019s highest court has upheld a policy restricting travel to the U.S. by people from several nations, some of which are majority-Muslim \u2014 still one of Trump\u2019s most controversial actions. Others seem likely to end up at the Supreme Court; indeed, one aspect of the legal fight over the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census will go before the court in February. Although many lower courts have been skeptical of the legality of some of Trump\u2019s actions, Trump and the Republican Senate are remaking the federal judiciary through a record-setting series of conservative judicial appointments, which could have implications for how similar cases are received in the future.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re launching The Trump Docket, a column that will explore some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape the contours of presidential power for years to come.\n\nTo do this, I\u2019ve assembled an initial set of cases to track and investigate and divided them into three categories (Pre-presidency Trump, President Trump and the Trump administration) based on the nature of their connection to the president. The list is far from exhaustive, and the choices I\u2019ve made are admittedly subjective, although I\u2019ve consulted more than a dozen legal experts and political scientists along the way. I\u2019ll add and subtract cases as they arise or are resolved, but my aim overall is to isolate a group of legal challenges that illuminate the range of Trump-related issues that are currently in the courts. And every week or two, I\u2019ll dive into what a particular case or set of cases means \u2014 for Trump personally, his presidency and our democracy. For today\u2019s column, I\u2019m going to walk through some of the major cases in each category and outline their stakes.\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nTrump was elected with several dozen active lawsuits against him, so it\u2019s not surprising that he\u2019s still battling cases that involve conduct from before he was president. But several are now forcing courts to grapple with how our justice system should treat a president who is being sued. And the ongoing special counsel investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election has raised the specter of whether the chief executive can be criminally indicted. In this category, I\u2019ll follow cases involving conduct from Trump\u2019s pre-presidency days (even if the lawsuit or charges were filed after Trump became president), including:\n\nA lawsuit filed by former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Summer Zervos, who is accusing Trump of defamation for calling her a liar after she said he had sexually harassed her.\n\nAdult film actress Stormy Daniels\u2019s dispute with Trump over a hush-money deal she signed during the 2016 election campaign.\n\nNew York state\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump Foundation \u2014 which Trump announced after the 2016 election that he would dissolve, saying that he wanted to avoid conflicts of interest \u2014 that argues the Trump family\u2019s charitable organization repeatedly violated both state and federal laws.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nTrump\u2019s unwillingness to divest from his businesses after he became president and his aggressive Twitter presence haven\u2019t just raised eyebrows \u2014 they quickly spurred legal action. In this category, I\u2019ll be looking at cases related to Trump\u2019s conduct as president that have raised questions about limits on a president\u2019s personal behavior and how much power the courts have to rein him in. These cases include:\n\nThree separate lawsuits that claim Trump\u2019s business ties are in violation of anti-corruption clauses in the Constitution that prohibit federal officials from receiving domestic and foreign \u201cemoluments,\u201d or financial benefits, without congressional approval. Cases have been brought by Democrats in Congress, a watchdog group and concerned private citizens, and the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, D.C.\n\nA case brought by people who have been blocked by Trump on Twitter and claim that the president is violating their First Amendment rights.\n\nA lawsuit from a professional writers organization that claims Trump is using his office to punish members of the media whom he dislikes and is asking the courts to stop him.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nThis category is both the biggest and the trickiest to define. That\u2019s because every administration is constantly engaged in court battles over the way they\u2019re interpreting laws and regulations, but those fights don\u2019t often revolve around constitutional issues. We also wanted to focus on the policies that press at the boundaries of the president\u2019s power, relative to the other branches of government \u2014 as well as disputes that we might not expect to see in another administration. These cases include:\n\nThe multiple, ongoing legal battles over whether the executive branch can withhold funding from so-called sanctuary cities, which are places that have instituted policies limiting local cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\n\nA challenge from a lobbying group that represents steel traders, who claim that Trump overstepped his constitutional bounds by imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nLawsuits attacking the Trump administration\u2019s revocation of \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d \u2014 a designation that shields migrants from deportation if they\u2019re from certain countries experiencing natural disasters or conflict \u2014 for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan; they say that the president was motivated by racially discriminatory views against people from these countries.\n\nThe fight over whether the Trump administration\u2019s plan to exclude transgender people from the military is constitutional.\n\nYou can see \u2014 and follow \u2014 the full set of cases here. I\u2019ll periodically update the data set with the latest on each case, and I\u2019ll post new and interesting information on Twitter. And don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you think an important case is missing or if there\u2019s an interesting angle on one of these cases you\u2019d like us to explore. We want this column to answer your questions about how Trump is changing the presidency, so please be in touch.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 26, 2018, 5:10 p.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that the Trump Foundation had been dissolved.

They Just Completely Disagree On What It Says.", "text": "Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nPoll(s) of the week:\n\nIt has been a little over two weeks since special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election was released, and so far the majority of Americans seem to think the report was both fair and accurate. But, as we\u2019ll see, there is still deep disagreement about what Mueller\u2019s findings actually show.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted in the week following the report\u2019s release, 51 percent of Americans felt that the report was fair and even-handed while only 21 percent felt that it was not. What\u2019s more, both Democrats and Republicans were equally likely to say the report was fair \u2014 53 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of Republicans said so. And a YouGov/Huffpost poll that was conducted right after the report was released found that just over 70 percent of both Democrats and Republicans thought the report was accurate \u2014 in each case, about 40 percent thought it was \u201cvery\u201d accurate and about 30 percent thought it was \u201csomewhat\u201d accurate.\n\nThis may be related to an uptick in the number of Republicans who said they had favorable views of Mueller after March 24, when Attorney General William Barr released a four-page summary of Mueller\u2019s findings. Pollsters like AP-NORC and Marist have found sharp upticks in the number of Republicans who said they thought the investigation was fair after the summary was released. And as you can see in the chart below, Republicans are now more likely to view Mueller\u2019s work favorably \u2014 his job approval ratings are now almost equally high among members of either party, though as Republican opinion has gone up, some polls found Democratic opinion dropped slightly.\n\nMuch of this change in opinion happened right after Barr\u2019s summary was released \u2014 so far, making the full report public does not seem to have shifted opinions about the investigation nearly as much as the summary did.\n\nMoreover, while both Democrats and Republicans generally believe the report was accurate and fair, they don\u2019t seem to agree on its contents, and their perceptions of whether Trump obstructed justice remain largely unchanged. The majority of Republicans believe that Trump did not obstruct justice, while the majority of Democrats believe that he did, according to a series of Washington Post polls, including the most recent one, one conducted after Barr\u2019s summary was released, and one conducted while Mueller\u2019s investigation was still ongoing. Democrats and Republicans also don\u2019t agree on whether the report exonerates Trump. According to the most recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, 61 percent of Republicans and only 6 percent of Democrats think the Mueller report cleared Trump of all wrongdoing.\n\nOpinions on obstruction haven\u2019t changed much Responses by party to a question asking whether Americans believe Trump interfered with the Mueller investigation in a way that amounted to obstruction of justice Democrats Republicans yes no yes no August 2018 80% 10% 19% 71% March 2019 80 16 21 77 April 2019 81 10 13 77 Source: Washington Post/ABC and Washington Post/Schar School Polls\n\nPartisans also disagree about what Congress should do now. When asked to choose between four possible next steps, a recent Marist poll found that only 27 percent of Democrats wanted to start impeachment proceedings while 56 percent preferred that Congress continue to investigate potential wrongdoing. The other two options were unpopular with Democrats: 6 percent said Congress should publicly reprimand the president, and 7 percent said that it should take no action. By contrast, 82 percent of Republicans in the poll wanted Congress to take no further action. And that April Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 56 percent of Americans think Congress should not begin impeachment proceedings, which is a 10-point jump from last August. A CNN poll conducted last week also found that a majority of Americans in both parties think Congress should look into why the Justice Department started the inquiry that led to Mueller\u2019s investigation, an action Trump has called for.\n\nAmericans \u2014 and especially Republicans \u2014 seemed to gain faith in Mueller once the investigation ended and Barr\u2019s summary was released, but public opinion does not seem to have changed much since the full report was released. There are still deep partisan divisions about what exactly the report revealed, what it means for the president, and what the path forward should be.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\nAG Bill Barr: Mueller\u2019s letter criticizing his summary of report \u2018a bit snitty\u2019\n\nOther polling bites\n\nTrump approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 41.8 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.1 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -11.3 points). At this time last week, 41.5 percent approved and 53.1 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -11.6 points).

The Lady Techsters had already compiled a 109-9 record over the previous three seasons, winning the 1981 AIAW Championship (the precursor to the women\u2019s tourney) with a perfect 34-0 record. Led by Wade Trophy winner Pam Kelly, the team put the finishing touches on another title in 1982 by defeating Cheyney and legendary coach C. Vivian Stringer in the final. It was the first of two NCAA championships Louisiana Tech would win in the 1980s and started a run of seven No. 1 seeds across nine NCAA tournaments.\n\nLouisiana Tech was the UConn of the women\u2019s NCAA tourney\u2019s early era. But aside from a few more strong seasons in the 1990s, it\u2019s been downhill since. The Lady Techsters haven\u2019t made the NCAA field since 2011 \u2014 at 14-14 this season, they aren\u2019t likely to end that drought soon \u2014 and they haven\u2019t had an All-American since Tamicha Jackson in 2000.\n\nLouisiana Tech isn\u2019t alone among once-great programs whose talent pipelines have dried up. A number of teams that were the titans of the early NCAA tournament have struggled in recent decades. And in their place, a new ruling class of schools has emerged to become the defining programs of the modern age. In a championship as young as the women\u2019s tournament, it\u2019s been fascinating to watch the rise and fall of programs that, not very long ago, were in a very different place.\n\nTo visualize the progress of women\u2019s programs in the absence of game-level data, such as our Elo ratings, we can use NCAA Tournament seeds as a proxy for team strength over time. This doesn\u2019t explicitly factor in how a team performs in the tournament itself, but it does measure the general quality of a team\u2019s entire season \u2014 plus, higher seeds tend to win more in the tournament anyway . To measure this, we awarded \u201cseed points\u201d in proportion to a given seed number\u2019s expected wins in the tournament, calibrated to a 100-point scale where the No. 1 seed gets 100 points, No. 2 gets 70 points, and so forth.\n\nA more basic scoring system might assign 16 points to a No. 1 seed, 15 to a No. 2, etc., all the way down to 1 point for a 16 seed. But that would understate the power of a high seed: Instead of being only twice as valuable as, say, a 9 seed, a No. 1 seed wins about seven times as many games during the average tournament.\n\nAveraging those seed-based point totals over all the women\u2019s tournaments held since 1982, here are the top overall programs of the entire NCAA tourney era.\n\nWhich women\u2019s programs have been most successful during the NCAA tournament era? Seed points* in NCAA tournaments held for women\u2019s programs, by decade and overall since 1982 Seed Points Per Tournament, by decade School 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s Overall 1 Tennessee 73.7 95.4 87.4 68.9 82.1 2 UConn 2.2 72.0 89.4 100.0 68.4 3 Stanford 15.7 83.3 51.1 77.4 58.5 4 Duke 2.7 23.3 89.4 55.3 44.5 5 Georgia 65.0 45.7 42.9 24.6 44.0 6 Louisiana Tech 92.6 60.1 27.1 1.5 44.0 7 Texas 76.4 29.8 35.0 35.1 42.6 8 Maryland 43.5 20.8 38.6 50.4 37.7 9 North Carolina 25.4 38.3 62.5 20.2 37.7 10 Notre Dame 0.0 10.9 35.9 93.4 35.4 11 Penn St. 31.0 48.7 32.3 19.6 33.4 12 Ohio St. 46.1 15.5 36.2 33.8 32.1 13 Purdue 4.2 50.1 47.4 17.5 31.5 14 Baylor 0.0 0.0 41.1 83.7 31.5 15 Virginia 40.8 58.4 19.3 4.9 31.0 16 Vanderbilt 11.1 46.9 48.5 10.5 30.8 17 LSU 25.2 16.8 60.0 17.4 30.5 18 Old Dominion 57.2 42.5 17.1 0.0 28.5 19 Iowa 30.1 43.1 11.2 20.0 26.0 20 NC State 41.3 26.6 19.5 12.9 24.6 *Seed points award a score on a 100-point scale; a No. 1 seed gets 100 points, while the rest descend in proportion to the seed\u2019s expected wins during the tournament. Source: NCAA\n\nSome teams, such as Tennessee, have been relatively consistent throughout the NCAA era. Although the Lady Vols were at their best under coach Pat Summitt during the 1990s, ranking first among all programs in seed points per tournament, they were also the third-best program of the 2000s according to our metric, fourth-best of the 1980s and even fifth-best of the 2010s, though the past few years haven\u2019t been as strong by Tennessee standards. (The Vols probably won\u2019t be adding to their tally this season, either: Tennessee is currently 18-11 and ranks 63rd in the RPI ratings, making it a bubble team at best for this year\u2019s bracket.)\n\nMaryland and North Carolina have also been relatively good throughout the history of the women\u2019s tournament. But more striking on the list above is how many programs followed the Louisiana Tech path \u2014 dominating the early days of the tourney, only to drop off the face of the Earth later. In addition to the Lady Techsters, three other programs \u2014 Long Beach State, Southern Cal and Old Dominion \u2014 have seen the biggest drop-off in seed points per tournament between the tournament\u2019s first two decades and its two most recent.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, we have the programs that started slow and picked up steam into the present day. And as hard as it is to believe now, Connecticut wasn\u2019t always the unstoppable force we see today. The Huskies didn\u2019t make their first NCAA tournament appearance until 1989 and didn\u2019t win a championship before 1995. Now it\u2019s shocking news when UConn might not be a No. 1 seed, and it\u2019s currently riding a streak of 11 straight Final Four berths. According to our metric, no team\u2019s fortunes have improved more between the NCAA tourney\u2019s early period in the 1980s and the current era than the Huskies\u2019.\n\nOther stunning out-of-nowhere success stories include current No. 1 Baylor, which made its first NCAA tournament in 2001(!); defending champion Notre Dame, which didn\u2019t win an NCAA tournament game until 1996; and Duke, which \u2014 despite the success of its men\u2019s team \u2014 failed to make much noise on the women\u2019s side until the late 1990s/early 2000s. With the exception of the Blue Devils (who at 14-14 are unlikely to make the tournament), all of these programs have continued to be great this season. In fact, many more of today\u2019s top teams \u2014 such as Louisville, Mississippi State and South Carolina \u2014 all emerged from humble results during the 1980s and \u201890s.\n\nMost sports see early champions maintain some sort of strong presence into modern times, like the New York Yankees in baseball and Boston Celtics in basketball. So it\u2019s surprising that this many of the most dominant teams of the early women\u2019s tourney have vanished from the competitive landscape. It\u2019s not impossible to imagine Louisiana Tech returning to its former glory someday, but for now the Lady Techsters\u2019 success is a memory fading quickly into ancient history.\n\nSara Ziegler contributed research.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/louisiana-tech-was-the-uconn-of-the-80s/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}]}, "fivethirtyeight_economics": {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/economics/", "articles": [{"title": "White Neighborhoods Have More Access To COVID-19 Testing Sites", "text": "When the coronavirus outbreak threatened to rock Philadelphia\u2019s predominantly Black neighborhoods, Dr. Ala Stanford knew that access to COVID-19 tests was going to be a problem.\n\nSo she rented a van, loaded it up and headed to the areas of the city where residents needed tests the most.

Only a small share were in majority-Black neighborhoods, and the bar for actually getting a test was high.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been to locations that are predominantly African American where everyone had insurance and they couldn\u2019t get tested,\u201d said Stanford, referring to the often strict requirements providers had of those seeking tests as the outbreak began, such as doctor referrals, appointments and symptoms consistent with infection.\n\nStanford, a pediatric surgeon, quickly assembled a group of doctors and volunteers called the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium to help meet the challenge of testing the city\u2019s underserved residents. Together, the group has issued Philadelphia\u2019s residents more than 7,000 tests. But even with the intervention of medical professionals like Stanford stepping in to meet the rising demand, many communities of color across the country still face a dire situation in terms of getting a COVID-19 test.\n\nWith nearly 4 million coronavirus cases across the United States and hospitalizations surging in different parts of the country, there continues to be a growing demand for tests. Today, Americans routinely wait for hours to get an exam \u2014 if they can get one at all. Access is not available equally nationwide. Simply put, where Americans live and how much income they earn can still determine the ease with which they get a COVID-19 test.\n\nAccording to a new, extensive review of testing sites by ABC News, FiveThirtyEight and ABC-owned television stations, sites in communities of color in many major cities face higher demand than sites in whiter or wealthier areas in those same cities. The result of this disparity is clear: People of color, especially Black and Hispanic people, are more likely to experience longer wait times and understaffed testing centers.\n\nThis nationwide review is one of the first to look at testing site locations coast to coast, in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., using data provided by the health care navigation company Castlight Health (the same data that Google Maps uses to surface COVID-19 testing sites). An assessment of city and state health department websites also revealed, over and over, fewer testing sites in areas primarily inhabited by racial minorities.\n\nImportantly, our analysis does not factor in the capacity of testing sites, which can vary from just 50 tests at one site to 2,000 at another, meaning that one site might be equipped to serve a larger number of people than another site. Instead, it looks at the potential demand for each site based on the number of people and sites nearby. The data we used is also less likely to reflect tests done in private physicians\u2019 offices than federally-funded community sites, local government-run mobile pop-up sites, urgent care clinics and hospitals. Additionally, this analysis doesn\u2019t take into account other factors that could determine testing accessibility, such as staffing and wait times, as well as other restrictions on testing like appointment or insurance requirements.\n\nWhen the outbreak began, testing posed the most immediate challenge to states, as a shortage of supplies, testing kits and processing backlogs created capacity problems. Since then, states have vastly increased their bandwidth to perform tests, but even now, experts from the Harvard Global Health Institute say daily testing needs to nearly double to help mitigate the pandemic. And states and cities are still struggling to determine how to allocate testing resources and where to place testing centers.\n\nThe Trump administration struggled early on in the pandemic to expand testing nationwide. Reliant on off-shore manufacturing that limited access to supplies like swabs and reagents, and armed with little data about who was getting sick and where, Trump\u2019s political appointees quickly embraced that the federal government\u2019s job would be mostly managing the logistics of testing such as supplies and distribution of state funds, as opposed to overseeing the coordination of state testing plans.\n\nBut critics say that strategy left many states scrambling to meet the rising demand that health experts say will only grow more urgent in the fall, when students return and flu season starts.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recently released a comprehensive strategy to address the disparate access to COVID-19 testing, including expanding testing at federally qualified health centers as well as supporting public-private partnerships that establish testing at retail pharmacy companies to accelerate testing within vulnerable populations. CVS and Walgreens \u2014 two of the retail pharmacies listed in the HHS plan \u2014 both said in statements to ABC News that more than half of their store locations issuing COVID-19 tests are now located in areas most in need, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s social vulnerability index.\n\nWHAT OUR ANALYSIS FOUND\n\nThe novel coronavirus itself does not distinguish between Black and white Americans. But virtually every other aspect of U.S. society does, including the nation\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nOur analysis revealed that, in many cities, testing sites in and near predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are likely to serve far more patients than those near predominantly white areas.\n\nA similar disparity exists between richer and poorer neighborhoods, our analysis showed: Testing resources were more scarce in poorer areas, with fewer sites per person and sites located farther away. And the disparity could be even greater in real life, considering wealthier people could also get tested by private practitioners who are less likely to be reflected in our analysis.\n\nKevin Ahmaad Jenkins, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics who has been researching the impact of COVID-19 testing center availability on communities of color, told ABC News and FiveThirtyEight that his team found that testing sites serving minority communities in big cities are fewer in number, have longer lines and often run out of tests. The impact of such disparities, he said, is evident in the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate effect on people of color.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just as clear as George Floyd\u2019s video. These numbers are right in front us: We are dying at disproportionate rates,\u201d he said.\n\nTo better understand the extent of this problem, we looked for cities whose broader \u201curbanized area\u201d had at least 1 million residents. (\u201cUrbanized area\u201d is a census designation for cities and the densely populated areas immediately surrounding them.) We then calculated the potential level of demand at each testing site in that area, based on the number of people living nearby and additional sites in the area.\n\nWe assumed that people would want to get tested at nearby sites, so we compared the number of patients a site would serve if the population of each census block group tried to visit sites that were close to them. This value, which we will refer to as potential patient demand, reflects how many people live near a given site and how many other options those people have.\n\nThe disparities we found varied in severity across the country. In some major urbanized areas, they\u2019re small or nonexistent. But in others \u2014 from Dallas to Miami to San Diego and many places in between \u2014 majority-Black and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods faced far more competition for COVID-19 testing than their white neighbors. Disparities were also seen in some predominantly Asian or Pacific Islander communities, such as those in Washington, D.C., Minneapolis and Riverside, Calif., but they weren\u2019t as widespread as those among Black and Hispanic communities.\n\nAnd our calculation of potential demand for testing at some sites in those underserved neighborhoods is likely an underestimation: Based on our reporting, many of the testing sites in those neighborhoods are government-funded community sites. These sites are set up to close the gaps in testing access in different communities, but they tend to be very popular among people from all across the county or urban area because they are often free and don\u2019t require an appointment.\n\nWe used data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2014-18 American Community Survey five-year estimates to figure out if, within urbanized areas, block groups that were majority Black or majority Hispanic were more likely to be close to sites with higher potential patient demand than majority-white block groups. To compare neighborhoods, we created a measure that we call potential community need, which is an average of the potential demand at nearby test sites. We also examined how block groups with a median income in the top 25 percent compared to those with median incomes in the bottom 25 percent.\n\nCastlight\u2019s set of testing site locations is among the most comprehensive data available, but compiling every testing location in the nation is a massive undertaking, as sites are constantly opening, closing and moving. Given that, the data set is likely missing some testing sites. Additionally, our analysis is based on testing site data as of June 18, so many new sites have been added nationwide since then \u2014 and others have likely closed or moved. We conducted separate analyses using a different source of testing site locations and examined other testing-related data to corroborate our findings.\n\nWe\u2019ve highlighted some of the cities with the most emblematic trends below. While we\u2019re confident in the trends we\u2019re presenting, we\u2019d encourage you to think of them more as estimates (akin to a fire marshal\u2019s approximation of the size of a crowd at a political rally) than exact measurements (such as a baseball player\u2019s batting average). For more detail on our methodology, and some of the limitations in the data and thus this analysis, see here.\n\nHowever, this analysis still provides a vivid snapshot of the hurdles, complications and shortfalls in American efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 this summer, a time when increased testing capacity in minority and low-income areas could have slowed the disease \u2014 a point widely acknowledged by public health experts.\n\n\u201cTesting site distribution and capacity is a direct reflection of the inequalities in our existing health care system,\u201d said John Brownstein, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard Medical School whose team of researchers at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Computational Epidemiology Lab also looked into the health care disparities underlying geographic access to testing. \u201cThe lack of access for those most vulnerable to infections will only serve to intensify the impact of this pandemic.\u201d\n\nTEXAS\n\nKenneth Hamilton, 31, had been waiting for four hours in the line to take a COVID-19 test at Houston\u2019s NRG Stadium.\n\nEventually, after spotting several people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, Hamilton \u2014 a small business owner and father of seven \u2014 decided that continuing to wait wasn\u2019t worth the risk of being exposed to coronavirus in the line itself. So he left, and looked for other testing options in his neighborhood.\n\nBut as a Black resident of Houston\u2019s Third Ward, the line Hamilton left was, at the time, his only nearby option. Three months after he first sought a test, he says there are considerably more testing centers in his neighborhood.\n\n\u201cOne of the schools that my kids go to, and one of the schools close by in the neighborhood, and a couple of churches now have them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey ramped up, to an extent.\u201d\n\nThe Houston urbanized area is just as diverse as many other major Texas metropolitan areas, but the city\u2019s initial plans to spread testing centers out equally across its neighborhoods while still operating at capacity helped to reduce site demand. As a result, the community demands of various neighborhoods were fairly equal. ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis showed that, on average, predominantly Black Houston neighborhoods faced similar levels of potential need as white neighborhoods. Hispanic neighborhoods had slightly higher potential community need than white neighborhoods, but not by much.\n\nBut the disparities are still clearly visible in the San Antonio and Dallas areas.\n\nSAN ANTONIO\n\nIn the San Antonio urbanized area, testing sites in poorer, majority-Black and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods in the south, east and west are estimated to have to serve far more people than sites in more affluent, whiter neighborhoods in the north, resulting in a disparity in potential community need.\n\nAccording to our analysis, of the roughly 45 sites that were actively testing in San Antonio in mid-June, several sites with the lowest potential patient demand were concentrated in the northern neighborhoods of Stone Oak and The Dominion, as well as the areas surrounding Friedrich Wilderness Park, which are all majority-white communities that boast median household incomes ranging from around $100,000 to $150,000.\n\nIn comparison, many of the busiest sites are scattered in San Antonio\u2019s more densely populated downtown, where the median income ranged from just $15,000 to about $40,000.\n\nThroughout the San Antonio urbanized area, predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods had an average potential community need twice as large as white neighborhoods; the disparity in between majority-Black and majority-white neighborhoods was even larger.\n\nExperts say that the disparity can be attributed to a long-standing gap in the health care system and an unequal distribution of health care facilities in the San Antonio area, which is one of the most economically segregated cities in the country.\n\nRecognizing testing disparities in different communities, the city identified underserved neighborhoods based on its equity matrix, and put together three cost-free pop-up sites that rotate around different parts of the city every week, according to its health department.\n\nNot only are government sites falling short of their ability to meet the public need for tests, but they themselves have become part of the disparity by concentrating demand even as they seek to address it in underserved neighborhoods. San Antonio\u2019s walk-up sites do not require a doctor\u2019s referral and, as a result, have become massively popular among those who do not otherwise have access to testing.\n\nIn late June, Jennifer Herriott, the deputy director of the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District, told us that people have lined up hours before these pop-up sites even open and that one time they had to turn down 275 people after running out of tests.\n\nHerriott said that as the demand for testing spiked, with cases and hospitalization rates across the state setting new records on an almost daily basis, the city and the county have been working to ramp up testing capacity. The pop-up sites that used to run only three days a week now operate six days a week, and each site\u2019s capacity has been increased from about 150-200 tests per day to 350.\n\nStill, the long lines remain in some places, and sites continue to run out of tests.\n\n\u201cPublic health and our partnership with San Antonio Fire [Department] has consistently had its eye on making sure that we\u2019re serving our Black and brown communities,\u201d Herriott said. \u201cAs our needs increase here, we\u2019ve increased free testing and those walk-ups and the Freeman drive-thru so we make sure that communities that might not be able to access testing are able to access testing.\u201d\n\nDALLAS\n\nDallas County and Tarrant County, two counties of nearly 4.7 million people that cover much of the Dallas urbanized area, have together reported over 64,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus so far. Our data showed that in early summer, the testing infrastructure of the Dallas urbanized area \u2014 which encompasses the cities of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington \u2014 resembled that of San Antonio: Local and state providers, as well as private hospitals, favored people living in whiter and wealthier parts of the county, towards the north, more than those living in the less affluent areas in the south.\n\nAcross the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington urbanized area, our analysis found that majority-Black neighborhoods had a potential community need 46 percent higher than majority-white neighborhoods; majority-Hispanic neighborhoods had a potential need 24 percent higher.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a compounding problem beyond just where the sites are,\u201d said Judge Clay Jenkins, the chief elected official in Dallas County. \u201cThe people that tend to have insurance are in the north and those that tend to not have insurance are in the south. We\u2019ve planned to put the majority of our testing in places where there\u2019s high uninsured.\u201d\n\nTake the University Park neighborhood of Dallas, where the median household income is $214,000 and almost 90 percent of the residents are white. It has at least five testing sites around the neighborhood, according to Castlight data. Appointments are required at most of them, per Castlight, which helps organize the speed at which people are able to get tested every day (walk-in testing centers tend to have longer lines).\n\nIt\u2019s a vastly different situation in Lancaster in southeast Dallas County, which has about 15,000 more residents than University Park but where Black people make up 69 percent of the population and the median household income is $53,000. Residents hoping to get a coronavirus test in the Lancaster area had to travel at least seven miles to the nearest drive-thru testing center until recently, when a nearby Walmart Supercenter opened up a drive-thru site.\n\nTo address the disparities, the city of Dallas asked the private sector to step up its support in the areas of the city most in need of more testing.\n\n\u201cA lot of the private providers are set up in northern Dallas, and it does highlight the existing disparities in the city,\u201d said Tristan Hallman, a spokesman for Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson. \u201cIn response, we\u2019ve asked Walgreens, CVS, Kroger to locate their facilities in southern Dallas, and they\u2019ve done so.\u201d\n\nIndeed, public health experts said the issue of unequal access to testing is a direct result of long-standing decisions made by private-sector companies and entrepreneurs when selecting which neighborhoods to open new businesses in. And the disparity is exacerbated by the fact that underserved communities are less likely to have the health insurance or financial resources necessary to seek costly testing from private providers when community sites are not accessible.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly driven by systematic health care injustice and it\u2019s actually very clearly delineated in Dallas because of gentrification and all of the social aspects of our community,\u201d said Katelyn Jetelina, a professor at the UTHealth School of Public Health in Dallas. \u201cWe need to figure out how to supplement the cost so that families in south Dallas don\u2019t have to decide whether they\u2019re having dinner or have to go get a COVID test.\u201d\n\nEven as more testing sites have been set up in underserved communities, new coronavirus hot spots flared up over the summer as communities began to reopen; now, a lack of tests and long lines have created major problems all over the country.\n\nFurther south, along the border in Hidalgo, Texas, Isaac Garza waited 10 hours in line to get a coronavirus test after visiting several recently reopened restaurants he oversees. As he has diabetes, an underlying condition, he didn\u2019t want to take any chances, and was relieved when his test results came back negative.\n\nBut the limited testing options in his community creates problems for Garza\u2019s staff, too. Every day, Garza said, he receives calls from employees showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 who tell him that they might have to miss critical work hours to wait in line for a test.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been challenging to do business and just to live day in and day out with all this because you\u2019re trying to protect your family, you\u2019re trying to protect your employees,\u201d he said.\n\nPHILADELPHIA\n\nFuneral director John Price, 72, had just gotten a break after a long day picking up bodies of COVID-19 victims from local hospitals in June. So he thought it was the perfect time to get tested himself for the coronavirus.\n\nPrice pulled his car into a line of approximately 300 others waiting for a test at a church parking lot on Cheltenham Avenue in North Philadelphia. Two hours in, he started getting calls from clients who had just lost loved ones to COVID-19. Another hour into his attempt to get a test, Price realized that he just couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\n\n\u201cI had to pull out of the line, because I had people who were calling me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was probably going to be another two or three hours before they got to me. If they got to me.\u201d\n\nHe went another week without getting a COVID-19 test until he stumbled upon a walk-in testing site organized by Dr. Ala Stanford\u2019s Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, which was offering the tests for free.\n\n\u201cA lot of people weren\u2019t notified of how they can actually get testing,\u201d said Price, recalling confusion amongst residents when the outbreak first began in the predominantly Black neighborhood of West Powelton, where his funeral home is based. \u201cIt was more like word of mouth, \u2018Oh this organization is doing it today over here, or so-and-so is doing it today over there.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven today, as the coronavirus crisis intensifies nationally, predominantly Black neighborhoods in the Philadelphia urbanized area, which extends into New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, have fewer testing centers than their wealthier and whiter counterparts.\n\nOther researchers, conducting independent analyses of other data, observed the same phenomenon we did regarding the demands placed on testing sites in majority-white and majority-Black neighborhoods at the city level, despite the fact that Black Philadelphians make up a plurality of COVID-19 test recipients in the city.\n\nDrawing on his own study of access to COVID-19 tests in various Philadelphia neighborhoods, which he has been tracking since the outbreak began, Drexel University epidemiologist Dr. Usama Bilal found that testing disparities are often a product of existing systemic inequalities. Rates of testing, he said, were lower in poorer areas and areas with higher proportions of residents who are racial minorities. Testing access improved throughout the city in April and May, Bilal found, but as cases start to resurface and the demand for tests rises, he worries the city will backslide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been observing that testing access is going the wrong way again,\u201d he said. \u201cTesting is becoming more concentrated in wealthier areas in Philadelphia, and we have observed a similar pattern in Chicago and New York.\u201d\n\nA Philadelphia public health department spokesman denied that testing is increasingly inaccessible to racial minorities and said that the city has been focused on expanding resources in underserved communities, citing services like the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, which recently received city funding to conduct free coronavirus tests.\n\nBut Stanford, the surgeon who heads the consortium, said she worried that as the demand for testing increases nationwide, the share of tests she will be able to offer free of charge will fall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here in the sun, in the rain, doing whatever we can do in a mobile unit begging for supplies from everywhere else in the United States, waiting 10 days to get our results back,\u201d she said. \u201cBut yet, in some of the best hospitals in the nation you have an in-house test that the residents of this city do not uniformly have access to. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the city\u2019s public health department, Philadelphia has conducted more than 166,000 COVID-19 tests. Black residents account for 40 percent of the city\u2019s COVID-19 tests, more than any other racial group tested and about equal to the share of Philadelphia that is Black, per city data.\n\nBilal\u2019s research, however, now finds that in predominantly Black and highly populated areas like the Oxford Circle neighborhood of Philadelphia, where the median household income is $41,000, just 60.9 per every 1,000 people are now getting tested. Compare that to the more affluent and plurality white Center City neighborhoods, where testing rates are now 133 per every 1,000 people, according to Bilal.\n\n\u201cThe epidemic that we really need to control long term is social inequality,\u201d said Bilal as the coronavirus outbreak in Philadelphia first took hold. \u201cIt has many different intersecting axes. So there is racism: that is places, that is classism, that is gender discrimination, there are many, many things going on there.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Philadelphia area illustrates the extent to which disparities in coronavirus testing access grow out of systemic inequality in American society. Philadelphia is one of the poorest big cities in the nation, with about 25 percent of residents living below the poverty line. Bilal found that while the distribution of testing sites in Philadelphia has vastly improved from where it was at the beginning of the outbreak \u2014 with multiple options now available for residents in even the poorest areas \u2014 Black Americans in many low-income areas are still likely to find it difficult to get a COVID-19 test. Our analysis of the sites active in mid-June confirmed this.\n\nIn Kingsessing, a southwestern neighborhood that\u2019s around 80 percent Black, there\u2019s only one COVID-19 testing site, and that site has limited testing hours. Meanwhile, in the Center City area, there are several sites \u2014 some within a short walking distance of each other.\n\nAs is the situation in Philadelphia, many cities are now responding to calls to provide more resources to communities of color by increasing the number of pop-up sites to accommodate residents and ease the demand for more tests.\n\nSOUTH FLORIDA\n\nMartin Torres waited seven hours in line for a COVID-19 test at Hard Rock Stadium, an open-air venue best known as the home of the Miami Dolphins, while showing what he believed to be symptoms of the virus. When he finally reached the front, he was told he\u2019d get results back in five days.\n\nTwo weeks later, he is still waiting.\n\n\u201cI am kind of in a limbo waiting for when I can have a response for that,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nIn a statement responding to the demand in testing and the slower turnaround times, Quest Diagnostics, one of the major labs processing COVID-19 tests, said it will \u201ccontinue to ramp up capacity to reach 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests a day.\u201d\n\nFlorida, where the pandemic has recently spiked to nearly 370,000 confirmed cases, expanded testing capacity in response to problems surrounding testing access equity. But being a resident of a lower-income neighborhood still presents a challenge in terms of getting a COVID-19 test.\n\nThe South Florida region, which the census refers to as the Miami urbanized area, contains at least part of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, and has deep disparities in testing site availability in majority-Black, majority-Hispanic and majority-white neighborhoods, according to our analysis.\n\nThe neighborhoods included in the Miami urbanized area also have massive economic inequality, and disparities exist within different Hispanic communities. Yet the few testing sites in wealthy areas \u2014 such as Cooper City, a majority-white town located in Broward County just north of Miami-Dade \u2014 had a much smaller potential patient demand than sites in many of the more densely populated lower-income neighborhoods, many of which are majority Black or Hispanic.\n\nOn average, majority-Black areas had a potential community need 13 percent larger than majority-white census blocks. In majority-Hispanic areas, it was 29 percent larger, with the densely populated, predominantly Hispanic areas around South Miami showing a particularly high potential need.\n\nJust 10 miles south of Cooper City is Miami Gardens, a predominantly Black area in Miami-Dade County where the median household income is less than half that of Cooper City. If residents there want to get a test, they have to travel to Hard Rock Stadium and wait in a line that officials have advised could be as long as four hours in a summer heat that sometimes nears 100 degrees.\n\nThe long lines cause other problems, too. On most days at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site, it is not uncommon for testing to temporarily pause due to lightning in the area or because a car waiting in line breaks down due to mechanical issues.\n\n\u201cWe have seen cars run out of gas at some of the busier test sites, but we tell people that a little bit of planning and a lot of patience are required,\u201d said Mike Jachals, a state spokesman for several of the federally supported testing sites across the state.\n\nIn an emailed statement to ABC News and FiveThirtyEight, a state emergency management spokesman said Florida \u201cis continuing to increase COVID-19 testing daily.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said the county has made \u201ca concerted effort\u201d to put more testing facilities in lower-income communities throughout the county. As part of that effort, new pop-up sites at the Joseph Caleb Center in central Miami and Harris Field Park in south Miami-Dade, both located in predominantly Black or Hispanic areas, have been installed.\n\nIn Miramar, a city of about 140,000 just north of the Hard Rock Stadium, there\u2019s only one public COVID-19 testing center even though it happens to be the city with one of the largest percentages of Black people in Broward County. The city received the state funding necessary to open its first state-supported testing site just over a month ago, which local officials believe was far too late.\n\n\u201cInitially, I was very concerned, very upset,\u201d said Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam in response to a question about the lack of urgency in establishing testing facilities in the city. \u201cIt was very disappointing and upsetting, but I was actually happy once we did get the call notifying me that we would have the site and since that determination was made, we\u2019ve made the best of that site. It would have been ideal to have it up since the onset.\u201d\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA\n\nAfter touting a massive expansion of testing and stable case counts earlier this summer, California has in recent weeks been rolling back on its earlier promise of easy access to testing for every resident.\n\nCoronavirus hot spots in Southern California, in particular, are now putting back restrictions on community testing to prioritize symptomatic patients or those most at risk, such as nursing home residents and staff members.\n\nBased on ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis and reporting, communities of color and lower income-level neighborhoods in the San Diego and Los Angeles urbanized areas \u2014 where some of the biggest gaps in potential community need were seen between majority-white and majority-Black neighborhoods \u2014 are expected to suffer the most from the testing restrictions.\n\nAccording to our analysis of site locations in mid-June, in both the San Diego and Los Angeles areas, majority-Black neighborhoods were estimated to have around 30 percent higher potential need than majority-white neighborhoods.\n\nSAN DIEGO\n\nIn the San Diego urbanized area, much of which falls within the coastal section of San Diego County, many of the sites with lower potential patient demand are located in the predominantly white and wealthy neighborhoods along the northern part of the coast, while the sites expected to serve more people were all in the poorer, predominantly Black communities in the southern end of the city of San Diego.\n\nMost of the community sites in San Diego County, which tend to be busier than private sites, are by appointment, county Health and Human Services Agency spokesperson Tim McClain said, and with the recent spike in cases people have had to make appointments a week or more in advance.\n\nThat was the case for Holly Young, who lives in La Mesa, a suburb just east of the city of San Diego. Young, 60, said she sought testing earlier this month after she discovered that her son and his girlfriend had been in contact with a COVID-positive friend prior to seeing her.\n\nShe said her health care provider was unable to test her because she didn\u2019t show any symptoms, so she turned to a county testing site, for which she had to wait almost 10 days just to book an appointment and then drive an hour and 15 minutes to get to the site.\n\n\u201cI am in an essential industry, and part of my job is making the bank deposits, going to the post office and other routine tasks that were outside the business,\u201d said Young, who is a self-employed accountant with clients in retail. \u201cSo even though I was always masked, I still felt very vulnerable. I\u2019m overweight, take blood pressure medication and I smoked for 20 years, so I am not at all confident I would survive COVID-19.\u201d\n\nYoung was tested on July 11, and told she\u2019ll get her results in five to seven business days. But she went off a two-week self-quarantine last Thursday, meaning she had to return to work before getting her test results.\n\nThe disparity in access to tests hasn\u2019t been lost on Young, who said she is on Obamacare and does not get health care from her job: \u201cWe all know people who just call their doctor and get a test the next day. It shouldn\u2019t be this way.\u201d\n\nMcClain said San Diego County is exceeding state guidelines and offers widespread free and public testing access, but intends to do more to meet increasing public demand and reach deeper into at-risk communities. As of July 6, the county was surpassing the state goal of 4,950 daily tests \u2014 1.5 tests per day per every 1,000 residents \u2014 by 56 percent.\n\n\u201cAs tests became more widely available in spring, the county placed the greatest concentration of testing in our communities of diversity, and those near the border, and continues to bring more sites online,\u201d McClain said. \u201cTesting access is widely dispersed but we intend to make it more convenient with new locations, will add sites to address hotspots and will bring more no-appointment locations online.\u201d\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nThe Los Angeles area has also managed to at least narrow some of the disparities. The poorer urban centers of Los Angeles were estimated to have greater community need than the relatively wealthier suburbs outside the city, as well as in Pasadena, though to a lesser degree.\n\nSince California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an aggressive expansion of the statewide testing capacity back in late April, the state has also significantly ramped up testing in underserved communities, setting up close to 100 state-supported community sites in its communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods. According to our analysis, predominantly Asian communities actually had less potential demand than other groups, including white neighborhoods.\n\nThat expansion appears to have helped collapse testing disparities in the region, according to our analysis of testing data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\n\nAt the end of April, mostly white cities and communities in Los Angeles County had, on average, more than 1,200 tests completed per 100,000 people. That was more than 65 percent more completed tests than communities of color.\n\nAfter Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced free COVID-19 testing for everyone in the county and expanded testing operations, the number of tests administered tripled.\n\nA month later, the racial testing gap had shrunk to just 24 percent between the most-white areas and the least white. About 6,200 tests per 100,000 people were completed in whiter areas and about 5,000 tests per 100,000 people in less white areas, according to the analysis of the city\u2019s testing data.\n\nThere was a similar pattern in wealthier and poorer areas. At the end of April, people were tested at a rate 60 percent higher in areas where the median household income was in the top quartile versus the bottom quartile. But by May 31, that gap had shrunk to just 13 percent.\n\nSince April, California has scaled up its statewide testing capacity from just 2,000 tests per day to more than 100,000 now, and has completed nearly 4.8 million tests since the pandemic began, the state\u2019s health department spokesperson told ABC News and FiveThirtyEight.\n\nAs cases and hospitalizations hit new records in the past couple weeks, however, the state is again struggling with testing capacity. The governor last week issued a new advisory to hospitals and labs, asking them to prioritize testing turnaround for individuals who are most at risk of spreading the virus to others, including those in nursing homes and congregate living settings.\n\nThe Castlight data analysis has helped shed light on the racial, ethnic and income disparities in the allocation of COVID-19 testing resources, and ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s reporting shows how gaps created by systemic inequity in the health care system continue to persist even as states, cities and counties step up efforts to address them.\n\nAs cases rise and states across the country begin to face testing constraints, more local governments and private providers say they are considering going back to prioritizing testing access to symptomatic patients and those most at risk. In some places, such as Sacramento, Calif., and Omaha, Neb., testing sites are even closing because of supply shortages. This is expected to create additional strain on testing for underserved communities as state or county-sponsored public sites and labs further limit testing access.\n\n\u201cOur response to COVID is a reflection of the existing biases we have in our healthcare system,\u201d said John Brownstein, the epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWhile governments are trying to close the gap, we still have a long way to go to make sure Americans have equal access to testing resources.\u201d\n\nFor Dr. Ala Stanford and her colleagues at the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium in Philadelphia, the choice early on was clear: adjust to a new normal of life indoors, or move swiftly to implement testing on the streets of Philadelphia to combat a virus that was proving deadly to Black communities.\n\nStanford says she felt compelled to respond as she did because she knew that the same health care disparities she learned about in medical school, and as a practicing doctor, were still at play in Philadelphia during the coronavirus crisis \u2014 the city in which she\u2019s spent her entire life.\n\n\u201cI stopped and said to myself: I\u2019m a business owner in private practice, I have access, I can order these lab kits like anybody else, I know where the people are that are hurting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am not afraid to go there.\u201d\n\nABC News\u2019 Briana Stewart and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Rachael Dottle contributed reporting.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-neighborhoods-have-more-access-to-covid-19-testing-sites/", "author": ["Soo Rin Kim", "Matthew Vann", "Laura Bronner", "Grace Manthey"]}, {"title": "How We Analyzed 7,914 COVID-19 Testing Sites And Found Racial Disparities", "text": "For our story on the distribution of COVID-19 testing sites, we wanted to develop a measure of how busy coronavirus testing sites were likely to be.

One central point of tension: the $600-per-week supplemental unemployment insurance benefit that was enacted in March as part of the CARES Act and is set to expire on July 31.\n\nDemocrats have proposed extending the payment until jobless rates in states fall below a certain threshold. Republicans, meanwhile, are leery of continuing the full payments, saying they will discourage people from returning to work. And it\u2019s true that research has shown that many workers are making more money on the beefed-up benefits than they would be at their old jobs.\n\nBut in the latest installment of our regular survey of quantitative macroeconomic economists, conducted in partnership with the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, the 33 economists in our study collectively thought there was a 59 percent chance that either keeping the payment steady or increasing it to above $600 per week would be most beneficial to the economy. They said there was about a 33 percent chance that reducing the weekly payment to less than $600 would most benefit the economy, and only a 7 percent chance that letting the program completely lapse would be most beneficial. This makes sense considering that another recent IGM survey found that most economists blamed high unemployment on companies that weren\u2019t hiring \u2014 not on people choosing not to work because of unemployment payments.\n\nJonathan Wright, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University who has been consulting with FiveThirtyEight on the design of the survey, pointed out that some extension of unemployment insurance is important because many workers are still out of a job. States can continue to offer benefits regardless of what the federal government does, but those don\u2019t last forever, either \u2014 and some states are less generous than others.\n\nHow should Congress handle unemployment insurance? Likelihood that each federal policy choice would most benefit the entire economy over the rest of 2020, according to economists Option Probability Keep the weekly payment at $600 37% Reduce the weekly payment to less than $600 33 Increase the weekly payment to more than $600 22 Allow federal pandemic unemployment insurance to completely lapse 7 The survey of 33 economists was conducted July 17-20. Source: FIVETHIRTYEIGHT/IGM COVID-19 ECONOMIC SURVEY\n\nOf course, the perspectives on Congress\u2019s response are nuanced, and many of the economists think the benefits should ideally be phased out as the economy improves, assuming there are no logistical hurdles. When we drilled into some of the ways that federal policymakers could aid jobless workers, the experts thought there was a 37 percent chance that the best strategy would be to continue paying jobless workers $600 weekly for now but peg federal unemployment benefits to key economic indicators so they become gradually less generous as the economy improves. They said there was a 26 percent chance it would benefit the economy more if the workers were paid less than $600 per week for a fixed period of time, and a 22 percent probability that it would be better to continue paying jobless workers $600 a week even if it meant some would make more than they did while working.\n\nDeborah Lucas, an economist at MIT, said she would opt for temporarily leaving the weekly payment at $600, or even increasing it a bit, although she said the payments should ramp down if the economy improved enough. \u201cThe fact that a considerable number of people are making more this way than when they were working seems like a good thing,\u201d she said, adding that this will only be true for low earners, who might otherwise feel pressure to take jobs that would endanger their health. \u201cIn effect, it enhances social insurance protections and is a step towards universal basic income, both policies I think would improve social welfare even in the absence of a pandemic.\u201d\n\nNot all of the economists were a fan of expanding or maintaining the $600 weekly payment, though. Annette Vissing-J\u00f8rgensen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said it was fundamentally unfair that some essential workers were making less money than nonessential workers who were out of a job. She added that while she\u2019s concerned overall about making it more financially attractive for workers to stay home from their jobs, particularly if hiring starts to pick up again, there \u201ccould be a role for continuing some level of extra benefits\u201d in states that are less generous. Others noted that while the extra payment made sense as a short-term stimulus measure, economists might approach the long-term consequences of such a generous supplement differently.\n\nStill, it was notable that the least popular response to the question above was an alternative to the $600-per-week payment that\u2019s been floated by some Republicans, who have proposed a \u201cback to work bonus\u201d for people who return to their jobs instead of continuing to supplement workers\u2019 unemployment benefits. Economists thought there was only a 16 percent chance this would do the most to benefit the economy.\n\n\u201cContinued unemployment support has the twin benefits of alleviating poverty for jobless workers and sustaining consumer demand in the economy,\u201d said Allan Timmermann, professor of finance and economics at the University of California, San Diego. Timmermann has also been consulting with us on the survey. \u201c[It] is viewed as a highly effective tool to prevent the economy from stalling.\u201d\n\nAlong similar lines, we asked economists how they would allocate $1 trillion in a hypothetical COVID-19 stimulus package if they wanted to do the most good for the entire economy (with the assumption that the health crisis itself would be addressed with a separate bill). The economists ranked their top three priorities and gave unemployment insurance the highest share of No. 1 responses. But though that benefit was in the top three of priorities for a majority of the experts, at 67 percent, it didn\u2019t see the highest share of overall top-three responses. By that measure, the clear priority according to economists was funding state and local governments \u2014 which is consistent with a previous survey in which they thought one of the most likely causes of economic disaster would be an unwillingness to bail out those governments. In this week\u2019s survey, 85 percent of respondents thought that should be among lawmakers\u2019 top three priorities, and 36 percent said it should be No. 1.\n\nWhat should be the priorities of a federal stimulus?

So cushioning states and localities could do a lot to support the economy, he said.\n\nOther areas of focus that frequently came up among the economists\u2019 top three priorities were funding for small businesses (48 percent) and public K-12 schools (45 percent) and another round of individual stimulus checks (36 percent). None of our economists, however, thought funding either large corporations or colleges and other institutions of higher learning was a priority.\n\nIn addition to our usual questions about gross domestic product in the second and fourth quarters, we asked the economists to forecast third-quarter real GDP growth in this installment of the survey. The results shed some light on just how much the prospect of a true \u201csecond wave\u201d of coronavirus in the winter could slow down economic growth.\n\nOn average, economists thought real GDP in the second quarter of 2020 \u2014 which ended June 30, with an advance GDP estimate set to be released later this month \u2014 declined by an annualized rate of 27 percent compared with the first quarter. They also thought real GDP would grow by about 8 percentage points quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter, with an upper-bound estimate of 17 percent and little chance of negative growth again. But their forecasts looked bleaker for the fourth quarter, with a median forecast of 3 percent growth, a 90th-percentile forecast of 9 percent and a 10th-percentile forecast in the red again (at -3 percent) \u2014 all more pessimistic than in the third quarter.\n\nSome of that reflects the increased economic activity of the summer (relative to the early spring), even with the virus circulating around the country; the likelihood of some kind of third-quarter bounce back was high, given how bad economists think second-quarter GDP will end up. But the forecast also speaks to the uncertain course that the virus \u2014 and therefore, the economy \u2014 might take over the rest of 2020.\n\nRobert Barbera, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said part of the problem in forecasting quarterly shifts is that month-to-month change can be so extreme. His forecast for the third quarter was less optimistic because he expected most of the initial bounce back to happen in May and June, which are both part of the second quarter. The third quarter might see an uptick in August and September and look quite a bit better than the second quarter, he said, but that\u2019s partially because the second quarter was so bad. Predicting the fourth quarter is even more difficult \u2014 in part because a bounce back in the economy is so dependent on Americans\u2019 willingness to resume ordinary life.\n\nHowever the course of the recession plays out, our economists think America could be due for a massive wave of personal bankruptcies in the second half of the year. During the first half of 2020, total bankruptcy filings \u2014 the vast majority of which were by individuals \u2014 were actually down 23 percent relative to the first half of 2019, according to court data from Epiq AACER. But don\u2019t be fooled: That was almost certainly because of the heavy use of grace periods and extensions by creditors, which will eventually expire (if they haven\u2019t already). In our survey, 67 percent of economists thought total filings would increase significantly in the second half of 2020 relative to the second half of 2019; only 6 percent thought they would see the same kind of year-over-year decrease in the second half of 2020 that they saw in the first half.\n\nTaken as a whole, the economic picture painted by this week\u2019s survey is no brighter than in previous installments. The panel\u2019s predictions for future GDP have scarcely budged over the past two weeks, and the experts remain wary that whatever gains the economy is making over the summer could be wiped out by the virus before year\u2019s end. But they also clearly think Congress has a few tools at its disposal to avoid making the recovery harder than it needs to be. The big question is \u2014 will policymakers use them?", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/economists-think-congress-should-keep-paying-unemployed-workers-600-a-week-or-even-more/", "author": ["Neil Paine", "Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "At Long Last, Baseball\u2019s (Almost) Back", "text": "We start with our preview of the 2020 MLB season.

Our model favors the Houston Astros and the New York Yankees in the American League (with Sara\u2019s beloved Minnesota Twins close behind), and the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Washington Nationals lead the National League. While we\u2019ve lost the luxury of a long season, in which a single game doesn\u2019t matter quite so much, we are excited by how close the race for the playoffs might be all the way to the end. At least on paper, the Dodgers are the favorites, with a 20 percent chance to win the World Series, and we\u2019re all excited to see what kind of a difference Mookie Betts will make for them. But the potential for something wild to happen is also high, and it would only take a string of eight or nine wins to boost a team that looks bad now into playoff contention. Everyone remains skeptical of the Mets\u2019 chances, though, so at least we still have some constants.\n\nNext, we welcome FiveThirtyEight contributor Bria Felicien to take us through the highs and lows of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League Challenge Cup. The quarterfinals of the tournament saw a number of upsets, including the absolutely loaded North Carolina Courage being denied by the Portland Thorns and their stacked bench of incredible goalies. In fact, the goalkeepers have really been the stars of the tournament, with keepers like Kailen Sheridan, Jane Campbell and Britt Eckerstrom keeping pace with the USWNT\u2019s starter, Alyssa Naeher. Now that the Courage have been eliminated, Bria is just rooting for some goals and some drama. But the success of the Challenge Cup \u2014 not to mention the just-announced addition of a Los Angeles-based team \u2014 pretty much ensures that the league will serve up more of both.\n\nFinally, FiveThirtyEight senior visual journalist Anna Wiederkehr joins to explore the wild world of Fastest Known Time trail running \u2014 which is exactly what it sounds like.

But The Astros And Yankees Are Favorites In The American League \u2026 Again.\n\nWhen Major League Baseball finally starts its 2020 season on July 23, it will be a very different kind of campaign than any we\u2019ve seen in our lifetimes. Not only will it be much shorter than usual (60 games per team instead of 162) and feature a strange mix of division and interleague matchups, but it comes against the backdrop of a pandemic that continues to ravage the nation, which has caused players to question the wisdom of playing \u2014 or opt out of the season entirely.\n\nAnd yet, MLB is back \u2014 and so are our predictions. To help make sense of the favorites and dark horses in this strange mini-season, we plugged the shortened schedule into our forecast model and simulated it 100,000 times, tracking each team\u2019s expected record and its odds of winning the division or the World Series. Here\u2019s what our model thinks of the 2020 American League:\n\nHow Elo is forecasting the AL East race Avg. Simulated Season Chance to\u2026 Team Elo Rating Wins Losses Run Diff.

Sources: Baseball prospectus, Fangraphs, Clay Davenport\n\nLast year\u2019s AL East was supposed to see a tight race between the defending champs in Boston and their bitterest of rivals in the Bronx. Instead, the New York Yankees overcame a rash of injuries to pull away for the division crown in the second half \u2014 and our model thinks the Bombers are clear East favorites again in 2020. New York added ace Gerrit Cole via free agency, which shores up a rotation that ranked just 16th in total wins above replacement, but an even bigger factor might be improved health for a club that saw players spend 3,192 total days on the injured list in 2019 \u2014 36 percent more than any other team. If Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Gary Sanchez, Aaron Hicks and Miguel Andujar can stay intact over the short schedule, the Yankees will be a major championship threat.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays gave New York a good fight early last season and were also a thorn in the Houston Astros\u2019 side during the postseason. Maybe we should stop being surprised when they sneak up on much more expensive contenders every year! Losing Tommy Pham will hurt some in 2020, but this remains one of the best and most balanced teams in MLB (particularly if ace Blake Snell bounces back to his 2018 form). We think they\u2019ll be nearly as good as the Yankees, with a 56 percent shot at the playoffs.\n\n[Related: 60 Games Aren\u2019t Enough To Crown The Best MLB Team. But Neither Are 162 Games.]\n\nThat\u2019s better than our outlook for the Boston Red Sox, who had a terrible championship hangover last year and figure to take another step backward after firing manager Alex Cora in January, trading star right fielder Mookie Betts in February and watching ace Chris Sale undergo Tommy John surgery in March. Boston still has plenty of top-end talent (Xander Bogaerts, Rafael Devers, J.D. Martinez) but also enough flaws that a run at the Yankees and Rays looks unlikely.\n\nAnd the Red Sox could have competition from behind in the form of the Toronto Blue Jays, whose young core of Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Cavan Biggio and Bo Bichette should keep pushing the team\u2019s rebuild forward. After acquiring Hyun-Jin Ryu, Tanner Roark and Chase Anderson to improve what was a bottom-five rotation by WAR, don\u2019t be surprised if Toronto makes a run at .500.\n\nFinally, the Baltimore Orioles should bring up the rear for a fourth straight season. With Jonathan Villar and Dylan Bundy now gone, the biggest question might be whether they\u2019ll crack 20 wins in 60 games against the toughest schedule in baseball \u2014 we project them at just 21 wins for the season, the fewest of any team.\n\nHow Elo is forecasting the AL Central race Avg.

Sources: Baseball prospectus, Fangraphs, Clay Davenport\n\nThe Minnesota Twins were one of baseball\u2019s best stories in 2019, winning the AL Central as preseason underdogs and breaking the all-time single-season home run record in the process. Can they do it again? Well, we won\u2019t know about the home run part without more information about how \u201cjuiced\u201d the 2020 ball is. But in terms of division odds, Minnesota is still the favorite, if by a somewhat slim margin. The Twins didn\u2019t rest on their offseason laurels, adding the likes of Josh Donaldson, Kenta Maeda and Homer Bailey without losing too much of note. But they will also probably regress to the mean after an unusually healthy season that saw their record improve by a whopping 23 games. The question will be how well the offseason activity \u2014 and 2020\u2019s easiest schedule \u2014 helps counterbalance that regression.\n\nFighting to reclaim their old spot atop the division will be the Cleveland Indians, who let the Central slip away after three straight first-place finishes. The 2019 Indians weren\u2019t bad, but they weren\u2019t the elite club they\u2019d been just a few years earlier; despite a star-filled lineup, they scored fewer runs than the AL average and never mounted a big charge after briefly catching the Twins in August. Our model thinks the Tribe still has a 34 percent shot at the division crown, despite losing World Series-era mainstays Corey Kluber, Jason Kipnis and Danny Salazar over the offseason, but the window might be closing on the Francisco Lindor era soon.\n\n[Related: Our 2020 MLB Predictions]\n\nThe Chicago White Sox are a hot breakout pick heading into 2020, primarily because all the young talent they\u2019ve accumulated over the years has finally arrived. Third baseman Yoan Moncada and starter Lucas Giolito took big leaps last season, while left fielder Eloy Jim\u00e9nez and maybe even highly touted Cuban prospect Luis Robert seem poised to do the same this year. Add in offseason additions Yasmani Grandal and Edwin Encarnacion, and the Pale Hose should improve a lot on their .447 winning percentage from a season ago, even if it might not translate to a playoff berth quite yet.\n\nAs for the Kansas City Royals and Detroit Tigers, both clubs figure to be deep in rebuilding mode yet again this year. Detroit actually made some offseason additions \u2014 Ivan Nova, Cameron Maybin, Jonathan Schoop, C.J. Cron, Austin Romine \u2014 that could lead to greater respectability this year. (Then again, it would have been hard to be less respectable than the 2019 Tigers were.) For their part, the Royals mostly treaded water. But our forecast thinks both teams should avoid challenging the Orioles for the mantle of MLB\u2019s worst team, which is a welcome improvement from 2019, even if true contention is still far off in the future.\n\nHow Elo is forecasting the AL West race Avg.

Sure, a lot of more important things have happened in the country since it was revealed that Houston engaged in a systematic sign-stealing scheme that left their 2017 title tainted, their manager and GM fired and the entire baseball world vowing revenge. But the Astros\u2019 scandal hasn\u2019t gone anywhere \u2014 and neither have the Astros themselves. Houston is still MLB\u2019s third-most talented team according to our Elo ratings, headlined by the usual suspects: Justin Verlander, Alex Bregman, George Springer, Jose Altuve, Yordan Alvarez, Michael Brantley, Zack Greinke, etc., etc. They also have a steady hand at the helm in veteran manager Dusty Baker. Although the Astros probably had the roughest offseason of any team (maybe ever?), losing Cole and several other key contributors on top of the cheating fallout, we give them a 77 percent chance of returning to the postseason, a 59 percent chance of winning the AL West and a 14 percent World Series probability \u2014 tied with the Yankees for the second-best of any team.\n\nBut if Houston does take a step back, the Oakland Athletics are right there waiting in the wings. Oakland won 97 games for the second straight season in 2019 on the strength of superstar performances from Marcus Semien and Matt Chapman \u2014 the rare pair of 7+ WAR teammates in MLB history \u2014 the solid play of Matt Olson, and unheralded contributions from the likes of Mark Canha, Ramon Laureano and Liam Hendrix. All of those guys will return for 2020, and while Brett Anderson, Bailey and Roark departed in the offseason, a talent pipeline that includes starters Jesus Luzardo and A.J. Puk and catcher Sean Murphy should help the A\u2019s once again vie for a playoff appearance.\n\n[Related: How Our MLB Predictions Work]\n\nComing up behind them, the Los Angeles Angels are one of 2020\u2019s most intriguing teams. We all know about Mike Trout, but the offseason additions of ex-Cubs manager Joe Maddon, third baseman Anthony Rendon \u2014 perhaps Trout\u2019s best-ever teammate \u2014 and pitchers Bundy and Julio Teheran, plus Shohei Ohtani\u2019s return to two-way play, give Los Angeles plenty of upside. (Health permitting for some, obviously.) We still give the Halos just a 24 percent chance at the postseason, in part because they\u2019ll face MLB\u2019s ninth-hardest schedule, but they do have the talent to potentially make some noise.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Texas Rangers are another team capable of making the contenders work for every victory. Last year, the club won 78 games under new manager Chris Woodward and hung around the playoff race for a half-season, despite one of its best players (Joey Gallo) missing 92 games. Then Texas spent the offseason adding a few potentially useful names \u2014 Corey Kluber, Robinson Chirinos, Todd Frazier, etc. \u2014 to help christen a new ballpark. Of course, the 2019 Rangers also got very lucky, both in terms of beating their underlying stats and getting unexpectedly great years from 30-something starters Mike Minor and Lance Lynn. We rank them fourth in the division, though they are an interesting fourth at least.\n\nAnd the Seattle Mariners are projected for last place, which is also where they ended up last season after cooling from an inexplicably red-hot start. Seattle has suffered from tremendously bad luck in its MLB-leading 18-year playoff drought, but our model gives that streak little chance of ending anytime soon. The joy and (mostly) tragedy of Seattle baseball was well-documented by SB Nation\u2019s Jon Bois and Alex Rubenstein in their excellent six-part video series this year about the team\u2019s history; it will probably end up being the highlight of 2020 for the Mariners and their fans.\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/baseball-will-be-weird-this-year-but-the-astros-and-yankees-are-favorites-in-the-american-league-again/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "Secret Trump Voters Didn\u2019t Decide 2016 And Probably Won\u2019t Swing 2020", "text": "A recent poll showed that the majority of Pennsylvanians think people in their community secretly support President Trump.

Hand sanitizer is a bulwark that allows my kids to play on an otherwise empty jungle gym. I believe the backyard has magical properties that will, probably, make it just safe enough to see people and talk to them. In the sun and fresh breeze, we give each other air hugs from six-ish feet away.\n\nMeanwhile, my hair grows, untrimmed, past my clavicle. When my friend, in some ways far more stringent on her social distancing and mask wearing than I am, told me about going in for her first cut since March, I winced involuntarily. I assume it\u2019s roughly the same face that she made when I confessed my masked trip to a clothing store to buy some summer dresses. Both of us know the safest thing \u2014 the thing most likely to prevent the spread of COVID-19 \u2014 would be to stay at home, alone. But we know we won\u2019t do that now. Can\u2019t do it. The idea of sticking with the safest thing has become almost as unthinkable as indulging in the danger of a movie in a theater or a drink at the bar. But in between those extremes, life has become a sticky bog in which we wade through evidence and convenience, hoping we\u2019re stepping on solid ground.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nWe can\u2019t live like we did before coronavirus. We won\u2019t live like we did immediately after it appeared, either. Instead, we\u2019re in the muddy middle, faced with choices that seem at once crucial and impossible, simple and massively complicated. These choices are an everyday occurrence, but they also carry a moral weight that makes them feel different than picking a pasta sauce or a pair of shoes. In a pandemic that\u2019s been filled with unanswerable questions and unwinnable wars, this is our daily Kobayashi Maru. And no one can tell us exactly what we ought to do.\n\nNot that there haven\u2019t been attempts at providing structure.\n\nRight now, you can go online and find multiple charts that will visually categorize what were once the activities of daily life by risk level. Some of these charts are evidence based, compiled by experts and (in my opinion) genuinely helpful. I particularly liked the one designed by epidemiologist Saskia Popescu and bioethecist Ezekiel Emanuel because it lays out not just the risk levels of various behaviors \u2014 getting a haircut, visiting the dentist, buying a new shirt \u2014 but also the underlying factors that can make an activity more or less risky. In general, research has shown that indoors is riskier than outside, long visits riskier than short ones, crowds riskier than individuals \u2014 and, look, just avoid situations where you\u2019re being sneezed, yelled, coughed or sung at.\n\nBut the trouble with the muddy middle is that a general idea of what is riskier isn\u2019t the same thing as a clear delineation between right and wrong. These charts \u2014 even the best ones \u2014 aren\u2019t absolute arbiters of safety: They\u2019re the result of surveying experts. In the case of Popescu\u2019s chart, the risk categorizations were assigned based on discussions among herself, Emanuel and Dr. James P. Phillips, the chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University Emergency Medicine. They each independently assigned a risk level to each activity, and then hashed out the ones on which they disagreed.\n\nTake golf. How safe is it to go out to the links? Initially, the three experts had different risk levels assigned to this activity because they were all making different assumptions about what a game of golf naturally involved, Popescu said. \u201cAre people doing it alone? If not, how many people are in a cart? Are they wearing masks? Are they drinking? \u2026. those little variables that can increase the risk,\u201d she told me.\n\nGolf isn\u2019t just golf. It\u2019s how you golf that matters.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nThose variables and assumptions aren\u2019t trivial to calculating risk. Nor are they static. There\u2019s different muck under your boggy feet in different parts of the country, at different times. For instance, how safe is it to eat outdoors with friends? Popescu\u2019s chart ranks \u201coutdoor picnic or porch dining\u201d with people outside your household as low risk \u2014 a very validating categorization, personally. But a chart produced by the Texas Medical Association, based on a survey of its 53,000 physician members, rates \u201cattending a backyard barbeque\u201d as a moderate risk, a 5 on a scale in which 9 is the stuff most of us have no problem eschewing.\n\nWhen we first noticed this apparent contradiction at FiveThirtyEight, some of us joked about how maybe a Texas barbecue wasn\u2019t the same thing as a picnic in New York or Minnesota. Ha ha, everything\u2019s bigger in Texas, even the guest list. But, come to find out, yeah, that\u2019s actually exactly the deal.\n\n[Related: How To Make Indoor Air Safer]\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of social distancing. And different sauce,\u201d said Mark Casanova, a Dallas palliative care specialist and member of the Texas Medical Association\u2019s COVID-19 task force, summing up what makes a Texas barbecue different. When he rated a backyard barbecue, he was thinking of a crowded event, where people roam from indoors to out and back again, and masks are scarce. When he was ranking risk, he was trying to think about real-world behavior, not necessarily the way to do each activity most safely. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a bar and saying, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll just sit by myself.\u2019\u201d Casanova said.\n\nExperts like Popescu and Casanova have focused on harm reduction \u2014 the same philosophy that leads thousands of American gym teachers to demonstrate putting condoms on bananas. We know, from basic understandings of human behavior, that people are going to do a thing (have sex, that is, not put condoms on a banana). So how can we help them be safer?\n\nBut we\u2019re used to safer sex \u2014 we\u2019re not used to safer daily existence. The muddy middle is frustrating not because we\u2019ve never found ourselves in this type of quagmire before, but because the scale of the swamp is so vast and because, just yesterday, it was a garden.\n\n[Related: Why It Took So Long For Politicians To Treat The Child Care Crisis As A Crisis]\n\nWe are faced with too many choices \u2014 not just what to do, but how to do it and when and where. The stakes are high, 140,000 people are dead in the U.S. and death rates are starting to climb again. And because of those stakes, we\u2019ve assigned a morality to all these choices \u2014 something that psychology researchers have shown leads us to frame things as \u201call good\u201d or \u201call bad\u201d and lose sight of the gray areas all around us. We\u2019re all bogged down and floundering, questioning our own goodness while we arch our eyebrows at our friends and argue over whose patch of muck is really solid ground.\n\nIn some ways, it would be easier to just not care, to be one of those people who see no difference among a park, a swamp and the rim of an active volcano, to be one of those people who is mentally living six months ago. Then I could cheerfully traipse from my backyard to a neighbor\u2019s driveway and then on to a dark corner booth somewhere with no worries. No stress. It would hardly even be a decision. Maybe I could even get angry about stores and cities setting up rules and see something like a mask requirement as a violation of my freedoms. Then I could be oblivious to the far more terrible freedom of the muddy middle \u2014 where everything is a choice, and they\u2019re all mine to make and to live with.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-decision-is-a-risk-every-risk-is-a-decision/", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"title": "How To Make Indoor Air Safer", "text": "If you\u2019re waiting for a break from bad news about COVID, don\u2019t hold your breath \u2014 or, actually, do hold your breath.\n\nExperts have understood for months that the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, can be spread by hitching a ride inside large respiratory droplets that are expelled when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. But there\u2019s growing evidence that smaller airborne particles called aerosols can carry and spread the virus, too.\n\nThe methods for preventing spread from respiratory droplets are familiar: social distancing, frequent hand-washing and wearing a mask. But the methods for stopping aerosols, which are lightweight and may be able to hang in the air for hours, are less obvious and often rely on technology. But can something like an air filter really stop a seemingly unstoppable pandemic?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. The larger respiratory droplets that are known to spread the coronavirus are larger bits of spit and mucus that a person propels outward when they forcefully exhale. If the person is infectious, these droplets can be spiked with virus particles which, if they can find their way to your nose, mouth or eyes, can enter your body and cause infection. The droplets are between 5 and 10 microns across (a human hair is, on average, roughly 70 microns in diameter), and they\u2019re heavy, as far as bodily secretions go, so they quickly fall to the floor \u2014 or nearby surface, or nearby facial orifice. But when we talk or laugh or sing or even just breathe, we also produce smaller, lighter droplets (less than 5 microns) that evaporate before gravity can do its thing, causing the dried remnants to stay aloft like a microscopic feather.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, experts weren\u2019t sure if these aerosols could contain enough virus or hang around long enough to actually infect anybody. A person can\u2019t be infected by inhaling one or two viruses \u2014 they need to be exposed to a certain concentration of the virus before it can gain a foothold, though experts still aren\u2019t sure what this threshold, called the infectious dose, is. But now there\u2019s growing evidence that, yes, the aerosols carry the virus and, in a high enough concentration, can cause infection.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a process of elimination. You get to the point where you say, \u2018It sort of looks like aerosol transmission,\u2019\u201d said Lisa M. Brosseau, a research consultant at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. \u201cIn the midst of a pandemic, that\u2019s what you have. You take what evidence you have, what you can observe, and you draw conclusions from that.\u201d\n\nWhen people are outside, aerosol transmission is less of a concern because in wide-open spaces, these particles are quickly dispersed and diluted, making it difficult for an infectious concentration to accumulate, Brosseau said. It\u2019s like dropping some food coloring into a river. But indoors, especially if the ventilation is poor, it\u2019s much easier for aerosols to accumulate \u2014 more like dropping food coloring into a birdbath.\n\nSometimes, though, you can\u2019t avoid taking a dip in those murky waters. The good news is there are ways to dilute and clear out aerosols from indoor spaces. But it requires more effort.\n\nOpening a window can help because it forces fresh air in, and some of the contaminated air will make its way outside. \u201cThere is no doubt that, over time, on average, the concentration of aerosols is going to go down if you open up the windows,\u201d said Rajat Mittal, a mechanical engineering professor who studies aerodynamics at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBut if you\u2019re, say, sitting in a classroom in Minnesota in January, or Arizona in September, opening up the windows might not be the most practical solution.\n\nInstead, school boards and offices should look to their heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. But you can\u2019t just shuffle air around the building \u2014 that could spread the virus to even more places. Instead, you have to replace the air itself.\n\n\u201cYou can achieve an air change by one of two ways,\u201d said David Krause, a certified industrial hygienist and the owner of HealthCare Consulting and Contracting. The first is \u201cthrough the gross changeout of air, bringing in outside air and exhausting air from the room. Or you can achieve it by using high-efficiency filters that effectively remove virus-containing particles from the air.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nFilters can capture virus-laden particles through a number of methods, including physically trapping them with a fine enough filter and using electrostatic attraction to charge particles and force them to settle out of the air.\n\nTo catch the tiny aerosols that might be carrying the coronavirus, filters need a high enough MERV \u2014 yes, MERV. Surely you\u2019ve heard of the minimum efficiency reporting value before, no? A filter with a MERV rating of 1, for example, will capture less than 20 percent of particles that are 3 to 10 microns across. As the MERV rating increases, so does the number of particles it captures, along with the amount of force an HVAC system needs to push the air through the fine filter.\n\nTo effectively neutralize indoor transmission of the novel coronavirus, you\u2019d need a MERV of at least 13, according to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not recommending major modifications to most air conditioning systems. Many of them can simply change out one efficiency of filter for another,\u201d said William Bahnfleth, a professor of architectural engineering at Pennsylvania State University and the chair of ASHRAE\u2019s epidemic task force. \u201cI have MERV-13 filters in my home air conditioner.\u201d\n\nBut changing out the filter alone might not be enough. Krause pointed to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which were published before the COVID-19 pandemic, that outline exactly what standards buildings need to have to achieve \u201cairborne infection isolation,\u201d which means stopping the spread of aerosols smaller than 5 microns. At a minimum, buildings need to be reaching six air changes per hour, according to these CDC guidelines. Krause said the average commercial building now only performs one or two air changes per hour, and could squeeze in another with an air filtration system.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\n\u201cThe other four and a half or five air changes per hour, you\u2019re really going to have to rely on in-room, standalone, HEPA filter air cleaners,\u201d Krause said, referring to high efficiency particulate air filters. \u201cWe should be looking at these if we have any illusions of sending kids back to school.\u201d\n\nAll that filtration can be expensive, though. A commercial-sized MERV-13 filter can cost three to four times more than a lower-standard filter, and portable air cleaners can be up to $1,000 each, according to Krause, so the cost for offices and schools is not small. And using a filtration system creates a new risk for whoever has to change out the virus-soaked filters.\n\nStill, HVAC systems can\u2019t guarantee 100 percent safety. The idea behind all these air changes and filters is to dilute and clean the air so that aerosols can\u2019t build up into high concentrations. But it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that an aerosol will get sucked up by a filter or a ventilation system before it gets sucked up by a person, especially if a lot of people are close together for long periods of time.\n\nUltraviolet light filters could also help: UV light can kill microorganisms, including viruses, but the experts I spoke to raised concerns about this method. For one, killing the virus this way requires continually exposing it to UV light for several minutes \u2014 if it simply floats by a light, such as one in a vent, that might not be enough. For another, UV has other potential risks, including skin and eye damage.\n\nRegardless of what building managers choose to do, their efforts will be moot if people aren\u2019t also taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets by wearing masks, washing their hands frequently and practicing social distancing. All the open windows in the world can\u2019t help if you\u2019re swallowing globs of virus-laden spit.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci | FiveThirtyEight", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-make-indoor-air-safer/", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers"]}, {"title": "Canceled Races Aren\u2019t Stopping Endurance Athletes From Setting Wild New Records", "text": "Just before 6:30 a.m. on June 15, sleep-deprived and feet afire with blisters, Joe \u201cStringbean\u201d McConaughy crossed over Vermont\u2019s border with Massachusetts. After subsisting mostly on watery mashed Oreos and Fritos for the final miles, McConaughy finished a grueling trek along Vermont\u2019s Long Trail in 4 days, 23 hours and 54 minutes \u2014 the fastest an athlete has been known to traverse the entire trail without a prearranged support crew. The 273-mile trail through the Green Mountains takes an average hiker between 20 and 30 days to complete and is known for relentless black flies, knee-deep muddy stretches and varying terrain from thick forest to alpine tundra. It is the oldest long-distance trail in the United States and one of the classics for attempting a fastest known time.\n\nFastest known times, or FKTs, are set by endurance athletes running or hiking a route, either alone or in teams. The goal is to set an unofficial record for finishing a course in the shortest possible time. In an FKT attempt, there are no bibs, no crowds and no medals. Whether deep in Appalachia or on the lip of the Grand Canyon, athletes are able to compete while maintaining physical distance from others. It just might be the perfect coronavirus pursuit. And as it turns out, the FKT scene has exploded this year.\n\nAs COVID-19 shut down state after state, many organized endurance races were canceled or rescheduled. The New York City Marathon \u2014 which would have celebrated its golden anniversary this year \u2014 and the never-before-canceled Boston Marathon are among the most well-known and highly anticipated races that have been nixed. In the ultra-trail-running world, cornerstone races Ultra Trail du Mont-Blanc in Europe and Barkley Marathon in Tennessee have also been scrapped this year.\n\nFor athletes who ramped themselves into peak form for spring and summer marathons, there are a few options other than scaling back their training plans. They could do what one guy did and run a marathon on his terrace during lockdown. They could join a number of virtual races. Or, they could lace up and run through the night from the Canadian border to Massachusetts, like McConaughy did.\n\nSo how many athletes are following suit? We took a look at the data from FastestKnownTime.com, the central website for submitting FKTs, to see just how many records have fallen so far this year.\n\nRunners submitted 3.8 times as many FKTs through June of this year as in the same period a year ago. \u201cNot only in the numbers, but there\u2019s been a huge uptick in the amount of work for us,\u201d said Peter Bakwin, one of the creators of FastestKnownTime.com. There is no official governing organization for FKT routes and records, but Bakwin and his co-founders, Buzz Burrell and Jeff Schuler, act as the volunteer commissioners for approving routes and verifying times. FKT attempts had been gaining in popularity even before this year, but submissions in the past few months reflect the type of growth Bakwin and Burrell expected to see five years from now. Many of the submissions cited canceled races as the reason for the FKT attempt, they said.\n\nSome associations that care for long-distance trails like the Appalachian Trail and Pacific Crest Trail are recommending that through-hikers postpone or cancel their hikes this year to avoid spreading the virus on trails and into nearby towns. Those who hit the trails anyway are advised to stay local and be self-supported (so, carry what you need on and off the trail and avoid going into local towns or using trail amenities like outhouses). Because rules and recommendations have changed often in the past few months, Bakwin and Burrell are reluctant to play police. \u201cEarly on we did have to confront that question and basically we don\u2019t want to have to verify what\u2019s legal with changing laws \u2014 we just don\u2019t have the capacity to do that,\u201d Bakwin said.\n\nBut the site is also getting submissions from people who are creating their own local adventures, which means many new, interesting routes. A loop through Central Park might not seem creative on its face, but Aaron Zellheofer added an interesting new mechanic: Rather than running a single loop as fast as he could, he aimed to run as many laps of the main road as he could during the hours the park was open (6 a.m. to 1 a.m.). He ran 11 6.1-mile laps.\n\n\u201cWe were OK with it because Central Park truly is classic, the route around the park is defined, and his timing was also very defined,\u201d Burrell said. \u201cAnd there are millions of people who live right there, so that\u2019s one that a lot of people could contest,\u201d Bakwin added.\n\nLockdowns have left many with time to plan routes and strategies for an FKT. The sport is inherently creative in that runners only have to adhere to a fairly vague seven-point list when crafting a route. That flexibility also allows nonelite runners to submit a route\u2019s first FKT, earning them a spot on the website. \u201cOften they\u2019ll [submit a route and] say, \u2018My time can easily be beat,\u2019\u201d Bakwin said. \u201cBut, you know \u2014 if you can\u2019t be fast, be first.\u201d\n\nThough the majority of the site\u2019s FKTs are for routes in the United States, times can be submitted for courses in any country. And this year, Bakwin said he has seen a surge of routes in Europe, particularly from Germany, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland and the U.K. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but some countries are totally into it,\u201d Bakwin said. \u201cI think they must have just got wind of it, and when one or two guys start talking about it over it there, I\u2019m guessing the community is not that big.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for 2020, Bakwin and Burrell put together a list of 10 \u201cpremier routes\u201d (all in the United States) to encourage FKT attempts this year. The goal is to attract more elite athletes who are more likely to have a corporate sponsor who will help track and document the attempt, which the site\u2019s organizers hoped will quell some verification controversies in previous FKTs.\n\nFastestKnownTimes.com breaks record attempts down into three categories: supported (getting help or supplies from people you\u2019ve arranged to meet up with along the way), self-supported (no prearranged help, but cadging food or water from people you happen across is allowed) and unsupported (you carry everything you need from start to finish. ) McConaughy had set out to attempt an unsupported FKT on the Long Trail, but he ended up accepting water along the route, turning his trek \u2014 in which he cruised at around 54 miles a day \u2014 into a self-supported FKT. Less than a month later, Brett Mastrangelo attempted to usurp McConaughy\u2019s record but had to call it quits two days in because of a leg injury. And plenty of other athletes are making their FKT attempts on premier routes this year: Sarah Hansel just completed the first unsupported women\u2019s attempt at Nolan\u2019s 14 (a route covering 14 mountains in Colorado) on July 8, while Avery Collins started the trail but did not finish. Liz Anjos is in the second week of her attempt on the Appalachian Trail. Two others are publicly posting the tracker data during their FKT attempts as they challenge the current supported and self-supported records on the Colorado Trail.\n\nWill the popularity of the FKT continue? Before the pandemic, Bakwin and Burrell couldn\u2019t have predicted that the sport would catch fire this year, and they\u2019re not sure what to expect after races can safely start again. \u201cThe unforeseen consequences of a global pandemic are many and surprising,\u201d Bakwin said. \u201cI would guess that once races start happening again, some of the traffic will taper off, but some people will have found a new thing that they will make part of their training and racing season rather than races.\u201d", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/canceled-races-arent-stopping-endurance-athletes-from-setting-wild-new-records/", "author": ["Anna Wiederkehr"]}, {"title": "Politics Podcast: There Aren\u2019t Secret Trump Voters", "text": "A recent Monmouth poll showed that a majority of Pennsylvanians \u2014 57 percent \u2014 believe there are \u201csecret\u201d voters in their communities who support Trump but won\u2019t tell anyone about it.

The WNBA is set to begin its season on July 25, while the NBA \u2014 the league whose abrupt shutdown set off a cascade of matching shutdowns in other sports \u2014 will restart its own season on July 30 at Walt Disney World.\n\nAs of today, it has been 131 days since the NBA last conducted a regular-season game, so you\u2019d be forgiven for not necessarily recalling the particulars of where things left off. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here. Ahead of the resumption of the NBA season, we want to give you a brief refresher on the 22 teams that were invited to Orlando: who they are, where they were when we last saw them, whether they have sustained any confirmed or reported coronavirus cases, what else has changed for them during the four-plus-month hiatus, and what we can expect from them during both the seeding games and \u2014 if they\u2019re lucky enough to make it there \u2014 the playoffs.\n\n[Related: Our NBA Predictions]\n\nWe\u2019re breaking these 22 teams down into three tiers: the inner-circle contenders, the potential party-crashers and those that are seemingly along for the ride for no particular reason beyond the league wanting to maximize the number of games played (and, thus, revenue earned). We\u2019ll begin below with that final group, which consists of the nine teams invited to the restart that have yet to secure postseason positioning.\n\nPhoenix Suns\n\n26-39, 13th in West, 6 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: <1% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 3-5; 29-44\n\nCOVID-19: Two unnamed players (reported)\n\nThe Suns face the toughest climb of any remaining team to actually make it to the playoffs. They are six games and five spots back of the eighth-seeded Grizzlies, which means they need to pick up at least two games on Memphis and pass four other teams in the standings just to make it to a potential play-in round, where they\u2019d need to win back-to-back games to claim a postseason berth. They\u2019ll have to make that run without the services of forward Kelly Oubre, who is in Orlando with the team but will not participate in the restart as he focuses on rehabbing from the torn meniscus he suffered in late February. FiveThirtyEight projects the Suns will go 3-5 against the seventh-toughest seeding-game schedule among teams invited to the restart, leaving them far short of securing a playoff berth.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs\n\n27-36, 12th in West, 4 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: <1% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 2-6; 29-42\n\nCOVID-19: No public reports or announcements\n\nSan Antonio comes into the restart without either of its two starting big men. LaMarcus Aldridge was shut down after having surgery on his right shoulder, while Trey Lyles underwent an appendectomy and was also declared out for the remainder of the season. The Spurs were already facing long odds to make the playoffs, but they got even longer when Aldridge went down. Their defense has not been up to snuff all year, which means they were going to have to depend on outscoring teams. This will be much more difficult to do without Aldridge, who propped up a unit that checked in only slightly above-average anyway. In the absence of him and Lyles, San Antonio will likely have to play much smaller than it usually has this season, and veteran forward Rudy Gay recently indicated the team\u2019s young players might see more a extended run during the seeding games.\n\nWashington Wizards\n\n24-40, 9th in East, 5.5 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 5% playoffs, <1% East, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 2-6; 26-46\n\nCOVID-19: Gary Payton Jr. (reported), Thomas Bryant (reported)\n\nThe lone out-of-playoff-position team from the East invited to make the trip to Disney, the Wizards will be incredibly shorthanded in Orlando. Pending free-agent sniper D\u0101vis Bert\u0101ns opted out of the restart, while All-Star guard Bradley Beal will sit out with a shoulder injury. John Wall also remains sidelined, as he has been for the entire season. The Wizards have to pick up 1.5 games on the Magic or two games on the Nets to qualify for a potential play-in round, but they face a tougher schedule than either of those two teams and will also be without their three best players. Accordingly, we predict the Wiz to fall even further back from the pack than they are right now.\n\nSacramento Kings\n\n28-36, 11th in West, 3.5 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 7% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 3-5; 31-41\n\nCOVID-19: Harrison Barnes (announced), Alex Len (reported), Buddy Hield (returned to practice), Jabari Parker (returned to practice)\n\nOne of several teams that shut down their practice facility ahead of traveling to Orlando in the wake of a positive test for a member of their traveling party, the Kings have had more publicly confirmed COVID cases than any other team in the restart since leaguewide testing began in early July. A few of those players have returned to practice, but star guard De\u2019Aaron Fox sprained his ankle during one of those sessions, and the Kings announced Wednesday evening that he would be reevaluated in seven to 10 days. Their outlook appears bleak if Fox is not 100 percent, despite facing one of the league\u2019s easiest remaining schedules.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers\n\n29-37, 9th in West, 3.5 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 12% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 3-5; 32-42\n\nCOVID-19: No public reports or announcements\n\nPortland, more than any other team in the league, benefited from the season\u2019s interruption. When they return to the floor, the Blazers may be without Trevor Ariza, but they\u2019ll get both Jusuf Nurki\u0107 and Zach Collins back. The Blazers\u2019 preferred starters in the front court are each set to return from the long-term injuries that had limited Collins to just three games and kept Nurkic out all year. The boost to their roster and the question marks surrounding other No. 8-seed contenders would seemingly have the Blazers poised to make a run at the play-in round, but they have the misfortune of facing the fifth-toughest remaining schedule, with games against the Celtics, Rockets, Nuggets, Clippers and 76ers. They do open against the Grizzlies and close against the severely shorthanded Nets, though, so perhaps their chances of making it beyond the seeding games are being slightly underrated at just 12 percent.\n\nMemphis Grizzlies\n\n32-33, 8th in West\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 36% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 3-5; 35-38 (play-in participant vs. NOP)\n\nCOVID-19: No public reports or announcements\n\nBefore the season came to a screeching halt, the Grizzlies were this season\u2019s most pleasant surprise. Led by star rookie Ja Morant, the youngest team in the NBA managed to bounce back from a 6-16 start by amassing the league\u2019s ninth-best record from Dec. 8 on, and it enters the restart with a sizable lead in the race for the No. 8 seed in the West. However, despite the fact the Grizzlies will likely get Justise Winslow back on the floor now that his back injury has had time to heal, FiveThirtyEight is pessimistic about their chances of holding onto their spot. While the Elo-specific forecast (which is based mostly on this season\u2019s performance, as well as some of last season\u2019s) gives the Grizzlies a 69 percent chance of advancing to the postseason, the version of the forecast powered by RAPTOR player ratings pegs that chance at only 38 percent, instead favoring the next team on our list despite the fact that it needs to make up some ground or else win a play-in series.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans\n\n28-36, 10th in West, 3.5 games back\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 45% playoffs, <1% West, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 5-3; 33-39 (play-in participant vs. POR)\n\nCOVID-19: Three unnamed players (announced)\n\nSuperstar rookie Zion Williamson left the bubble last week to deal with what the Pelicans described as an \u201curgent family medical matter.\u201d He\u2019s expected to rejoin the team at some point, and our projections have not yet been tweaked to account for his potential absence \u2014 largely because we do not yet know how long said absence might be, or if he\u2019ll return in time to take part in all eight seeding games. Zion or no Zion, the Pelicans need to remain within four games of the Grizzlies (while also holding off the Blazers, Spurs, Kings and Suns) to force a play-in series. The system currently favors the Pellies to grab the No. 8 seed from the Grizz\u2019s clutches, the result of both New Orleans\u2019 strong roster ratings (in which Williamson\u2019s presence factors heavily) and a cupcake schedule that is the easiest of any team invited to Disney.\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\n30-34, 7th in East\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: 95% playoffs, <1% East, <1% Finals\n\nProjected seeding W-L: 2-6; 32-40 (8th in East)\n\nCOVID-19: Kevin Durant and three unnamed teammates (announced), DeAndre Jordan (out), Spencer Dinwiddie (out), Taurean Prince (out), Michael Beasley (out)\n\nThe Nets will be practically unrecognizable in Orlando. As you may have already forgotten, Kenny Atkinson and the team \u201cmutually agreed to part ways\u201d this year, with Atkinson being replaced by interim coach Jacque Vaughn. Vaughn immediately inserted Jordan into the starting lineup ahead of Jarrett Allen, but Jordan tested positive for COVID-19 and so, along with his buddies Durant and Kyrie Irving, he will not be participating in the restart. He\u2019s not the only one. Dinwiddie and Prince are also out of the lineup with positive coronavirus tests, while Wilson Chandler opted out of the restart because of concerns for his family\u2019s health. The Nets signed several substitute players to account for their various absences, but one of those players was Beasley, who later tested positive for COVID-19 and left the bubble. Still, we expect Brooklyn will hang onto its playoff spot and narrowly avoid a play-in series against the Wizards.\n\nOrlando Magic\n\n30-35, 8th in East\n\nFiveThirtyEight predictions: >99% playoffs, <1% East, <1% Finals\n\nProjected Seeding W-L: 4-4; 34-39 (7th in East)\n\nCOVID-19: James Ennis (recovered)\n\nThe Magic have the benefit of participating in a restart held essentially in their own backyard. They, like other banged-up teams, also had the time they needed for injuries to heal. Specifically, Evan Fournier is expected to return from the elbow injury that sidelined him prior to the hiatus, giving the Magic back one of their top scorers. Orlando\u2019s restart schedule is significantly tougher than the one it would have faced down the stretch of the actual regular season, but it still ranks in the bottom third of remaining teams. That, plus Brooklyn\u2019s spate of absences, leads our predictions to believe the Magic will leapfrog the Nets for the No. 7 seed in the East, thus avoiding having to face the Bucks in the first round.\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whos-who-in-the-nba-bubble-the-teams-just-along-for-the-ride/", "author": ["Jared Dubin"]}, {"title": "Do You Buy That \u2026 Mail-In Voting Will Hurt Republicans?", "text": "Send to Email Address\n\nYour Name\n\nYour Email Address\n\nPost was not sent - check your email addresses!\n\nEmail check failed, please try again\n\nSorry, your blog cannot share posts by email.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/do-you-buy-that-mail-in-voting-will-hurt-republicans/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "Secret Trump Voters Didn\u2019t Decide 2016 And Probably Won\u2019t Swing 2020", "text": "A recent poll showed that the majority of Pennsylvanians think people in their community secretly support President Trump.

For months the country was focused on reopening the economy, which had its own complicated set of problems. But only recently has a broader swath of America tuned into the mess nestled inside it, one that parents have been sitting with for months: what to do with the kids.\n\nThere has been no federal plan to help American parents with child care, and they continue to wonder whether schools will really open their doors come the new school year. That lack of action is in direct contrast to other crises that have struck America recently. After the financial crash of 2008, there was a bailout and a stimulus plan. After the protests against police over the last few months, officials in cities and states responded with promises of better actions in the future but also, immediate policy implementation: New York state repealed a law that had shielded police personnel files, while the Minneapolis City Council voted to begin a process that could eventually lead to the dissolution of the city police as it\u2019s now known.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nBut on child care and school, a specific, urgent response has been missing, or at least one that acknowledges our new reality. President Trump threatened to withhold federal funding for education if schools didn\u2019t open back up, counter to schools\u2019 insistence they need more money to provide a safe education amid the pandemic. While the CARES Act, an omnibus COVID-19 relief bill signed into law in late March, gave extra stimulus funding to families with children, schools and child care businesses so they could remain afloat, a Democratic-backed bill to give a $50 billion bailout of the child care industry has gotten little attention. Teachers around the country have voiced doubt that necessary safety measures for in-school teaching will be sufficient, and Los Angeles Unified School District, one of the country\u2019s largest school systems, has decided not to reopen classrooms when schools go back in session in August. Some worry that while distance learning is safer, socially different children and those without stable internet connections or computers \u2014 who are already at the margins in normal times \u2014 will fall irrevocably behind.\n\nThere is no cohesive solution to America\u2019s child care problem. But the relative inattention to this crisis, one that\u2019s so foundational to a functioning society, the economy and family units across the country, is revealing. It shows that for all the changes that have happened in American life \u2014 more female elected officials, a MeToo movement and a workforce that is around 47 percent female \u2014 our power dynamics remain fundamentally skewed. We are failing to collectively understand what our most critical and pressing problems actually are.\n\n\u201cCare in general has always been seen as a sideline issue,\u201d Vicki Shabo of the left-leaning think tank New America said. \u201cA nice-to-have and not something that\u2019s necessary, and not something that\u2019s central for adults to be productive in the economy.\u201d Of course, now we\u2019re seeing how much of a misunderstanding that is. In a country where most men and women work even when they have children, having child care is inextricably linked to economic productivity \u2014 and not having it often hurts women most. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2015 found that in households with children under 6, women spent an hour a day doing child care, compared to the 25 minutes of care provided by men. It\u2019s easy to extrapolate this trend for pandemic times: American women will bear the brunt of the school and child care crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: COVID-19 deaths are rising. What will the U.S. do?\n\nYet, child care in particular hasn\u2019t often found itself at the forefront of political debate. Experts and activists I talked to for this story all used the same framing to talk about why: an American narrative that child care problems are individuals\u2019 problems, not society\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIf you think about child care traditionally before the pandemic, you probably didn\u2019t think about it too much before you had kids,\u201d Melissa Boteach, vice president of income security and child care at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said. \u201cThen you have kids, you\u2019re in the most stressful and resource-strapped part of your life: You\u2019re operating on three hours of sleep a night, you\u2019re financially squeezed, because at the very time you\u2019re taking off of work, you have diapers and wipes and formula and whatever else. You\u2019re in this total daze of early motherhood. That\u2019s probably not the time when you say, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to call my member of Congress.\u2019 You\u2019re feeling it like a personal issue.\u201d\n\nChild care isn\u2019t necessarily seen as a macroeconomic issue or a driver of labor force participation or GDP, Shabo said. And because of that, she said, it often takes a backseat to economic issues like wages when lobbying efforts happen. This is not to say that child care issues don\u2019t get attention \u2014 in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, which featured several female candidates, child care plans took a more front and center role in the campaign than they had in the past. One leading candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, co-authored a 2004 book, \u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d which was about the ways the rising incomes of households with two full-time employed adults belied the heavy costs of essentials like child care. Warren thought child care costs were among the reasons the American middle class was in an economic crisis.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\n\u201cOur workplaces were built for white men,\u201d said Danielle Atkinson, the founder and director of Mothering Justice, a Detroit-area advocacy group for working families. The fact that parents are left to fend for themselves from birth to kindergarten and then during the after-school, pre-dinner hours, is an American tradition that seems to assume a readily available, at-home caregiver. (Atkinson pointed out the inextricable role black women have played in American child care; enslaved women often took care of white children.) The nuclear family with a stay-at-home parent (usually a mother) is an ideal that persists, or at the very least lingers in American life: only 18 percent of Americans in a 2018 Pew Research Survey thought it was ideal for both parents to work full time.\n\n\u201cThis conversation about school is really a conversation about work,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cThe conversation about returning to school is not based on health. It\u2019s about returning those workers to working and not looking after their children, so those children have to be somewhere.\u201d Essential workers in particular are being forced to make difficult choices about their children\u2019s care \u2014 many essential-worker jobs are lower wage \u2014 and many child care providers are in strapped situations. The work of child care providers, Atkinson said, is often undervalued \u2014 their median annual wage in 2017 was a little more than $22,000 annually, which is just above the federal government\u2019s poverty line for a family of three \u2014 and as Boteach pointed out, those workers could continue to risk greater infection rates as schools and work open back up. She highlighted the plan put forth by Senate Democrats, the Child Care Is Essential Act \u2014 which would provide a bailout to the suffering industry and additional money for those providers to buy personal protective equipment \u2014 and cited an estimate that the U.S. child care industry would need a $9.6 billion injection monthly to survive the pandemic.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nIt\u2019s more likely the next governmental nod to parents and their school-age children will come in the next iteration of the omnibus coronavirus relief package. Congressional Democrats have proposed $350 billion in funds for schools and universities to purchase PPE and clean their facilities. Republicans agree about more funds, though it\u2019s not clear what their proposed number is \u2014 some have argued that since many schools will be operating on a partly virtual basis, less federal funding is needed.\n\nThe moral tussling that many parents have been doing \u2014 go back to work and risk potential COVID-19 infection at day care or school \u2014 will likely continue to be subjected to partisan politics. Trump and his Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have been the loudest voices in recent days about sending children back to school at all costs, much to the chagrin of teachers, many of whom feel ill-prepared for the safety precautions necessary for in-person pandemic teaching. Ultimately, though, it is parents who are forced to make a choice. Atkinson, a mother of six, told me she would be keeping her children home in the fall.\n\n[Related: The Latest Political Polls Collected By FiveThirtyEight]\n\nFor those who focus on child care, the pandemic has perversely presented an opportunity to advance the cause of greater access to guaranteed services. \u201cThis pandemic has created greater alignment of experience, potentially, between white middle class folks who saw this as an individual issue that they were struggling with and outraged by but hadn\u2019t really taken action on and the longtime, long-standing lived experience of lower wage folks and people of color who have struggled for decades with the unaffordability of child care and the lack of care options to meet their work schedules,\u201d Shabo said.\n\nAtkinson said she also hoped the individualism narrative would be shattered by the current crisis. \u201cWe want to lift the veil away and help women, especially white women, know that you\u2019ve been lied to. You were sold a bunch of lies: \u2018if you just work harder, if you just slay sexism, you\u2019ll be OK.\u2019 But really, it\u2019s a tool to divide,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pandemic has shattered norms and paradigms ever since it arrived in the U.S. \u2014 our expectations of child care is no exception.

They wanted to open up, so they went through the guidelines of opening up their state. But what happened is that many of the citizenry, said, \u201cYou know, well, I\u2019m either going to be locked down or I\u2019m going to let it all rip.\u201d And you could see from just looking, documented on TV and in the papers of still photos of people at bars and congregations, which are a perfect setup, particularly if you don\u2019t have a mask. Yeah, then there are some times when despite the guidelines and the recommendations to open up carefully and prudently, some states skipped over those and just opened up too quickly.\n\nAR: Do you think that Florida and Arizona opened up too quickly?\n\nAF: You know, I think in some respects, in some cases, they did not always. But I think that that certainly is contributing to that. Certainly Florida I know, you know, I think jumped over a couple of checkpoints.\n\n\n\n\n\nFauci on why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a surge in cases l FiveThirtyEight\n\nOn whether partisanship makes fighting COVID-19 more difficult:\n\nAR You know, for a few months, masks were quite a partisan issue, though in the past few weeks politicians on both sides have advocated for their use. Do you think America\u2019s hyperpartisan environment has made it more difficult to suppress the virus?\n\nAF: You know, I think you\u2019d have to admit that that\u2019s the case. We live, I mean, you have to be having blindfolders on and covering your ears to think that we don\u2019t live in a very divisive society now, from a political standpoint. I mean, it\u2019s just unfortunate, but it is what it is. And you know, from experience historically, that when you don\u2019t have unanimity in an approach to something, you\u2019re not as effective in how you handle it. So I think you\u2019d have to make the assumption that if there wasn\u2019t such divisiveness, that we would have a more coordinated approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nFauci on whether partisanship makes fighting COVID-19 more difficult\n\nOn how the U.S. is doing:\n\nAR: How do you think the U.S. is doing right now? If you\u2019re looking across the world, what are your feelings about how we\u2019re doing right now?\n\nAF: Well, let me say there are parts of the United States, like where you live right now [in New York], that are doing really well, that you\u2019ve been through something really bad and you have things under control. And you have a governor and mayor in the city who understand what it means to go by the guidelines for the gateway, phase one, phase two, phase three. So you\u2019re doing well. Other cities are doing well. But as a country, when you compare us to other countries, I don\u2019t think you can say we\u2019re doing great. I mean, we\u2019re just not.\n\nOn travel restrictions:\n\nAR: We\u2019re at this weird place now where the EU and some other European countries are opening their borders, but they\u2019re still banning travel from the United States. Do you think that\u2019s a justified decision on their part?\n\nAF: You know, I wouldn\u2019t use the word justified. I would say it\u2019s understandable. Because, you know, when we saw that there were many cases in Europe and in China, we banned travel from the European Union, from the U.K., to us. So right now, they have their infection rate very low, much lower than we do. So they\u2019re looking at us and they\u2019re saying the same thing that we said to them. I wish that that were not the case. I wouldn\u2019t be recommending that. I think we need to get back to some sort of normality. Just the same as they\u2019re saying to us, \u201cWhy are you still banning travel from Europe?\u201d Which we are. I mean, so I\u2019m all for America and I back what we do. But if I were a European, then I\u2019d be looking at us. I\u2019d say, \u201cWhy are you still banning Europeans from coming to the United States?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFauci on travel restrictions during the pandemic and the EU ban l FiveThirtyEight\n\nOn whether we can get control of the virus without a vaccine:\n\nAR: Without a vaccine, how hopeful are you that we\u2019ll get this pandemic under control in the U.S.?\n\nAF: I think we can get it under control. But keeping it under control is going to be the real problem. Because this virus is not like other viruses that we\u2019ve experienced, like the original SARS from 2002. That was a coronavirus. It caused an outbreak, a pandemic \u2014 there were 8,000 cases and 800 deaths. So in magnitude alone, you see how different it is from what we\u2019re doing now. But it was not really very well and efficiently transmissible, whereas this virus, to our dismay, is spectacularly efficient in transmitting from person to person. So that makes me skeptical whether we would get permanent, sustained control of this without having a vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nFauci on whether we can get control of the virus without a vaccine | FiveThirtyEight\n\nOn how anti-vaxxers affect what will happen once a vaccine is discovered:\n\nAR: One thing I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about is that, you know, with any vaccine, even after it goes through extensive clinical trials, there is always some risk of adverse effects. And even if the side effects with the COVID vaccine, whatever it may be, are extremely small, it\u2019s going to get more media attention than probably any other vaccine in history. At the same time, we also have a growing anti-vaccine movement in this country and around the world. So I\u2019m wondering whether you and other other public health officials are concerned about kind of the long term impact of this moment on vaccine acceptance?\n\nAF: That\u2019s a great question, Anna. Because what it really tells us is that we got to get it right. We really do. Because if we don\u2019t, it might have a real negative impact in the long range, in the long term, on how people approach and respond to the need for vaccination, which is the reason why we\u2019re taking so seriously that even though we\u2019re doing this quickly, we\u2019re not compromising the safety and nor are we compromising the scientific integrity. So as we go into the phase three trials, not only are we going to be looking at efficacy, but we\u2019re going to be really paying attention: Is there anything there that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s even suggestive of a negative impact? That\u2019s going to be really very important. So that\u2019s a really important question you asked.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dr-fauci-partisanship-has-made-it-more-difficult-to-suppress-covid-19/", "author": ["Anna Rothschild", "Jake Arlow"]}, {"title": "America Is Testing For COVID-19 More Than Ever \u2014 And It Still Isn\u2019t Enough", "text": "America Is Testing For COVID-19 More Than Ever \u2014 And It Still Isn\u2019t Enough\n\nExpert consensus was clear early in the pandemic: To control the spread of COVID-19, the U.S. needed to increase testing. Four months on, we are testing more \u2014 a lot more. The number of Americans getting tested daily is higher than at any point in this pandemic, and we\u2019re testing more people per capita than almost any other country on the planet.\n\nYet many experts say we still need more tests.\n\nDespite a steady increase in testing infrastructure, the U.S. is caught in a vicious cycle with no end in sight. A lag in testing leads to more cases, which leads to the need for even more tests to finally get a handle on the pandemic. We\u2019ve been playing catch up from the beginning, and, experts say, we\u2019re still not close to closing the gap in most states.\n\nIn early May, for example, a group of researchers at the Harvard Global Health Institute calculated the average daily number of tests each state and Washington, D.C., would need to conduct in order to begin reopening later that month. At the end of June, the researchers adjusted those numbers. In 18 states and D.C., the June testing goals for mitigating the pandemic were lower than the goals first proposed in May since the pandemic had waned there. But in the rest of the country, the testing goals were higher. Of these 32 states with higher testing goals in June, just six had an average daily testing rate last month that met the goal, and 13 still didn\u2019t have an average daily testing rate that met the May benchmarks.\n\nThe majority of states and U.S. are lagging behind in testing The difference in the average number of tests and the Harvard Global Health Institute\u2019s mitigation testing goal for each state, D.C. and the country JUNE testing AVERAGE HARVARD JUNE GOAL Difference Hawaii 771 192 +301% Vermont 1,060 265 +300% Alaska 2,016 520 +288% Montana 1,702 553 +208% New Jersey 22,541 7,346 +207% West Virginia 2,471 923 +168% Connecticut 7,212 2,769 +160% New York 61,704 29,591 +109% D.C. 1,694 1,002 +69% Maine 1,511 952 +59% Delaware 1,674 1,268 +32% Illinois 23,525 19,116 +23% Massachusetts 8,510 7,333 +16% South Dakota 1,199 1,041 +15% Idaho 1,420 1,363 +4% Rhode Island 2,926 2,893 +1% North Dakota 1,136 1,129 +1% New Hampshire 1,601 1,622 -1% Maryland 7,799 8,292 -6% Indiana 7,422 8,051 -8% Michigan 13,810 15,646 -12% Oklahoma 4,946 5,816 -15% Nebraska 2,567 3,133 -18% Wyoming 309 394 -21% Pennsylvania 10,284 13,326 -23% Kansas 2,726 3,574 -24% New Mexico 4,776 7,044 -32% Louisiana 11,780 17,896 -34% Minnesota 10,729 17,361 -38% Oregon 3,614 6,152 -41% Kentucky 5,239 9,523 -45% Wisconsin 10,018 19,196 -48% Iowa 4,930 9,497 -48% Virginia 10,988 22,422 -51% Nevada 4,500 9,518 -53% Missouri 5,982 13,007 -54% United States 509,782 1,165,199 -56% Washington 7,003 16,062 -56% Tennessee 11,905 27,894 -57% Ohio 13,234 35,148 -62% Colorado 4,774 12,979 -63% Arkansas 6,056 16,668 -64% Utah 4,228 11,710 -64% California 74,076 222,862 -67% North Carolina 16,458 51,305 -68% Texas 30,581 117,119 -74% Florida 30,788 142,300 -78% Georgia 12,278 64,048 -81% South Carolina 6,012 32,831 -82% Alabama 6,303 41,577 -85% Arizona 10,238 74,135 -86% Mississippi 3,857 28,835 -87% * These 16 states report the number of specimens tested, not people, in their testing reports. Because some people may be tested more than once, these numbers are probably higher than the number of people tested. Texas reports a mix of specimens and people tested. Wyoming switched from reporting data on specimens tested to people on June 19. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare includes a small number of out-of-state residents among its counts. Source: the covid tracking project, Harvard global health institute\n\n\u201cWe are finally hitting the numbers that we needed to hit in March, but it\u2019s July,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and researcher at Harvard who co-authored the testing analysis. \u201cAnd in that interim, hundreds of thousands of new cases have erupted.\u201d\n\nThere are lots of factors that have likely contributed to the fact that the U.S.\u2019s COVID-19 case numbers haven\u2019t dropped the way other countries\u2019 have. But a lack of sufficient testing has made it that much harder to implement any strategy that might help the country overcome those factors. Take contact tracing, for example, a strategy deployed in South Korea early in the pandemic with great success. Ideally, whenever someone tests positive for COVID-19, they\u2019d isolate themselves, and public health workers would contact everyone that person had contact with recently and test them for COVID-19 too. If any of those people test positive, they isolate themselves, and then their recent contacts are tested. None of this is possible without testing.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nThe Harvard testing goals aren\u2019t meant to encourage us to just randomly test 1.2 million Americans every day and hope the virus disappears. The idea is that if we were sufficiently testing to track, trace and isolate positive cases, we\u2019d be seeing daily testing numbers closer to 1.2 million, instead of 600,000.\n\n\u201cI do not want to overstate the kind of magical nature of testing,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, during an online press conference. \u201cThe lack of testing makes it difficult to control the virus, but even if you have adequate capacity, even if you have deployed it effectively, you\u2019ve got to do something with that.\u201d\n\nThe shortfall in testing numbers is due to two pervasive but opposite problems. First, some labs and clinics have a shortage of supplies and a backlog of tests, sometimes running out of tests five minutes after opening, according to a report in The New York Times, other times causing a wait of seven days or more to get test results. That\u2019s partly the result of the country\u2019s original missteps when it comes to testing, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention originally manufacturing faulty tests, and a general lack of preparedness for an epidemic, from which we never fully recovered.\n\nThe second problem speaks to a deeper, more psychological issue. Many states have the capacity for more testing, but people just aren\u2019t lining up to get tested, and contact tracers have reported difficulty getting in touch with individuals who have crossed paths with someone who later tested positive for COVID-19. Dr. Michael Hochman, a professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California, said this might be due to a sense of fatigue about the pandemic. \u201cAt a certain point, you get tested once or twice \u2014 I see this with my patients, they\u2019re like \u2018oh, this was a waste of time,\u2019\u201d Hochman said. \u201cIn the beginning, my patients were calling me asking to get tested. Those calls aren\u2019t coming in anymore.\u201d\n\n[Related: The Science of Mask-Wearing Hasn\u2019t Changed. So Why Have Our Expectations?]\n\nThere are also other factors that discourage people from getting tested, including costs (while tests are free, the appointment needed to get a test often isn\u2019t), concerns about missing work, or even local limitations on who is allowed to get tested.\n\nAll of this still means we have a lack of testing, but not necessarily for a lack of trying.\n\nThe U.S. had an opportunity to close the testing gap. During lockdown, strict social distancing helped case numbers drop and lessened the strain on health care systems. As soon as states ease restrictions and begin to allow businesses to reopen, cases are bound to rise. But if, during lockdown, states had ramped up testing dramatically by creating a strong supply chain and expanding testing parameters beyond actively sick individuals,, they would have had the necessary infrastructure to address future rises in cases, according to Tsai.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nInstead, states gradually increased testing while simultaneously lifting restrictions, a double-whammy that all but guaranteed the surge in cases we\u2019re seeing now, with little ability to nip local outbreaks in the bud.\n\nThink of it like a forest fire (an analogy a few experts have been using). If you have a handful of small brush fires, you can find them and control them. If you don\u2019t know they\u2019re there, they can quickly turn into a raging forest fire that is much harder to control. Without sufficient testing when cases are low, those cases can go undetected, possibly by people who have mild or no symptoms and are out in the community spreading the disease to more people. This becomes an even higher risk as cities and states start to reopen.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough right now because the case numbers are so high that to do really efficient testing, tracing, and isolation, we\u2019re going to need a whole lot of tests,\u201d said Tara Smith, an epidemiologist at Kent State University.\n\nThere are some experts who argue we don\u2019t need to dramatically increase testing further, such as Hochman, who has written on the topic. Hochman argues the current level of testing should be sufficient to inform public health responses. But the problem is we\u2019re not executing those responses well, either.\n\n\u201cMasks, social distancing and hygiene are the three things that make the biggest difference, and testing is probably four or five on that list,\u201d Hochman said.\n\nTesting on its own doesn\u2019t equal success in the battle against the novel coronavirus. But for the U.S., our failure to sufficiently test enough people is representative of the many challenges we face.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/america-is-testing-for-covid-19-more-than-ever-and-it-still-isnt-enough/", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers"]}, {"title": "Voter Registrations Are Way, Way Down During The Pandemic", "text": "Poll after poll showed a high level of enthusiasm for voting in the general election in 2020, and in the beginning of the year, voter registration surged to match that excitement. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. New registrations have fallen off a cliff.\n\nThe spring of a presidential election year is often a busy time for adding new voters to the rolls, and a recent report from the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit organization that aims to improve voter turnout and election security, shows registration numbers were even stronger in early 2020 than early 2016. But things changed dramatically in March, at least in the 12 places where FiveThirtyEight or CEIR were able to obtain data on new voters, a category that includes first-time voters, voters who recently moved to the state and, in some states (Texas, for example) even voters who moved between counties in the state.\n\nConsider Florida, for example, where 109,859 new voters registered in February of this year, compared to 87,351 registrants in February of 2016. But in April 2020, only 21,031 new voters registered, compared with 52,508 in 2016. The same pattern holds in 10 other states, plus Washington, D.C.: Each one registered fewer new voters in April 2020 than in April 2016, including in states where online voter registration is available.\n\nCurrently, 39 states plus Washington, D.C., offer the ability to register to vote online, and a 40th (Oklahoma) is expected to implement it this year. However, in the three places for which we have the relevant data (Florida, Maryland and Washington), online voter registration has not taken off during the pandemic \u2014 certainly not enough to make up for the lost in-person registrations. Even in Washington, where online registrations have ticked up since the beginning of the year, the pace is comparable to 2016: 2,956 people registered online in April and May 2020, similar to the 2,771 people who registered online in April and May 2016.\n\nThe fact that new voter registrations were outpacing the 2016 numbers in January and February was predictable, according to David Becker, the executive director and founder of CEIR. For one thing, population growth means that voter registration always climbs a bit, he said. The expansion of automatic voter registration makes getting on the rolls more convenient than ever in many states, too. Voters were also clearly interested in registering, Becker said.\n\n\u201cEvery piece of data we had looked at with regard to enthusiasm about engaging in this presidential election cycle indicated that we had to be prepared for the highest-turnout presidential election that almost anyone living had ever seen,\u201d Becker said, \u201cwhich makes the decline in March and especially April all the more striking.\u201d\n\nBased on the timing, it seems safe to assume that COVID-19 had something to do with the drop-off, but there\u2019s data to back that assumption up, too. In addition to how many new voters register, some states track how these new voters get their name on the books. In 2016 and in the pre-pandemic months of 2020, in-person registration at places like departments of motor vehicles made up a large plurality, or even a majority, of new registrants in the four places for which we have data on how new voters are registering. But after the pandemic caused most states to shutter many government offices, those registrations dwindled. By contrast, remote registrations (e.g., online or by mail) held relatively steady.\n\n\u201cThis is completely expected, but very concerning,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cThe coronavirus shut down most of the primary avenues through which Americans register to vote: government offices, and all the malls, theaters and public places where voter registration drives operate.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the closing of schools and public events like festivals has hindered in-person voter registration drives run by third-party organizations. \u201cWe had planned to go to 850 high schools leading up to graduation, but as schools closed, that work was clearly disrupted,\u201d said Jeanette Senecal, a senior director for the League of Women Voters who focuses on voter education.\n\nFor example, in Florida, third-party organizations registered 14,144 voters in January 2020 \u2014 a huge increase from the 1,196 they registered in January 2016. But in April 2020, they registered only 133 voters \u2014 down from 3,806 in April 2016.\n\nStates and third-party groups can still get around social distancing restrictions to get more voters on the poll books, though. Voto Latino, an organization that works to register and encourage Latino Americans to vote, has been operating digitally almost since its inception and was well prepared to continue its work during a pandemic. It uses digital campaigns to help voters register, which can even work in states like Texas, which does not have online voter registration \u2014 Voto Latino created an app that makes it easy to fill out the required form, which is then emailed to the voter to print off and mail in.\n\nDanny Turkel, the communications manager for Voto Latino, said the group has actually seen a surge in voter registration, especially since protests in response to the killing of George Floyd began. \u201cOur original goal entering 2020 was to register 500,000 voters,\u201d said Turkel. \u201cAs the numbers have come in and surged, we are now thinking that we could surpass 500,000.\u201d\n\nSo what kind of people might have registered if the coronavirus hadn\u2019t struck? Well for one thing, they\u2019re probably disproportionately young. \u201cIn any given year, far more young people register than older people, just because 18-year-olds age in [to being able to vote] and young people are more likely to move\u201d and need to register at a new address, said Kevin Morris, a quantitative researcher focusing on voting rights and elections at the Brennan Center. According to Morris\u2019s data, 57 percent of new registrants in Florida in the first four months of 2016 were under the age of 40, as were 65 percent of new registrants in Georgia. While the proportions were similar in the beginning of 2020, the total number was much lower than in the past, which means that lots of young people aren\u2019t registering as usual in at least two key 2020 swing states.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew voter registrations have nosedived during COVID-19\n\nSome of these delayed registrants may never end up registering at all. Though we don\u2019t have data for how a pandemic has affected registration in the past (since the U.S. hasn\u2019t faced a similar situation for a good century), Weiser cited another instance when voter registration dipped due to extenuating circumstances. In May of 2011, Florida passed a new bill that placed tough restrictions on third-party voter registration organizations, prompting many of them, such as the League of Women Voters, to stop operating in the state. The restrictions were suspended by a judge in May 2012 but the damage had been done; a subsequent study found that about 14 percent fewer voters registered in 2011 compared to the same period in 2007, with a notable drop following the introduction of the bill \u2014 and those registrations never completely caught up. In 2008, more than 1 million new voters registered in Florida. In 2012, fewer than 900,000 did, according to the state\u2019s voter registration data.\n\nOf course, one unusual law in Florida isn\u2019t exactly analogous to a pandemic, and it\u2019s possible that the high level of enthusiasm for this election will be enough to close the gap that COVID-19 created, especially as states begin to reopen and voters return to registration sites like the DMV. So it\u2019s difficult to know whether this drop in registrations is permanent. But it is clear that despite voters\u2019 intense interest in this election, the coronavirus has already made it harder for new voters to participate in it.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-registrations-are-way-way-down-during-the-pandemic", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers", "Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "It\u2019s Time To Give Basketball\u2019s Other GOAT Her Due", "text": "ESPN recently finished airing a 10-part documentary, \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d that gave Michael Jordan the last word on his career narrative, solidifying his place atop the NBA\u2019s GOAT hierarchy. And by the numbers, that\u2019s exactly where MJ belongs. But now it\u2019s time to give some love to another hoops GOAT, this one on the women\u2019s side: former Houston Comets guard Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. (She went by Cynthia Cooper during her playing career, but she uses her married name now.) At the same time that Jordan\u2019s last dance was playing out, Cooper-Dyke was dominating the WNBA just like Mike was the NBA \u2014 establishing a statistical record that still hasn\u2019t been surpassed.\n\nCooper-Dyke, who\u2019s now the coach of the Texas Southern women\u2019s basketball team, had been a good player in college at Southern California in the mid-1980s, averaging 17.2 points a contest in her senior season. But she was often overshadowed by teammates Cheryl Miller and Pam and Paula McGee, all of whom were named All-Americans (an honor Cooper-Dyke never received) as part of a dominating Trojans team that went 114-15, won two championships and visited another NCAA final during Cooper-Dyke\u2019s career.\n\nMiller was often regarded as the Michael Jordan of women\u2019s basketball by the time she finished her storied career, and Cooper-Dyke sometimes chafed in her shadow. \u201cThere was always this friction/competition between Cheryl and I,\u201d Cooper-Dyke said in \u201cWomen of Troy,\u201d an HBO documentary about USC\u2019s \u201980s dynasty. \u201cI think she had something to prove, and I definitely had a chip on my shoulder having to prove to her and everyone watching that, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m kind of talented too.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Cooper-Dyke\u2019s skills were evident even then, particularly when she was named to the NCAA\u2019s All-Tournament team in 1986 after averaging 19.0 points per game on 54.3 percent shooting during USC\u2019s journey to the championship game.\n\nBecause of the lack of professional opportunities for women\u2019s players at the time \u2014 the WNBA wouldn\u2019t exist for another 11 years after Cooper-Dyke left college \u2014 Cooper-Dyke had to play in Europe, bouncing between teams in Spain and Italy for a decade while producing some incredible stats along the way. In her lone season with Samoa Betera, for instance, Cooper-Dyke led the Spanish league in scoring with 45 points per game, according to her autobiography. She had unlocked a part of her game that had been lurking under the surface at USC.\n\n\u201cI was pumped,\u201d Cooper-Dyke wrote. \u201cNot only was it my first professional experience, but it was the first time I had been a go-to player. I finally had my first real opportunity to showcase my talent. I was ready to shout \u2014 \u2018Hey! Look at me. I\u2019m on the scene.\u2019\u201d\n\nCooper-Dyke would go on to lead her league in scoring eight times during her 10 years overseas, never finishing any lower than second. She also won a variety of gold medals for Team USA, including at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. By the beginning of 1997, when the was WNBA preparing a list of players for its inaugural allocation draft, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s exploits in Europe were enough put her in the initial group of 16 franchise players used to seed the league\u2019s eight teams \u2014 along with superstars such as Lisa Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes, Teresa Weatherspoon and Rebecca Lobo.\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown\n\nStill, Cooper-Dyke was somewhat unknown to American fans on the eve of the WNBA\u2019s debut. \u201cNobody was following what was going on overseas, but she was dominating the Italian league, [she was] the leading scorer, won championships,\u201d Hall of Famer Ticha Penicheiro said in a WNBA feature on Cooper-Dyke. \u201cPeople just didn\u2019t know about her.\u201d\n\nThat changed in a hurry during the WNBA\u2019s initial season. Cooper-Dyke was instantly and obviously the new league\u2019s best player: She won MVP honors while leading the Comets to the league\u2019s best record and the first-ever WNBA championship. She also swept the league\u2019s advanced-stats leaderboard, finishing No. 1 in player efficiency rating, win shares and win shares per 40 minutes. According to a composite mix of PER and WS/40 designed to mimic our RAPTOR NBA ratings, Cooper-Dyke added 10.6 points per 100 possessions more than average to Houston\u2019s league-leading +8.7 net rating, carrying the Comets while Swoopes missed the majority of the season after giving birth to her son.\n\nCooper-Dyke did it all at 34, too \u2014 well past the prime age for basketball players. It makes you wonder what feats she might have accomplished if the WNBA had existed just a decade earlier. And as great as Cooper-Dyke was in the WNBA\u2019s first season, she was even better in Year 2. In 1998, she once again:\n\nWith apologies to recent accomplishments of Elena Delle Donne and Nneka Ogwumike, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s 1998 may have been the best single-season performance in WNBA history. In terms of composite rating, it trails only Lauren Jackson\u2019s 2006 among seasons of at least 375 minutes:\n\nCooper-Dyke\u2019s early WNBA seasons are among the best ever Best single-season composite ratings \u2014 based on a mix of player efficiency rating (PER) and win shares per 40 minutes \u2014 for WNBA players who played at least 375 minutes that season, 1997-2019 Player Season Age Team PER WS/40 Composite Rating Lauren Jackson 2006 25 SEA 34.7 .416 +11.5 Cynthia Cooper 1998 35 HOU 31.1 .382 +10.7 Cynthia Cooper 1997 34 HOU 32.2 .385 +10.6 Sheryl Swoopes 2000 29 HOU 32.0 .361 +10.5 Lauren Jackson 2007 26 SEA 35.0 .373 +10.4 Nneka Ogwumike 2016 25 LAS 31.3 .370 +10.3 Sylvia Fowles 2017 31 MIN 30.8 .350 +10.0 Elena Delle Donne 2019 29 WAS 31.8 .343 +9.9 Elena Delle Donne 2015 25 CHI 32.8 .346 +9.4 Lauren Jackson 2003 22 SEA 32.1 .333 +9.2 Cynthia Cooper 1999 36 HOU 29.5 .335 +9.2 Yolanda Griffith 1999 29 SAC 31.9 .330 +9.1 Lauren Jackson 2010 29 SEA 27.9 .333 +8.8 Tamika Catchings 2007 27 IND 29.4 .325 +8.6 Nneka Ogwumike 2017 26 LAS 28.1 .321 +8.5 Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nJackson didn\u2019t play as much as Cooper-Dyke did, and Jackson\u2019s team didn\u2019t have nearly as much success in 2006 as Houston did in 1998. Cooper-Dyke\u2019s performance came while logging 35 minutes per game for a team that still holds the record for highest single-season winning percentage (.900) in league history. That season, Cooper-Dyke had as thorough a stranglehold on the WNBA as MJ ever had on the NBA in any of his seasons. (And again, she did it at the ripe old age of 35!)\n\nIn 1999, Cooper-Dyke was still dominant, leading the league in win shares (overall and per 40) and composite rating \u2014 although Sacramento\u2019s Yolanda Griffith wrested away the PER crown and MVP honors. The Comets won their third consecutive WNBA title, however, with Cooper-Dyke once again earning Finals MVP honors. It continued a Jordanesque stretch that helped solidify Cooper-Dyke\u2019s place in history as the WNBA\u2019s GOAT.\n\nAnd then, in 2000, the Comets had the most impressive run in the history of women\u2019s pro basketball.\n\nAt age 37, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s individual stats were beginning to decline. She ranked third on the team in composite rating (+6.3) behind Swoopes (+10.5) \u2014 who had fully come into her own as a dominating superstar, winning MVP honors \u2014 and Tina Thompson (+6.5). But the 2000 Comets were the best version of their dynasty teams. After a 27-5 regular season, Houston blazed through the playoffs without losing a single game, as Cooper-Dyke won Finals MVP for a fourth consecutive season with 22.5 points and 6 assists per game against the New York Liberty.\n\nWe can measure Houston\u2019s rise from a new team to a legendary four-time WNBA champion using Elo ratings, a FiveThirtyEight staple. Before each game, Elo assigns each team a rating that essentially represents their current strength; those ratings (after incorporating home-court advantage and other factors) can be turned into win probabilities for both teams. After the game, the ratings are then adjusted based on the result, with the winner gaining Elo points in proportion to how unexpected the victory was. This spring, my colleague Jay Boice created Elo ratings for the WNBA, which follow the same general framework as our other Elo ratings from the NBA and other sports.\n\nAccording to Elo, the 2000 Houston Comets peaked with a rating of 1743 after completing their sweep of the Liberty, which, even two decades later, is still the highest rating ever achieved by a WNBA team.\n\nSadly, the Comets no longer exist, having folded in 2008. But their legacy as the GOAT lives on. The closest any recent WNBA teams have come to matching the Comets\u2019 peak Elo were the 2014 Phoenix Mercury, who topped out at 1736 after sweeping the Sky for the championship, and the 2017 Los Angeles Sparks, who reached a 1729 Elo when they took a 2-1 lead over the Minnesota Lynx in the Finals. (L.A. would go on to lose its next two games \u2014 and the series.) Delle Donne\u2019s 2019 Washington Mystics were the best offensive team in WNBA history, but in terms of Elo, their peak was just 1717, nowhere near the Comets\u2019 best mark.\n\nIn retrospect, Houston was lucky to have randomly drawn both Cooper-Dyke and Swoopes in the WNBA\u2019s initial allocation draft, and then to have taken Thompson No. 1 overall in the regular 1997 draft \u2014 it instantly gave the Comets a trio of all-time legends from the very start. With all three playing to their full potential, surrounded by solid role players like Janeth Arcain, Kim Perrot and Monica Lamb, it\u2019s no wonder that Houston blossomed into a historic dynasty.\n\nBut at the center of it all was Cooper-Dyke, who retired after that 2000 season at the top of the basketball world (before making a brief, four-game comeback in 2003). To this day, she remains the WNBA\u2019s all-time leader in PER (28.7), win shares per 40 (.335) and composite rating (+9.0), with Jackson and Delle Donne distantly tied behind her at +7.3. Statistically, Cooper-Dyke is the best ever on a per-possession basis, and it isn\u2019t particularly close:\n\nCooper-Dyke dominated each and every possession Best composite ratings \u2014 based on a mix of player efficiency rating (PER) and win shares per 40 minutes \u2014 for WNBA players with at least 2,250 career minutes played, 1997-2019 Player Games Minutes PER WS/40 Composite Rating Cynthia Cooper 124 4,363 28.7 .335 +9.0 Elena Delle Donne 190 5,900 28.7 .289 +7.3 Lauren Jackson 317 10,130 28.0 .288 +7.3 Nneka Ogwumike 250 7,309 25.8 .267 +6.4 Yolanda Griffith 311 8,956 25.4 .265 +6.3 Tamika Catchings 457 14,387 26.1 .260 +6.1 Jonquel Jones 136 3,126 25.0 .254 +6.0 Maya Moore 271 8,466 24.6 .253 +6.0 Sylvia Fowles 340 10,387 25.2 .240 +5.6 Breanna Stewart 101 3,339 25.3 .225 +5.2 Candace Parker 315 9,836 25.3 .216 +4.9 Liz Cambage 117 2,910 26.5 .207 +4.7 Brittney Griner 212 6,481 24.8 .213 +4.7 Lisa Leslie 363 11,634 24.3 .206 +4.6 Sheryl Swoopes 324 10,591 23.3 .212 +4.5 Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nCooper-Dyke is the only four-time (or even three-time) Finals MVP in league history, and she is still the only back-to-back league MVP winner. She led the greatest dynasty in WNBA history, rising from a relative unknown plying her trade in Europe to become the top player in women\u2019s hoops.\n\nIt\u2019s a great story. In fact, now that Jordan\u2019s film is in the books, and once they finish telling Tom Brady\u2019s tale, maybe Cooper-Dyke should be the subject of ESPN\u2019s next documentary about GOAT athletes.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-time-to-give-basketballs-other-goat-her-due/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "We\u2019ve Updated Our Pollster Ratings Ahead Of The 2020 General Election", "text": "The competitive phase of the 2020 presidential primaries is over \u2014 which means we\u2019ve updated FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings. These ratings cover this year\u2019s presidential primaries, the 2019 gubernatorial elections and the occasional straggler poll we only just discovered from a past election. They include polls conducted in the final 21 days before every presidential, U.S. Senate, U.S. House and gubernatorial general election (including special elections), as well as every presidential primary, since 1998. We encourage you to check out the new ratings, especially when a new poll comes out and you want to gauge its reliability.\n\nSo far, it hasn\u2019t been a great year for pollsters. The 2020 presidential primary polls had a weighted average error \u2014 i.e., the absolute difference between a poll\u2019s margin (between the top two candidates) and the actual vote share margin \u2014 of 10.2 percentage points. That\u2019s roughly tied with the 2016 presidential primaries for the biggest error in primary polling this century.\n\nBut we don\u2019t blame pollsters too much for this: They have some good excuses because the 2020 Democratic primary race changed so quickly. In the span of a week (from roughly Feb. 25 to Super Tuesday), former Vice President Joe Biden dramatically reversed his electoral fortunes, and surveys just weren\u2019t able to keep up with how fast the mood of the electorate was changing. We can see that by breaking down the error of 2020 primary polls by election date:\n\nPolls of the contests on Super Tuesday had a weighted average error of 12.8 points, with 60 percent of them conducted mostly before Biden\u2019s big South Carolina win and subsequent endorsements by onetime 2020 presidential contenders former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nSouth Carolina polls had a weighted average error of 17.2 points (!), and 75 percent of them were conducted mostly before Rep. Jim Clyburn\u2019s endorsement of Biden.\n\nPolls of all other contests \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and every post-Super Tuesday state \u2014 had a weighted average error of 7.1 points, which is quite good by historical standards for primary polls.\n\nOne week torpedoed the 2020 primary polls Weighted average error of polls in the final 21 days* before each contest, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Contest Error Iowa 5.3 New Hampshire 4.9 Nevada 8.8 South Carolina 17.2 Super Tuesday 12.8 March 10 9.7 March 17 6.6 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular election date. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *Excluding New Hampshire primary polls taken before the Iowa caucuses, other states\u2019 primary polls taken before the New Hampshire primary, and primary polls whose leader or runner-up dropped out before that primary was held.\n\nIn addition, some pollsters fared better in the 2020 primaries than others. We\u2019d encourage you not to read too much into a pollster\u2019s performance in the 2020 primaries, as it typically takes a larger sample size to ascertain a pollster\u2019s true accuracy. But if there was a \u201cwinner\u201d for the 2020 primaries, it was Monmouth University, whose average error of 7.5 points was the lowest among firms that released five or more primary polls. Probably not by coincidence, Monmouth also has the highest FiveThirtyEight pollster rating overall \u2014 a sterling A+.\n\nIn general, pollsters that use the time-honored methodology of interviewing respondents live over the phone are more reliable than those that use alternative platforms like the internet, and that was mostly true in the 2020 primaries too. Suffolk University, another live-caller pollster, also performed pretty well (an average error of 8.0), although Marist College had an off year (13.3). Among online pollsters, YouGov \u2014 whose online methodology is more proven than most \u2014 excelled with a 7.6-point error, almost matching Monmouth\u2019s accuracy. The pollster with the highest average error (at least among those with five or more polls to analyze) was Change Research, at 16.1 points.\n\nThe best and worst pollsters of the 2020 primaries Average error of polls in the final 21 days* before 2020 presidential primaries and caucuses, for pollsters that conducted at least five polls, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Pollster Methodology No. of Polls Average Error Monmouth University Live 7 7.5 YouGov Online 9 7.6 Suffolk University Live 6 8.0 Emerson College IVR/Online/Text 13 8.5 AtlasIntel Online 8 8.8 Data for Progress Online/Text 29 9.3 Point Blank Political Online/Text 6 10.7 Swayable Online 22 12.0 Marist College Live 6 13.3 University of Massachusetts Lowell Online 6 14.0 Change Research Online 7 16.1 *Excluding New Hampshire primary polls taken before the Iowa caucuses, other states\u2019 primary polls taken before the New Hampshire primary, and primary polls whose leader or runner-up dropped out before that primary was held.\n\nFinally, as is our custom when updating the pollster ratings, let\u2019s take a look at the accuracy of polls as a whole through three different lenses \u2014 error, \u201ccalling\u201d elections correctly and statistical bias \u2014 each with an accompanying heat map.\n\nThe first lens is polling error \u2014 a.k.a. the same metric we\u2019ve been using so far in this article. Here\u2019s the weighted average error of polls for each election cycle since 1998, broken down by office. We already mentioned how polls of the 2020 primaries were not all that accurate historically speaking. But the limited polls we have for governor and U.S. House races this cycle have been pretty accurate so far. They had weighted average errors of 4.9 and 6.0, respectively, which is perfectly normal for these types of elections, although the sample size is still quite small.\n\n2020 primary polls misfired, but the polls are still all right Weighted average error of polls in the final 21 days before elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database President Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 8.2 7.5 7.1 7.7 1999-2000 4.8 6.1 4.4 4.4 7.7 5.6 2001-02 5.2 4.8 5.5 5.2 2003-04 4.8 5.0 5.5 3.2 6.9 4.6 2005-06 5.0 4.2 6.2 5.2 2007-08 4.2 4.7 5.7 3.5 7.6 5.4 2009-10 4.8 4.8 6.7 5.7 2011-12 4.9 4.7 5.3 3.7 9.0 5.3 2013-14 4.6 5.4 6.7 5.4 2015-16 5.4 4.9 5.8 4.9 10.3 6.8 2017-18 5.1 4.3 5.0 4.9 2019-20* 4.9 TBD 6.0 TBD 10.2 TBD All years 5.3 5.2 6.1 4.0 9.3 6.0 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential general elections to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nQuantifying polling error is arguably the best way to think about the accuracy of polls, but there are other lenses too. But say all you care about is whether polls \u201ccalled\u201d the election correctly \u2014 i.e., how often the candidate who led a poll ended up winning the election. We\u2019ve got a heat map for that too (although this isn\u2019t our preferred method, as it\u2019s a bit simplistic). Overall, since 1998, polls have picked the winner 79 percent of the time. And by this measure, the accuracy of 2020 primary polls clocked in at exactly average.\n\nPolls pick the winner 79 percent of the time Weighted average share of polls that correctly identified the winner in the final 21 days before elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database President Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 86% 87% 49% 76% 1999-2000 81 84 54 67% 95% 76 2001-02 87 82 73 81 2003-04 76 82 64 79 94 79 2005-06 89 92 73 84 2007-08 95 95 84 94 79 88 2009-10 85 85 77 82 2011-12 91 87 70 82 62 77 2013-14 80 75 76 77 2015-16 68 78 58 71 86 77 2017-18 74 74 79 75 2019-20* 88 TBD 41 TBD 79 TBD All years 82 83 72 79 81 79 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential general elections to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nFrankly, though, this isn\u2019t a great way to think about polls. Say a poll had the Republican ahead by 1 point but the Democrat ended up winning the election by 1 point \u2014 that\u2019s a pretty accurate result even though the winner was incorrectly identified. On the other hand, if the Republican ended up winning by 20 points, the poll did correctly identify the winner \u2014 but the absolute error was quite large.\n\nAdditionally, polls of close elections unsurprisingly make the wrong call much more frequently than races where there is no doubt which candidate is going to win. In both the 2020 primaries and overall, polls showing a blowout (i.e., the leader led by 20 points or more) picked the correct winner almost all the time, but they were right only about half the time when they showed a lead smaller than 3 points.\n\nPolls often miss close races Share of polls that correctly identified the winner in the final 21 days before elections, by how close the poll showed the race % of Polls Picking Winner Margin 2020 Primaries All Races Since 1998 <3 pts 46% 57% 3-6 72 70 6-10 79 84 10-15 75 93 15-20 82 97 \u226520 98 99 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nThis is why, when a poll shows a close race, your takeaway shouldn\u2019t be, \u201cThis candidate leads by 1 point!\u201d but rather, \u201cThis race is a toss-up.\u201d Polls\u2019 true utility isn\u2019t in telling us who will win, but rather in roughly how close a race is \u2014 and, therefore, how confident we should be in the outcome.\n\nThe third and final lens we\u2019ll use is polls\u2019 statistical bias. Statistical bias is different from error in that it tells us in which direction the error ran \u2014 i.e., did the polls consistently under- or overrate a specific political party? Not much has changed in this final table since the last time we published it, because we exclude presidential primaries from calculations of statistical bias (since all primary candidates belong to the same party), but we think it\u2019s worth reemphasizing its findings as we enter the 2020 general election.\n\nPolling bias is small and unpredictable Weighted average statistical bias of polls in the final 21 days before general elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House President Combined 1998 R+5.6 R+4.5 R+0.8 R+3.8 1999-2000 R+0.4 R+2.7 D+1.2 R+2.4 R+1.9 2001-02 D+3.0 D+1.3 D+1.5 D+2.2 2003-04 D+1.7 D+1.1 D+2.7 D+1.1 D+1.5 2005-06 D+0.2 R+1.3 D+0.7 D+0.0 2007-08 R+0.1 D+0.4 D+1.1 D+1.0 D+0.8 2009-10 R+0.1 R+0.7 D+1.7 D+0.6 2011-12 R+1.6 R+3.1 R+2.9 R+2.5 R+2.8 2013-14 D+2.3 D+2.6 D+3.8 D+2.7 2015-16 D+3.3 D+2.7 D+4.1 D+3.3 D+3.0 2017-18 R+0.9 D+0.1 R+0.6 R+0.5 2019-20* D+2.9 TBD D+6.0 TBD TBD All years D+0.5 D+0.1 D+0.8 D+0.3 D+0.3 Bias is calculated only for elections where the top two finishers were a Republican and a Democrat. Therefore, it is not calculated for presidential primaries. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential races to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nThose findings: Over the long term, there is no meaningful partisan statistical bias in polling. All the polls in our data set combine for a weighted average statistical bias of 0.3 points toward Democrats. Individual election cycles can have more significant biases \u2014 and, importantly, it usually runs in the same direction for every office \u2014 but there is no pattern from year to year. In other words, just because polls overestimated Democrats in 2016 does not mean they will do the same in 2020. It\u2019s good to be aware of the potential for polling error heading into the election, but that error could benefit either party. In fact, we\u2019ve observed that preelection attempts to guess which way the polling error will run seem to have an uncanny knack for being wrong \u2014 which could be a coincidence or could reflect very real overcompensation.\n\nSo despite a rocky primary season, we recommend that you trust the polls in 2020. Of course, \u201ctrust the polls\u201d doesn\u2019t mean trust all the polls; that\u2019s why we have our pollster ratings. In addition to our handy letter grades, that page contains each pollster\u2019s average error, statistical bias and the share of races it called correctly, plus details on whether it adheres to methodological best practices and a lot more. You can also download our entire pollster ratings data set, including all the polls that went into the tables in this article, to investigate further on your own. (Wondering how much more accurate live-caller polls are than online ones? Or which state\u2019s polls are the most error-prone? Wonder no more.)\n\nFor a detailed methodology of the pollster ratings, check out this 2014 article; we made a few tweaks in 2016 and 2019, such as giving a \u201cslashed\u201d letter grade (e.g., \u201cA/B\u201d) to pollsters with a smaller body of work. There are no methodological changes this year, except we do have a bit of housekeeping that probably only pollsters will be interested in: Starting with our next pollster ratings update (after the 2020 elections), we will no longer give active pollsters a ratings boost for once belonging to the National Council on Public Polls (a now-defunct polling consortium whose members were committed to methodological transparency). Active pollsters will need to participate in the American Association for Public Opinion Research\u2019s Transparency Initiative or contribute to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archive to get credit in the \u201cNCPP/AAPOR/Roper\u201d column, which also determines which pollsters we consider \u201cgold standard.\u201d As always, if anyone has any questions about any aspect of the pollster ratings, you can always reach us at polls@fivethirtyeight.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Does Trump Really Want A Fight With Obama?", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weve-updated-our-pollster-ratings-ahead-of-the-2020-general-election/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "The State Of The Polls, 2019", "text": "The State Of The Polls, 2019 Polls just had one of their best election cycles, ever \u2014 but challenges abound in the industry\n\nMuch maligned for their performance in the 2016 general election \u2014 and somewhat unfairly so, since the overall accuracy of the polls was only slightly below average that year by historical standards \u2014 American election polls have been quite accurate since then.

Polls have also generally been accurate in the various special elections and off-year gubernatorial elections that have occurred since 2016, even though those are also often difficult races to poll.\n\n[Related: FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings]\n\nDoes that mean everything is looking up in the industry? Well, no. We\u2019ll introduce some complications in a moment. But I do want to re-emphasize that opening takeaway, since the media is just flatly wrong when it asserts that the polls can\u2019t be trusted. In fact, American election polls are about as accurate as they\u2019ve always been. That doesn\u2019t mean polls will always identify the right winner, especially in close elections. (As a simple rule of thumb, we\u2019ve found polls \u201ccall\u201d the right winner 80 percent of the time, meaning they fail to do so the other 20 percent of the time \u2014 although upsets are more likely to occur in some circumstances than others.) But the rate of upsets hasn\u2019t changed much over time.\n\nBefore we go any further, I want to direct you to the latest version of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings, which we\u2019ve updated for the first time since May 2018. They include all polls in the three weeks leading up to every U.S. House, U.S. Senate and gubernatorial general election since then, including special elections, plus a handful of polls from past years that were missing from previous versions of our database. You can find much more detail on the pollster ratings here, including all the polls used in the ratings calculation. Our presidential approval ratings, generic congressional ballot and impeachment trackers have also been updated to reflect these new ratings, although they make little difference to the topline numbers.\n\nNow then, for those complications: The main one is simply that response rates to traditional telephone polls continue to decline. In large part because of caller-ID and call-blocking technologies, it\u2019s simply harder than it used to be to get people to answer phone calls from people they don\u2019t know. In addition to potentially making polls less accurate, that also makes them more expensive, since a pollster has to spend more time making calls for every completed response that it gets. As a result, the overall number of polls has begun to slightly decline. There were 532 polls in our pollster ratings database, which covers polls in the 21 days before elections occur, associated with elections on Nov. 6, 2018, which is down from 558 polls for Election Day 2014 and 692 polls for Election Day 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The races we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching on Election Day 2019\n\nSo why not turn to online polls or other new technologies? Well, the problem is that in recent elections, polls that use live interviewers to call both landlines and cellphones continue to outperform other methods, such as online and automated (IVR) polls. Moreover, online and IVR polls are generally more prone toward herding \u2014 that is, making methodological choices, or picking and choosing which results they publish, in ways that make their polls match other, more traditional polls. So not only are online and automated polls somewhat less accurate than live-caller polls, but they\u2019d probably suffer a further decline in accuracy if they didn\u2019t have live polls to herd toward.\n\nStill, online polling is undoubtedly a large part of polling\u2019s future \u2014 and some online polling firms are more accurate than others. Among the most prolific online pollsters, for example, YouGov stands out for being more accurate than others such as Zogby, SurveyMonkey, and Harris Insights & Analytics. And many former IVR pollsters are now migrating to hybrid methods that combine automated phone polling with internet panels. In the 2018 elections, this produced better results in some cases (e.g., SurveyUSA) than in others (e.g., Rasmussen Reports).\n\nPolls have been quite accurate \u2014 and unbiased \u2014 in post-2016 elections\n\nEach time we update our pollster ratings, we publish a few charts that depict the overall health of the industry \u2014 so let\u2019s go ahead and run the numbers again. The first chart is the one we consider to be the most important: the average error of polls broken down by the type of election. A few quick methodological notes:\n\nBy average error, I mean the difference between the margin projected by the poll and the actual election result. For instance, if the poll shows the Democrat up by 1 percentage point and the Republican wins by 2 points, that would be a 3-point error.\n\nTo not give any one polling firm too much influence, the values in the chart are weighted based on the number of polls a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle\n\nPolls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect that they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nNote that I\u2019ve included the handful of elections that have occurred so far in 2019 with the 2017-18 election cycle, even though we\u2019ll classify them them later as part of the 2019-20 cycle instead.\n\nOK, here\u2019s the data:\n\nPost-2016 polls have been accurate by historical standards Weighted-average error of polls in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Presidential Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 8.2 7.4 6.8 7.6 1999-2000 4.9 6.1 4.4 4.4 7.6 5.5 2001-02 5.2 4.9 5.4 5.2 2003-04 6.0 5.6 5.4 3.2 7.1 4.8 2005-06 5.0 4.2 6.5 5.3 2007-08 4.1 4.7 5.7 3.6 7.4 5.4 2009-10 4.9 4.8 6.9 5.7 2011-12 4.9 4.7 5.1 3.6 8.9 5.2 2013-14 4.6 5.5 6.5 5.4 2015-16 5.4 5.0 5.5 4.8 10.1 6.7 2017-19 5.3 4.3 5.0 5.0 All years 5.4 5.3 6.1 4.0 8.7 5.8 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nAs I said, the 2017-19 cycle was one of the most accurate on record for polling. The average error of 5.0 points in polls of U.S. House elections is the second-best in our database, trailing only 1999-2000. The 4.3-point error associated with U.S. Senate elections is also the second-best, slightly trailing 2005-06. And gubernatorial polls had an average error of 5.3 points, which is about average by historical standards.\n\nCombining all different types of elections together, we find that polls from 2017 onward have been associated with an average error of 5.0 points, which is considerably better than the 6.7-point average for 2015-16, and the best in any election cycle since 2003-04.\n\nBut note that there\u2019s just not much of an overall trajectory \u2014 upward or downward \u2014 in polling accuracy. Relatively strong cycles for the polls can be followed by relatively weak ones, and vice versa.\n\nOne more key reminder now that the Iowa caucuses are only three months away: Some types of elections are associated with considerably larger polling errors than others. In particular, presidential primaries feature polling that is often volatile at best, and downright inaccurate at worst. Overall, presidential primary polls in our database mispredict the final margin between the top two candidates by an average of 8.7 points. And the error was even worse, 10.1 points, in the 2016 primary cycle. Leads of 10 points, 15 points or sometimes more are not necessarily safe in the primaries.\n\nWe can also look at polling accuracy by simply counting up how often the candidate leading in the poll wins his or her race. This isn\u2019t our preferred method, as it\u2019s a bit simplistic \u2014 if a poll had the Republican ahead by 1 point and the Democrat won by 1 point, that\u2019s a much more accurate result than if the Republican had won by 20, even though it would have incorrectly identified the winner. But across all polls in our database, the winner was \u201ccalled\u201d 79 percent of the time.\n\nPolls \u201ccall\u201d the winner right 79 percent of the time Weighted-average share of polls that correctly identified the winner in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Presidential Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 86% 86% 57% 78% 1999-2000 80 80 56 68% 95% 76 2001-2002 87 87 77 82 2003-2004 76 76 69 78 94 79 2005-2006 89 89 71 83 2007-2008 95 95 83 94 80 88 2009-2010 85 85 75 82 2011-2012 90 90 70 81 63 77 2013-2014 80 80 76 77 2015-2016 68 68 57 71 86 77 2017-2019 77 77 78 76 All years 82 82 72 79 83 79 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nIn recent elections, the winning percentage has been slightly below the long-term average \u2014 it was 76 percent in 2017-19. But this reflects the recent uptick in close elections, and that resource-constrained pollsters tend to poll these close elections more heavily.\n\nAs basic as this analysis is, it\u2019s essential to remember that polls are much more likely to misidentify the winner when they show a close race. Polls in our database that showed a lead of 3 percentage points or less identified the winner only 58 percent of the time \u2014 a bit better than random chance, but not much better. But polls showing a 3- or 6-point lead were right 72 percent of the time, and those with a 6- or 10-point lead were right 86 percent of the time. (Errors in races showing double-digit leads are quite rare in general elections, although they occur with some frequency in primaries. And errors in races where one candidate leads by 20 or more points are once-in-a-blue-moon types of events, regardless of the type of election.)\n\nPolls often misidentify the winner in a close race Share of polls that correctly identified the winner in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Leading candidate\u2019s margin Share of polls correctly identifying winner 0-3 points 58% \u2013 \u2013 3-6 points 72 \u2013 \u2013 6-10 points 86 \u2013 \u2013 10-15 points 94 \u2013 \u2013 15-20 points 98 \u2013 \u2013 \u226520 points >99 \u2013 \u2013 Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nAnother essential measure of polling accuracy is statistical bias \u2014 that is, whether the polls tend to miss in the same direction. We\u2019re particularly interested in understanding whether polls systematically favor Democrats or Republicans. Take the polls in 2016, for instance. Although they weren\u2019t that bad from an accuracy standpoint, the majority underestimated President Trump and Republicans running for Congress and governor, leading them to underestimate how well Trump would do in the Electoral College. Overall in the 2015-16 cycle, polls had a Democratic bias (meaning they overestimated Democrats and underestimated Republicans) of 3.0 percentage points. And that after a 2013-14 cycle when polls also had a Democratic bias (of 2.7 percentage points).\n\nPolling bias is not very consistent from cycle to cycle Weighted-average statistical bias of polls in final 21 days of the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House Pres.

Therefore, it is not calculated for presidential primaries. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nIn 2017-19, however, polls had essentially no partisan bias, and to the extent there was one, it was a very slight bias toward Republicans (0.3 percentage points). And that\u2019s been the long-term pattern: Whatever bias there is in one batch of election polls doesn\u2019t tend to persist from one cycle to the next. The Republican bias in the polls in 2011-12, for instance, which tended to underestimate then-President Obama\u2019s re-election margins, was followed by two cycles of Democratic bias in 2013-14 and 2015-16, as previously mentioned. There is simply not much point in trying to guess the direction of poll bias ahead of time; if anything, it often seems to go against what the conventional wisdom expects. Instead, you should always be prepared for the possibility of systematic polling errors of several percentage points in either direction.\n\nWhich pollsters have been most accurate in recent elections?\n\nAlthough it can be dangerous to put too much stock in the performance of a pollster in a single election cycle \u2014 it takes dozens of polls to reliably assess a pollster\u2019s accuracy \u2014 it\u2019s nonetheless worth briefly remarking on the recent performance of some of the more prolific ones. Below, you\u2019ll find the average error, statistical bias and a calculation we call Advanced Plus-Minus (basically, how the pollster\u2019s average error compares to other pollsters\u2019 in the same election), for pollsters with at least five polls in our database for the 2017-19 cycle. Note that negative Advanced Plus-Minus scores are good; they indicate that a firm\u2019s polls were more accurate than others in the same races.\n\nHow prolific pollsters have fared in recent elections Advanced Plus-Minus scores and other metrics for pollsters who conducted at least five surveys for the 2017-19 cycle, in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Pollster Methodology No. of Polls Avg.

In exciting news for fans of innovative polling, the list includes polls from our friends at The New York Times\u2019s Upshot, who launched an extremely successful and accurate polling collaboration with Siena College in 2016. (It also includes ABC News, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s corporate parent, which usually conducts its polls jointly with The Washington Post.)\n\nConversely, the five of the top six worst-performing pollsters \u2014 including firms such as Carroll Strategies, Dixie Strategies, and Rasmussen Reports/Pulse Opinion Research \u2014 were IVR pollsters (sometimes in conjunction with other methods), several of which had strong Republican leans in 2017-19. Some IVR pollsters did perform reasonably well in 2015-16, a cycle where most pollsters underestimated Republicans. In retrospect, though, that may have been a case of two wrongs making a right; IVR polls tend to be Republican-leaning, so they\u2019ll look good in years where Republicans beat their polls, but they\u2019ll often be among the worst polls otherwise.\n\nIndeed, aggregating the pollsters by methodology confirms that live caller polls continue to be the most accurate. Below are the aggregate scores for the three major categories of polls \u2014 live caller, online, and IVR \u2014 by our Advanced Plus-Minus metric, average error and statistical bias.\n\nLive-caller polls have been most accurate in recent elections Advanced Plus-Minus scores and other metrics for pollsters who conducted at least five surveys for the 2017-19 cycle, in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Methodology No. of Polls Avg.

Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nThe differences are clearest when looking at pollsters that exclusively used one method. Polls that exclusively used live callers (including calling cellphones) had an average error of 4.4 percentage points in the 2017-19 cycle, as compared to 5.0 points for polls exclusively conducted online or via text message, and 6.9 points for polls that exclusively used IVR. (Pure IVR polls, however, are now quite rare. Polls that used a hybrid of IVR and other methods did better, with an average error of 5.0 percentage points.)\n\nPolling firms that are members of professional polling organizations that push for transparency and other best practices also continue to outperform those that aren\u2019t. In particular, our pollster ratings give credit to firms that support the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Transparency Initiative, belong to the National Council on Public Polls (NCPP), or contribute data to the Roper Center archive. Pollsters that are part of one or more of these initiatives had an average error of 4.3 percentage points in the 2017-19 cycle, as compared to 5.4 percentage points for those that aren\u2019t.\n\nAnother way to detect herding\n\nOur pollster ratings have also long included an adjustment to account for the fact that online and automated polls tend to perform better when there are high-quality polls in the field. We\u2019ve confirmed that this still applies. For instance, polls that are conducted online or via IVR are about 0.4 percentage points more accurate based on our Advanced Plus-Minus metric when their polls are preceded by \u201cgold standard\u201d polls in the same race. (\u201cGold standard\u201d is the term we use for pollsters that are exclusively live caller with cellphones and are also AAPOR/NCPP/Roper members.) Live-caller polls do not exhibit the same pattern, however; their Advanced Plus-Minus score is unaffected by the existence of an earlier \u201cgold standard\u201d poll in the field. This is probably the result of herding; some of the lower-quality pollsters may be doing the equivalent of peeking at their more studious classmate\u2019s answers in a math test. In fact, these differences are especially strong in recent elections, suggesting that herding has become more of a problem.\n\nThere is also a second, more direct method to detect herding, which we\u2019re also now applying in our pollster ratings. Namely \u2014 as described in this story \u2014 there is a minimum distance that a poll should be from the average of previous polls based on sampling error alone. For instance, even if you knew that a candidate was ahead 48-41 in a particular race \u2014 a 7-point lead \u2014 you\u2019d miss that margin by an average of about 5 percentage points in a 600-person poll because sampling only 600 people rather than the entire population introduces sampling error. That is, because of sampling error, some polls would inevitably show a 12-point lead and some would show a 2-point lead instead of all the polls being bunched together at a 6- or 7- or 8-point lead exactly. If the polls are very tightly bunched together, this is not a good thing \u2014 you should be suspicious of herding, which can sometimes yield embarrassing outcomes where every poll gets the answer wrong\n\nOf course, there are other complications in the real world. There\u2019s no guarantee that the race will have been static since other pollsters surveyed the race; one candidate may be losing or gaining ground. And pollsters have healthy methodological disagreements from one another, so the same race may look different depending on what assumptions they make about turnout and so forth. But these should tend to increase the degree to which polls differ from each other, and not produce herding.\n\nBut our herding penalty only applies if pollsters show too little variation from the average of previous polls of the race based on sampling error alone. If a pollster is publishing all its data without being influenced by other pollsters \u2014 including its supposed outliers \u2014 it should be fairly easy to avoid this penalty over the long run.\n\nMany polls are closer to the average of previous polls than they \u201cshould\u201d be, however. Unlike the previous type of herding I described, which is concentrated among lower-quality pollsters who are essentially trying to draft off their neighbors to get better results, this tendency appears among some higher-quality pollsters as well. In some cases, we suspect, this is because, late in the race, a pollster doesn\u2019t want to deal with the media firestorm that would inevitably ensue if it published a poll that appears to be an outlier. In other cases, frankly, we suspect that pollsters rather explicitly look at the FiveThirtyEight or RealClearPolitics polling average and attempt to match it.\n\nIn any event, our formula now detects this type of herding, and it results in a lower pollster rating when we catch it. . Our pollster ratings spreadsheet now calculates each pollster\u2019s Average Distance from Polling Average, or ADPA, which is how much the pollster\u2019s average poll differs from the average of previous polls of that race. Among pollsters with at least 15 polls, the largest herding penalties are as follows:\n\nWhich pollsters show the clearest signs of herding? Pollster Herding Penalty Research Co. 1.17 Muhlenberg College 0.84 Angus Reid Global 0.82 Grove Insight 0.71 NBC News/Wall Street Journal 0.53 The list is limited to pollsters with at least 15 polls for which an average of previous polls can be computed.\n\nOther methodological changes\n\nUnless you\u2019re really into details \u2014 or you\u2019re a pollster! \u2014 you probably aren\u2019t going to care about these \u2026 but there are a few other methodological changes we\u2019ve made to our pollster ratings this year.\n\nPreviously, pollsters got a bonus if they exclusively conducted their polls via live callers with cellphones, since these have been the most accurate polls over time. But this year, if a pollster uses live-caller-with-cellphone polls in combination with other methodologies, we now give them partial credit for the live-caller bonus. Even though these hybrid polls did not have a particularly good performance in 2017-19, they\u2019ve been reasonably strong in the long run; also, we\u2019re bowing to the reality that many formerly live pollsters are increasingly incorporating online or other methods into their repertoire.\n\nIn determining whether a poll\u2019s result fell into or outside the margin of error, a calculation that\u2019s available in our spreadsheet, we now use a more sophisticated margin of error formula that accounts for the percentages of the top two candidates and not just the distance between them. The margin of error is smaller in lopsided races, e.g., when one candidate leads 70-20.\n\nOur Predictive Plus-Minus scores and pollster letter grades are based on a combination of a pollster\u2019s empirical performance (how accurate it has been in the past) and its methodological characteristics. The more polls a firm has conducted, the more the formula weights its performance rather than its methodological prior. In assigning the weights, our formula now considers how recent a particular firm\u2019s polls were. In other words, if a pollster has conducted a lot of surveys recently, its empirical accuracy will be more heavily weighted. But if most of its polling is in the distant past, its pollster rating will gradually revert toward the mean based on its methodology.\n\nFor pollsters with a relatively small sample of polling, we now show a provisional rating rather than a precise letter grade. (An \u201cA/B\u201d provisional rating means that the pollster has shown strong initial results, a \u201cB/C\u201d rating means it has average initial results, and a \u201cC/D\u201d rating means below-average initial results.) It now takes roughly 20 recent polls (or a larger number of older polls) for a pollster to get a precise pollster rating.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now! Once again, you can find an interactive version of the pollster ratings here, and a link with further detail on them here.

Good luck to pollsters on having a strong performance in the primaries.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-state-of-the-polls-2019/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "The State Of The Polls, 2016", "text": "Two years ago, in advance of the 2014 midterms and in conjunction with the release of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings, I wrote an article headlined \u201cIs The Polling Industry In Stasis Or In Crisis?\u201d It pointed out a seeming contradiction: Although there were lots of reasons to be worried about the reliability of polling \u2014 in particular, the ever-declining response rates for telephone surveys \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much evidence of a crisis in the results pollsters were obtaining. Instead, the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles had all featured fairly accurate polling.\n\nHas the reckoning come for the polls since then? The evidence is somewhat mixed. The 2014 midterm elections were not a banner year for pollsters, with most polls showing a statistical bias toward Democrats (reversing their statistical bias toward Republicans in 2012). As a result, there were a handful of major upsets by Republican candidates, along with a few near misses. Still, the error in the polls was reasonably in line with historical norms. It wasn\u2019t the disaster that pollsters have experienced in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Greece, or even in previous U.S. midterm elections, such as 1994 and 1998.\n\nPollster Ratings: We\u2019ve analyzed the historical accuracy of more than 350 polling agencies and rated them according to performance and methodology. See all of our pollster ratings \u00bb\n\nIf the 2014 midterm polls were a little better than reputed, however, the reverse might be true of the 2016 presidential primaries polls. Importantly, the polls (and even more so, the polling averages) had a good track record of calling winners, with the polling front-runner winning the vast majority of the time. Furthermore, the polls caught wind of Donald Trump\u2019s popularity among Republicans early in the cycle, even as a lot of journalists (including, uhh, yours truly) were deeply skeptical about his chances. But the margins were often pretty far off, especially in the Democratic race, with Hillary Clinton often blowing away her polling numbers in the South and Bernie Sanders often doing so elsewhere in the country. Furthermore, although there weren\u2019t many upsets, at least one of them \u2014 Sanders\u2019s win in Michigan \u2014 was historically epic.\n\nDon\u2019t take our word for it, though: We\u2019d encourage you to explore the data for yourself. We\u2019ve just released a new set of pollster ratings, based on data up through and including the Oregon presidential primary May 17. We\u2019ve also published the raw data behind these ratings: more than 7,900 polls conducted in the final three weeks before presidential primaries and caucuses and general elections for president, governor, and the U.S. Senate and House since 1998.\n\nThe methodology we use to calculate the pollster ratings is highly similar to the procedures we followed to generate our 2014 ratings, with a handful of exceptions that I describe in the footnotes.\n\nAs before, the ratings are based both on a pollster\u2019s past accuracy and on two easily measurable methodological standards:\n\nThe first standard is whether the firm participates in the American Association for Public Opinion Research Transparency Initiative, is a member of the National Council on Public Polls or contributes its data to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archive. Polling firms that do one or more of these things generally abide by industry-standard practices for disclosure, transparency and methodology and have historically had more accurate results.\n\nThe second standard is whether the firm usually conducts its polls by placing telephone calls with live interviewers and calls cellphones as well as landlines. Automated polls (\u201crobopolls\u201d), which are legally prohibited from calling cellphones, do not meet this standard even if they use hybrid or mixed-mode methodologies (for example, robocalling landlines and then supplementing with cellphone calls placed by live interviewers). It\u2019s increasingly essential to call cellphones given that about half of American households no longer have a home landline. Although internet polls show promise as a potential alternative, they do not yet have a long enough or consistent enough track record to be placed on the same pedestal as high-quality, live-interview telephone polls, based on our view of the evidence.\n\nBut enough about methodology; let\u2019s return to the question of how the polls fared in the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential primaries.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a calculation we call Simple Average Error. It measures the difference between the percentage of the vote separating the top two finishers in the election and the margin shown by the polls. For instance, if a poll had projected Trump to beat Ted Cruz by 2 percentage points in an election and Trump won by 10 points, that would count as an 8 percentage point error. Likewise, it would count as an 8-point error if Trump had been projected to beat Cruz by 2 points but lost to him by 6 instead.\n\nIn 2014, the average gubernatorial poll had an error of 4.5 percentage points as defined in this way, and the average Senate poll had an error of 5.4 percentage points. The gubernatorial polls were a bit more accurate than usual and the Senate polls a bit less, but both figures are reasonably in line with historical norms. A bigger problem is that most of these polls missed in the same direction, underestimating the Republican candidate. (We\u2019ll take that point up in a moment.)\n\nHouse polls are typically less accurate than Senate or gubernatorial polls \u2014 the further down the ballot you go, the larger the polling error tends to be \u2014 and 2014 was no exception, with the average House poll missing by 7.9 percentage points. That\u2019s not a good result by any stretch of the imagination, although that number is inflated somewhat by a single polling firm, YouGov, which ambitiously released polls of all 435 congressional districts. Most of those polls had small sample sizes of fewer than 200 respondents, and most of them were in noncompetitive districts, which can be difficult to poll. (Our Advanced Plus-Minus and Predictive Plus-Minus calculations adjust for these factors, but Simple Average Error does not.) Excluding YouGov, the average error for House polls was 6.6 percentage points, still a mediocre performance, although similar to past years such as 1998 and 2010.\n\nIf House races can be tricky to poll, presidential primaries are even harder, for some of the reasons I mention here. Turnout is relatively low, people are sometimes choosing among several similar candidates, and voters often wait until the last minute to make their decisions. So primary polling is almost always a fairly wild ride. Still, the average error in primary polls this year was a whopping 9.4 percentage points, worse than the average of 8.1 percentage points in all presidential primaries since 2000. The problems were worse on the Democratic side, with an average error of 10.6 percentage points, compared with 8.3 percentage points in the Republican race.\n\nAnd yet, the primary polls have done a pretty good job of picking winners. In 85 percent of polls this year, the leading candidate in the poll matched the winning candidate in the election. That\u2019s much better than in 2012, when the leading candidate won in the polls only 61 percent of the time.\n\nWhat gives? A lot of primaries and caucuses were lopsided this year, with strongly regional voting patterns; Clinton dominated in the South, and Trump cleaned up in the Northeast, for example. (By contrast, a lot of Republican primaries came down to the wire in 2012.) It\u2019s easier to call the winners right, of course, when an election isn\u2019t competitive. On the other hand, it can be harder for pollsters to nail down the margin in such races. A seemingly noncompetitive race can discourage turnout, either allowing the leading candidate to run up the score or, occasionally, the trailing candidate to do much better than expected because the leading candidate\u2019s voters become complacent. As a technical matter, the handling of undecided voters also matters more in noncompetitive races. In a slight change this year, our Advanced Plus-Minus and Predictive Plus-Minus ratings account for the fact that less-competitive races are associated with a larger error, on average. Still, this doesn\u2019t entirely excuse the polls.\n\nAnother useful measure of polling performance is statistical bias, which indicates whether polls consistently miss in the same direction. If over a large number of races, for example, your polling firm projects Democratic candidates to win by an average of 5 percentage points, and they win by 2 percentage points instead, that means those polls had a pro-Democratic (and anti-Republican) statistical bias of 3 percentage points. Statistical bias isn\u2019t necessarily an indication of partisan bias; some media outlets that are accused of having a pro-Republican bias in their coverage have a pro-Democratic statistical bias in their polls, and vice versa. But it has nevertheless been a problem in recent years:\n\nIn 2012, the polls had a 2 or 3 percentage point pro-Republican bias, meaning that they underrated how well President Obama would do, along with Democratic candidates in gubernatorial and congressional races. In 2014, by contrast, they had roughly a 3 percentage point pro-Democratic bias. So rather than the merely good Republican year implied by the polls, Republicans had a near-landslide in the midterms instead.\n\nThe good news is that, over the long run, the polls haven\u2019t had much of an overall bias, having underrated Republicans in some elections and Democrats in others. But the bias has shifted around somewhat unpredictably from election to election. You should be wary of claims that the polls are bound to be biased in the same direction that they were two years ago or four years ago.\n\nYou should also recognize the potential for statistical bias even (or perhaps especially) if the polls all seem to agree with one another. An uncannily strong consensus among the polls may indicate herding, which means polling firms are suppressing outlier results that appear out of line with the consensus. Good election forecasting models can account for the possibility of herding and statistical bias by assuming that the error in polls is correlated from state to state, but it raises the degree of difficulty in building a model.\n\nWhat about bias in the presidential primary polls? Those numbers aren\u2019t shown in the table above because the bias calculations we list in our pollster ratings pertain only to general elections. But we can calculate them by the same method. Indeed, statistical bias has been a problem in both party primaries this year.\n\nIn Republican primaries and caucuses, the polls generally had a pro-Trump and anti-Cruz bias. In races where Trump and Cruz were the top two finishers in some order, the bias was 5.5 percentage points in Trump\u2019s favor. The bias dissipated as the race went along, and there wasn\u2019t as much of a bias when another candidate \u2014 John Kasich or Marco Rubio \u2014 was Trump\u2019s main competitor in a state. Still, the primary results ought to raise doubts about the theory that a \u201csilent majority\u201d of Trump supporters is being overlooked by the polls. In the primaries, Trump was somewhat overrated by the polls.\n\nIn the Democratic race, the polls had a 1.8 percentage point bias toward Clinton (and against Sanders) overall. However, it varied significantly based on the demographic makeup of the state, with Clinton outperforming her polls in diverse states and Sanders beating his in whiter ones. Specifically, in states where at least 25 percent of the population is black or Hispanic, the polls had a pro-Sanders, anti-Clinton bias of 5.7 percentage points. But they had an 8.2 percentage point bias toward Clinton, and against Sanders, in states where less than 25 percent of the population is black or Hispanic.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the polls mostly identified the right winners, and some of the bias reflected the candidates\u2019 running up the score in demographically favorable terrain. (Clinton, for instance, won South Carolina by 47 percentage points instead of the 27 points projected by the polls.) Still, the results are troubling given that the Sanders and Clinton coalitions each contain hard-to-poll groups. In Clinton\u2019s case, that means black and Hispanic voters, who are usually harder for polls to reach than white voters. For Sanders, that means young and first-time voters, who are also hard to reach and who are sometimes screened out incorrectly by likely voter models. Pollsters should think carefully about their strategies for reaching these groups in the general election.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s take a look at how some of the more prolific pollsters have performed recently. The following table contains our Advanced Plus-Minus scores for polling firms that released at least 20 total polls between the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential primaries. Advanced Plus-Minus measures a poll\u2019s error as compared against others that surveyed the same race, controlling for factors such as the number of days between the poll and the election. Negative scores are good and mean the pollster performed better than other polling firms under similar conditions.\n\nThe best-performing polls recently have been those from Monmouth University and those from Marist College. Both apply \u201cgold standard\u201d methodologies, using live telephone interviews and placing calls to cellphones as well as landlines, and both participate in the AAPOR Transparency Initiative. Quinnipiac University, another \u201cgold standard\u201d pollster, has also performed fairly well of late. So has Fox News, which switched to new polling partners in 2011 and has gotten good results since then.\n\nAutomated polling firms have gotten mediocre results in recent years, especially SurveyUSA and Rasmussen Reports, although note that SurveyUSA has a long history of accurate polling and so retains a high grade overall. Public Policy Polling has gotten fairly good results, by contrast, although that may be because the pollster engages in a high degree of herding.\n\nYouGov, which fared poorly by calculations such as Simple Average Error, gets about an average rating according to Advanced Plus-Minus, which accounts for the fact that they were polling under difficult circumstances (for instance, polling obscure House races that nobody else tried to survey). Still, we\u2019re awaiting more evidence about the reliability of online polls. SurveyMonkey, which has sometimes partnered with FiveThirtyEight, released a set of polls of the Democratic and Republican primaries before Super Tuesday and got mediocre results, but it isn\u2019t really enough data to come to conclusions about long-term accuracy. Other online polling firms, such as Morning Consult and Ipsos, have focused on national polls instead of issuing state polls ahead of key primaries and general elections. In my view, the online pollsters have been too gun-shy as a group (with YouGov an important exception) to issue polls of state and local elections. These firms employ a lot of smart people, and my working assumption is that online polls are already more accurate than automated telephone polls (if not necessarily traditional telephone polls, at least not yet). But that\u2019s nothing more than an educated guess until we get more data on how they perform.\n\nListen to the latest episode of the FiveThirtyEight politics podcast.\n\nParticipation in the AAPOR Transparency Initiative, NCPP or the Roper Center archive continues to be a strong predictor of polling accuracy. Polling firms that get our AAPOR/NCPP/Roper check mark have had an Advanced Plus-Minus score of -0.4 since 2014, compared with a score of +0.8 for those that don\u2019t have it.\n\nAll told, the evidence is ambiguous enough to be consistent with almost any case you\u2019d like to make: either that the polls are about as accurate as they\u2019ve always been, which isn\u2019t to say that they\u2019re perfect, or that there are real warning signs of trouble ahead, which isn\u2019t to say the polls are useless. The answer may also depend on which polls you\u2019re looking at. As we\u2019ve found in the past, polls that employ more expensive methodologies, and abide by higher levels of disclosure and transparency, tend to be more accurate than those that don\u2019t. It may be that the best polls are roughly as accurate as ever but that the worst polls are increasingly far off the mark.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-state-of-the-polls-2016/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "How One High-Risk Community In Rural South Carolina Is Bracing For COVID-19", "text": "How One High-Risk Community In Rural South Carolina Is Bracing For COVID-19 Hardeeville has one of the country\u2019s highest ratios of vulnerable residents to ICU beds.\n\nJust as some demographic groups are more at risk than others of getting seriously ill from the new coronavirus, some parts of the country are more vulnerable to being hit hard by this pandemic. In places with more sick people, more people over 65 and fewer hospital beds per person, the health care system could easily be swamped, leaving residents who need hospitalization in even greater danger.\n\nTo find the areas at the greatest risk of being overwhelmed by a COVID-19 outbreak, we analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a collection of surveys that ask U.S. residents about their health, which allowed us to estimate what percentage of residents in a region were at risk due to their age or underlying health conditions. We then used Kaiser Health News\u2019s data on the number of hospitals and intensive care unit beds in each U.S. county to find the ratio of at-risk residents to beds.\n\nBy that measure, one of the most vulnerable regions for which we have data is the Hilton Head Island metropolitan area, where about 63 percent of adults are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and there are approximately 3,900 high-risk individuals for every ICU bed.\n\nWhile the percentage of Hilton Head residents who are at risk is on the higher end of our data set, it\u2019s still notably lower than the 70 to 80 percent we saw in several other areas we analyzed. But those regions had more health care facilities to serve those at-risk residents, while the Hilton Head area has only three hospitals and 28 ICU beds.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight\n\nTake Hardeeville, for example. It\u2019s a small city in the Hilton Head metropolitan area, and in many ways it\u2019s like any other rural area. Under normal circumstances, the city\u2019s residents would be looking forward to an Easter egg hunt, golf and pickleball tournaments, proms and graduations. But the people of Hardeeville are particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus. In the last decade, the city has seen a population boom, and many of those new residents are retirees, according to Hardeeville Mayor Harry Williams. The city\u2019s large older population \u2014 the percentage of residents who\u2019ve hit retirement age is nearly twice as high as the national share of people over 65 \u2014 may be cause for concern, as Jasper County, where Hardeeville is located, has only one hospital and four ICU beds.\n\nWhile regular hospital beds can be converted to serve critically ill patients, it\u2019s not easy to do because ICU beds require more equipment and specialized room layouts. Despite the difficulties, Coastal Carolina Hospital, the only hospital in Jasper County, has added beds for seriously ill patients by turning its observation unit into an ICU patient treatment area, according to hospital CEO Joel Taylor. Other hospitals are adding beds in temporary spaces like tents and trailers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just a lack of beds that can strain the health care system, noted David Wallace, a critical care doctor and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Shortages of space, staff, medications and other vital resources are also a concern, and health systems in rural and poorer areas will be stretched the thinnest.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be parts of the country that don\u2019t even have the staffing even if you were able to ramp up your available resources, in terms of places to put these patients,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIf we were able to create more ICU beds and more ventilators and more [personal protective equipment], who\u2019s going to be staffing those areas?\u201d\n\nCoastal Carolina Hospital is cataloguing what skills workers already have and cross-training them to work in parts of the hospital outside their normal assignments. This gives the hospital more flexibility in staffing, allowing it to do more with a limited number of employees by switching people to cover areas facing staffing shortfalls.\n\nHardeeville\u2019s mayor is also worried about how easy it would be for the area to run out of other types of vital workers, like first responders. \u201cBeing in a rural area, we have a good staff, but it\u2019s not a staff that can afford to have a whole shift wiped out because one person got sick and passed it onto the entire shift,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big concern of ours because we don\u2019t have replacement numbers if our first responders get sick.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the city got a shipment of additional masks and other protective gear for its first responders a few weeks ago, just as supplies were running low. So far, the city hasn\u2019t run out, but it also doesn\u2019t have a stockpile that would last through a big surge of cases.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there have only been 15 COVID-19 cases and one death in Jasper County, according to South Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Environmental Control. COVID-19 data should always be taken with a grain of salt, though, since tests have been so hard to come by. The closest testing site to Hardeeville is a hospital in a neighboring county, about 35 minutes away. Coastal Carolina is working on being able to test patients on site, Taylor said.\n\nThe state is encouraging residents to practice social distancing. But of course, staying at home is easier for some people than others. Williams said that in the gated communities where older residents often live, \u201cAmazon is a way of life,\u201d but that\u2019s not the case for working families.\n\n\u201cDelivery services are not as effective as, let\u2019s say, New York City,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor the working families that have to go to the grocery stores, go to Walmart for their everyday needs, those people need to go out. Those stores are open and they are taking precautions. The governor has limited the amount of people allowed in them, based on their square footage.\u201d\n\nBut even those who have to go out are doing their best to keep infection rates down, Williams said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s pitching in.\u201d\n\nBut more people may start leaving their homes soon. Shutting down businesses is having devastating effects on the economy, and the Hilton Head area is a popular vacation destination, so losing that influx of tourism dollars is an especially big blow for places like Hardeeville. South Carolina\u2019s governor announced Monday to allow public beaches and some retail stores to reopen. But experts say relaxing social distancing measures too soon and before testing is widely available might result in another influx of cases, overwhelming the health care system and leading to even more deaths.\n\nFind the full data set on GitHub to see if your area is included and how it compares with other areas.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-one-high-risk-community-in-rural-south-carolina-is-bracing-for-covid-19/", "author": ["Likhitha Butchireddygari"]}, {"title": "How Urban Or Rural Is Your State? And What Does That Mean For The 2020 Election?", "text": "How Urban Or Rural Is Your State? And What Does That Mean For The 2020 Election?\n\nThe 2016 election may not have been a realignment by historical standards, but it did bring the country\u2019s political divides more in line with its cultural divides \u2014 the biggest of which may be the growing chasm between urban and rural Americans.\n\nEssentially, it boils down to this: Cities and (especially these days) suburbs vote Democratic, and rural areas vote Republican. Some research suggests that these patterns hold up even after accounting for other important political predictors like race or gender. And there\u2019s evidence that the urban-rural divide has continued to increase since 2016. For example, San Diego has historically voted Republican, but the GOP was shut out of the 2020 mayoral election after two Democrats won the most votes in the city\u2019s March jungle primary. At the same time, Republicans widened their margins in rural areas even amid their defeat in the 2018 midterms, and parts of Appalachia that had voted Democratic for generations now vote Republican up and down the ballot, completing their conversion to the GOP under President Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, however, to measure just how urban or rural a place is (although CityLab\u2019s Congressional Density Index and The New York Times Upshot\u2019s \u201cneighborhood density\u201d are good starts). So FiveThirtyEight came up with one of its own, which has already played a role in our 2020 primary forecast\u2019s \u201cfundamentals\u201d calculations. Essentially, we calculated the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of every census tract and took the natural logarithm to create an \u201curbanization index,\u201d or a calculation of how urban or rural a given area is. And this number can be calculated (via a weighted average based on each census tract\u2019s population) for states, congressional districts, counties \u2014 or anything that is made up of census tracts. Here is a calculation for how urban or rural each of the 50 states is:\n\nHow urban or rural is your state?

Source: American Community Survey\n\nYou may have noticed a pattern in the table above. The states with the highest urbanization indices include a lot of blue states, like New York, New Jersey and California. Meanwhile, the rural end of the spectrum is populated with red states like Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota. Indeed, if we directly compare this metric with the results of the 2016 presidential election, we can quantify just how important the urban-rural divide has become in our politics.\n\nAs you can see in the chart below, 10 of the 13 most urban states voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, while 12 of the 14 most rural states voted for Trump. The exceptions: the fairly urbanized states of Florida, Arizona and Texas, which went for Trump, and the more rural states of Vermont and Maine, which cast their ballots for Clinton.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, too, that this relationship between a state\u2019s \u201curbanness\u201d and its presidential vote will get even stronger in 2020, as the correlation got noticeably tighter from 2012 to 2016 (the correlation coefficient was 0.55 in 2012 and 0.69 in 2016).\n\nSo let\u2019s indulge in a little hypothetical and take this possibility to the extreme. What if the 2020 presidential vote were based purely on our urbanization index? According to our calculations, Democrats would win such a presidential election handily \u2014 323 electoral votes to 215. And the election would produce a pretty funky-looking Electoral College map \u2014 one that looks simultaneously impossible and yet also like the logical conclusion of the way our politics has been trending. Here\u2019s what the margin of victory would look like in each state:\n\nWhat if the urban-rural divide dictated the 2020 election? The results of a hypothetical presidential election if a state\u2019s urbanization were the only factor, based on the relationship between FiveThirtyEight\u2019s urbanization index and 2016 presidential election results State Result State Result Alabama R+16.0 Montana R+30.8 Alaska R+27.3 Nebraska R+8.2 Arizona D+6.1 Nevada D+12.3 Arkansas R+20.5 New Hampshire R+11.9 California D+17.7 New Jersey D+18.3 Colorado D+4.2 New Mexico R+12.2 Connecticut D+7.6 New York D+22.5 Delaware D+2.3 North Carolina R+6.6 Florida D+8.3 North Dakota R+23.2 Georgia R+3.6 Ohio D+0.6 Hawaii D+3.3 Oklahoma R+11.6 Idaho R+16.1 Oregon R+1.5 Illinois D+10.3 Pennsylvania D+4.1 Indiana R+5.5 Rhode Island D+11.6 Iowa R+16.1 South Carolina R+9.4 Kansas R+9.3 South Dakota R+27.4 Kentucky R+13.6 Tennessee R+8.3 Louisiana R+8.6 Texas D+4.5 Maine R+23.4 Utah D+1.7 Maryland D+11.5 Vermont R+25.9 Massachusetts D+13.2 Virginia D+1.0 Michigan R+0.3 Washington D+3.8 Minnesota R+4.9 West Virginia R+22.4 Mississippi R+25.1 Wisconsin R+8.3 Missouri R+8.2 Wyoming R+33.6 Source: American Community Survey\n\nYes, some of the results are fantasies. Utah, despite being a bit more urban than your average state, is not going to vote Democratic any time soon. And if Vermont votes Republican by nearly 26 points, please pinch me.\n\nBut other results look more plausible, even if they are maybe a few election cycles away from this reality. In this scenario, the Midwest continues its embrace of the GOP, enough to make Minnesota a red state and Wisconsin go Republican by more than 8 points. Thanks to Chicago, Illinois would be the only Democratic bastion left in the region; Michigan and Ohio, though, would remain swing states.\n\nDemocrats, however, would more than make up for losses in the Midwest with wins in the Sun Belt. Florida, Arizona and Texas would become light blue states in this hypothetical. And given that these three states were decided by single digits in 2016, it\u2019s actually not that far-fetched that they could vote Democratic in 2020 in real life. That said, two other emerging Democratic targets, Georgia and North Carolina, remain red states in a world where elections break down exactly along urban-rural lines.\n\nBear in mind that this exercise was, as they say, for entertainment purposes only. The urban-rural divide will never explain everything about our politics; indeed, analysis that places too much weight on it misses the fact that many African Americans in rural areas vote Democratic, or that many Cuban Americans in urban areas like Miami vote Republican. But it does help to illustrate why so many Democrats believe the path forward for their party is through the Sun Belt.\n\nAnd indeed, early polls suggest former Vice President Joe Biden is competitive with Trump in Florida, Arizona and, to a lesser extent, Texas. In a simple average of eight Florida polls conducted since Jan. 1, Biden leads Trump 48 percent to 46 percent. And in a simple average of eight Arizona polls so far this year, Biden leads Trump 47 percent to 45 percent. But Biden still trails Trump, 48 percent to 44 percent, in a simple average of this year\u2019s Texas polls. Still, that would be remarkably close for a state that Mitt Romney carried by nearly 16 points in 2012.\n\nObviously, these numbers can change; general-election polls have yet to come into their full predictive value. But if Biden does carry one or more of these states, he could have their high rate of urbanization to thank.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Our 2020 Election Priors", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107 And The Mavs Are Pushing The Limits Of Offensive Efficiency", "text": "A few weeks ago, Chris Herring wrote about just how historically dominant the 2019-20 Milwaukee Bucks have been on defense, a fact that has gone somewhat unnoticed as Giannis Antetokounmpo and his sharpshooting friends have cruised through the league this year. But the Bucks aren\u2019t the only team having a season for the ages on one side of the ball.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks are an absolute offensive powerhouse this year. Dallas currently leads the NBA in offensive efficiency with 116.8 points per 100 possessions; that\u2019s 6.4 points of efficiency better than the league average this season, which is the 30th-best margin over average in NBA history.

Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nAny way you measure it, this Mavs attack is scoring at one of the most efficient rates ever. And a lot of the credit has rightly gone to second-year guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107, who is on the short list of this year\u2019s MVP candidates after winning Rookie of the Year honors last season. Among players with at least 895 minutes played this season, Don\u010di\u0107 ranks third on offense (behind only James Harden and Damian Lillard) in our RAPTOR metric with a rating of +7.7 \u2014 meaning we estimate that his offense has been worth a shade under 8 more points than an average player for every 100 possessions his team plays.\n\nIs that a lot? Why yes, it is. Historically speaking, there have been only 31 individual seasons (including those from Harden and Lillard) since the 1976 ABA merger in which a player logged at least 1,500 minutes and had an offensive RAPTOR better than Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s has been this year. And Don\u010di\u0107 is easily the youngest player in the sample to produce this kind of offensive season, in his age-20 season (as of Feb. 1). Nobody on the list above him did it at age 21; Chris Paul was the youngest, at age 22 back in 2007-08.\n\nAlthough Don\u010di\u0107 still has room to improve as a long-range shooter \u2014 his 3-point accuracy of 31.5 percent ranks 140th out of 147 qualified players this season \u2014 the rest of his offensive statistics have been stellar. Don\u010di\u0107 excels at creating chances for others; he\u2019s assisted on 45.6 percent of teammate baskets while in the game. He\u2019s also great at creating for himself: He has a true shooting percentage of 58.3 percent with a usage rate of 37.0 percent, numbers that are particularly impressive when you realize that only 18.2 percent of his buckets have been assisted by a teammate (the fourth-lowest rate in the league). With his tremendous ability to get to the rim, absorb contact and finish the play, Don\u010di\u0107 is generating 115.9 points per 100 possessions while also personally finishing 38.4 percent of the Mavs\u2019 possessions that he\u2019s on the court for \u2014 numbers that are in rarified territory on the usage-vs.-efficiency skill curve.\n\nSo with Don\u010di\u0107 playing 54.9 percent of Dallas\u2019s available minutes at a +7.7 RAPTOR offensive clip, we would expect a totally average team that added him to instantly outscore a typical offense by 3.4 points per 100 possessions. But as we mentioned before, the Mavericks as a team have actually been 6.4 points per 100 better than average \u2014 meaning Dallas\u2019s standout offensive season has been about more than just Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s individual excellence.\n\nAccording to Basketball-Reference.com, seven members of the 2019-20 Mavericks have played at least one-third of the team\u2019s available minutes and generated at least 115 points per 100 possessions: Don\u010di\u0107 (115.9), Dorian Finney-Smith (121.6), Tim Hardaway Jr. (116.4), Maxi Kleber (123.4), Seth Curry (124.4), Delon Wright (121.2) and Dwight Powell (133.8). (Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is is notably absent from the list; his individual offensive rating of 109.6 is the lowest of Dallas\u2019s regulars, though he is second on the team in usage rate among those playing at least a third of available minutes.) Going back to 1976, no team in modern history has ever finished a season with this many players logging such regular minutes at such high levels of efficiency.\n\nThe Mavs are overflowing with efficient players NBA teams with the most players who played at least one-third of available team minutes and had an individual offensive efficiency of at least 115 points per 100 possessions, 1976-2020 Team Year No. of Players List DAL 2020 7 Fin.-Smith, Hardaway, Don\u010di\u0107, Kleber, Curry, Wright, Powell DEN 2019 6 Joki\u0107, Morris, Millsap, Beasley, Plumlee, Hernang\u00f3mez PHO 1995 6 Majerle, Green, Barkley, Person, Ainge, Johnson CHI 1996 5 Jordan, Pippen, Kukoc, Kerr, Harper CHI 1997 5 Jordan, Pippen, Kerr, Harper, Kukoc HOU 2017 5 Harden, Anderson, Beverley, Capela, Dekker HOU 2020 5 Harden, Tucker, House, McLemore, Capela LAC 2020 5 Harrell, Leonard, Shamet, Beverley, Zubac LAL 1987 5 Johnson, Worthy, Scott, Cooper, Green LAL 1989 5 Worthy, Johnson, Green, Thompson, Cooper LAL 2020 5 James, Davis, Caldwell-Pope, Howard, McGee MIA 2020 5 Adebayo, Robinson, Butler, Jones, Olynyk OKC 2013 5 Durant, Ibaka, Sefolosha, Martin, Collison OKC 2016 5 Westbrook, Durant, Adams, Kanter, Roberson ORL 1995 5 O\u2019Neal, Hardaway, Grant, Anderson, Scott PHO 1993 5 Majerle, Barkley, Ainge, Johnson, Ceballos PHO 2009 5 Nash, O\u2019Neal, Stoudemire, Richardson, Barbosa PHO 2010 5 Stoudemire, Nash, Richardson, Frye, Dudley POR 2009 5 Roy, Blake, Fernandez, Przybilla, Batum TOR 2018 5 Lowry, Valanciunas, Poeltl, VanVleet, Wright UTA 1998 5 Malone, Hornacek, Russell, Keefe, Stockton Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nTo be sure, Don\u010di\u0107 has opened up many opportunities for his teammates to be efficient. According to Second Spectrum, there\u2019s been a potential assist on 57.3 percent of Dallas\u2019s non-Don\u010di\u0107 shots; for context, the Phoenix Suns are the team with the NBA\u2019s highest rate of potential assists per shot this season, at 57.0 percent. But his teammates still needed to convert on those chances, and they\u2019ve been doing an excellent job of it. Dallas has both seven regulars with a 3-point percentage over 35 percent and seven regulars with a 2-point field-goal percentage over 50 percent. Basically, the Mavericks almost never feature an inefficient offensive option on the floor at any given moment during a game.\n\nOf course, the abundance of 2019-20 teams on the list above shows just how much this efficiency-maximizing mentality has swept across the league, beyond just Luka and the Mavs. In the modern NBA, great offensive teams work like sophisticated machines, where all of the component pieces amplify each other\u2019s strengths. There\u2019s no place for a broken part in that apparatus, so coaches either have to find ways to help a player succeed or slot in a new player who won\u2019t be a liability. It\u2019s a testament to both Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s playmaking and the coaching of Rick Carlisle that Dallas has emerged with so many players performing so well in their roles.\n\nPerhaps an interesting comparison can be found in Dallas\u2019s previous generation of offensive juggernauts. The 2003-04 Mavs remain the greatest offensive team \u2014 relative to league average \u2014 in NBA history (see above), and they did it with four regulars who had an offensive rating over 115 points per 100: Dirk Nowitzki, Michael Finley, Steve Nash and Antawn Jamison. Nash and Nowitzki are particularly known as two of the greatest offensive forces to ever hit the hardwood, capable in their primes of lifting any offense to the top of the league, so it makes sense that they would combine to drive a historic offense. But that team also had a highly inefficient player right in the middle of it: Antoine Walker, who played nearly 72 percent of team minutes and used over 22 percent of possessions while on the court but generated just 100.7 points per 100 possessions.\n\nThough those Mavs were able to integrate him into their scheme and still score at an incredible rate, it\u2019s telling that there are hardly any Walkers to be found in today\u2019s best offenses. Instead, they are built more like the current Mavericks \u2014 a bunch of players who score at a hyper-efficient rate, all orbiting around one central Don\u010di\u0107-like figure who can do everything.\n\nCheck out our latest NBA predictions.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/luka-doncic-and-the-mavs-are-pushing-the-limits-of-offensive-efficiency/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "The Democratic Presidential Candidates Are Becoming Less Popular", "text": "Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nPoll(s) of the week\n\nBeing well-liked matters for presidential candidates: Generally speaking, they need to be at least somewhat popular to win.\n\nTo that effect, Monmouth University and Quinnipiac University each released a poll this week that asked voters whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of leading Democratic presidential candidates and President Trump, but what each pollster found was pretty different.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll found that Trump received the worst marks overall \u2014 a net favorability rating (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) of -17. This figure is 10 percentage points below the lowest-rated Democratic contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and 14 points worse than former Vice President Joe Biden, whose net favorability rating was -3. The Monmouth poll, on the other hand, put Trump\u2019s net favorability at -6, which made him more popular than any of the Democratic front-runners, with the exception of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg was actually the most well-liked candidate in both polls, but his standing is more in flux considering far fewer respondents knew enough about him to have an opinion, compared with those who said the same about Trump, Biden, Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Democratic primary, according to the early states\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? We know that many of 2020 front-runners aren\u2019t as popular as previous presidential contenders (at least at this point in the cycle), but among the general electorate, is Trump really as popular as many of the leading Democratic presidential contenders? To answer this question, we looked at all the national polls we could find since January (over 150 of them) that asked about how well-liked Trump and these candidates are. And as you can see in the chart below, despite one or two recent good polls for Trump, Trump remains really unpopular \u2014 far more than any of the leading Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nBut Democrats\u2019 net favorability ratings have taken a hit. As you can see in the chart above, even though Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg are nowhere near as unpopular as Trump, their net favorability ratings have trended downward recently. This isn\u2019t totally surprising, though, as my colleague Geoffrey Skelley noted a few weeks ago: Many presidential candidates\u2019 net favorability ratings have been negative or close to zero since at least 2008, a sign, perhaps, of the polarized times we live in.\n\nOf course, there is still time for public perception to change (in either direction) between now and November. But if the polls are any indication, opinions of the Democratic candidates seem much more likely to shift than opinions of Trump. That might be because people\u2019s opinions of the Democratic candidates aren\u2019t nearly as entrenched. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, told me that if you look at the breakdown of \u201csomewhat\u201d and \u201cvery\u201d favorable opinions for Trump and the Democratic candidates, \u201copinion about Trump is significantly more deeply held than opinion about any of the Democratic candidates right now.\u201d The same is true if you look at the breakdown of \u201csomewhat\u201d and \u201cvery\u201d unfavorable opinions for Trump and the Democratic candidates \u2014 Trump is much more actively disliked.\n\nOpinions are pretty set on Trump, but more flexible on Dems Share of respondents who said they had a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable or unfavorable opinion of President Trump and the four Democratic front-runners, according to an average of polls from Oct. 11 to Dec 11, 2019 Favorable Unfavorable Candidate Very Somewhat Difference Very Somewhat Difference Donald Trump 30.3 11.5 +18.8 47.8 9.5 +38.2 Joe Biden 19.4 24.9 -5.4 31.8 15.4 16.4 Bernie Sanders 20.7 23.1 -2.4 34.6 13.4 21.3 Elizabeth Warren 21.1 20.7 0.4 34.4 10.5 23.9 Pete Buttigieg 14.1 20.3 -6.2 23.3 12.4 10.9 Source: Polls\n\nSo though Trump may be less popular than his prospective Democratic opponents overall, he has a pretty high level of enthusiastic support \u2014 32 percent of respondents said they had a \u201cvery\u201d favorable opinion of him in an average of the last two months of polls. No Democratic contender has earned marks as high.\n\nThis isn\u2019t all that surprising considering Democrats still haven\u2019t settled on their nominee. Once they pick someone to take on Trump, this could all change, too, and the eventual Democratic nominee could end up even more unpopular than Trump \u2014 or maybe with an even more loyal fan base. We can\u2019t know at this point, but it does seem as if there is more opportunity for Democratic candidates to move public opinion \u2014 in either direction \u2014 than there is for Trump.\n\nOther polling bites\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of favorability ratings, the Monmouth and Quinnipiac polls mentioned above also had net favorability ratings for former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the most recent Democratic contender to enter the 2020 race. Unfortunately for Bloomberg, the results weren\u2019t very good. The Monmouth poll put his net approval among registered voters at -28 and the Quinnipiac poll at -19, making these the lowest marks that any one candidate received in both polls, including Trump. Ouch!\n\nHouse Democrats and the Trump administration reached a deal on Tuesday to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that updates the current North American Free Trade Agreement. According to a YouGov/Economist poll, 43 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the deal, 17 percent have an unfavorable view and 40 percent are not sure. The Senate is expected to vote on the deal in 2020.\n\n56 percent of Mexicans say the U.S. poses the greatest threat to their country in the future, while 27 percent cite the U.S. as Mexico\u2019s most dependable ally (around 5 percent said both concurrently), according to a poll by the Pew Research Center.\n\nThree in four Americans plan to have a Christmas tree in their home this year, according to a poll conducted by YouGov, but only 15 percent say they will buy a real tree. Thirty-eight percent plan to use an artificial tree they already own, while 11 percent plan to buy an artificial tree.\n\nMorning Consult collected surveys of nearly 375,000 adults and found that Fox News is the most-watched cable news outlet in the U.S. in more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s congressional districts (respondents were asked whether they watched CNN, Fox News or MSNBC). On average, 33 percent of adults say they watch the network at least once a week, followed by 28 percent who say they watch CNN and 20 percent who watch MSNBC.\n\nFairVote partnered with YouGov to release a poll of the South Carolina Democratic primary that simulates the primary under a ranked-choice voting system. The way it works is that voters rank the candidates by preference (with the ability to rank up to 10 of the 18 candidates or just the five candidates with the highest polling averages). The candidate with the fewest votes is then eliminated and his or her votes redistributed to each voters\u2019 next choice. This process is repeated until one candidate (the winner) is left.

According to Politico\u2019s polling tracker, Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 leads the field with about 29 percent of the vote, but needs a majority (51 percent) to win. If that doesn\u2019t happen, the election will go to a runoff in January.\n\nTrump approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 41.9 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -11.3 points). At this time last week, 41.8 percent approved and 53.3 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -11.5 points).

Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard was mentioned in almost twice as many cable news clips this week compared to last. Much of the cable news attention came when former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton suggested that Gabbard was being groomed by the Russians for a third-party run to undermine Democrats\u2019 chances in 2020. In fact, the most common words mentioned in 15-second clips mentioning Gabbard were \u201cHillary,\u201d \u201cClinton,\u201d \u201cRussian\u201d and \u201casset.\u201d\n\nBut Gabbard didn\u2019t get the same amount of attention across networks last week. She was mentioned in 66 clips on CNN and 71 clips on MSNBC, but 339 clips (almost five times as many) on Fox News.\n\nCheck out the data behind this series and check back each week for an update on which candidates are getting the most coverage on cable news.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-media-frenzy-around-biden-is-fading/", "author": ["Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "Introducing RAPTOR, Our New Metric For The Modern NBA", "text": "Introducing RAPTOR, Our New Metric For The Modern NBA Our scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should.\n\nAt FiveThirtyEight, we\u2019ve been running NBA predictions since 2015. We started with Elo ratings before introducing our CARMELO player projection system, which we then incorporated into our \u201cCARM-Elo\u201d season prediction model. We tested and tweaked the prediction model over the years, but it was always powered by metrics from other sources, such as Box Plus/Minus (BPM) and Real Plus-Minus (RPM).\n\nBut that changes this year. RAPTOR, which stands for Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings, is FiveThirtyEight\u2019s new NBA statistic. We\u2019re pretty excited about it. In addition to being a statistic that we bake in house, RAPTOR fulfills two long-standing goals of ours:\n\nFirst, we wanted to create a publicly available statistic that takes advantage of modern NBA data, specifically player tracking and play-by-play data that isn\u2019t available in traditional box scores.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, we wanted a statistic that better reflects how modern NBA teams actually evaluate players.\n\nNBA teams highly value floor spacing, defense and shot creation, and they place relatively little value on traditional big-man skills. RAPTOR likewise values these things \u2014 not because we made any deliberate attempt to design the system that way but because the importance of those skills emerges naturally from the data. RAPTOR thinks ball-dominant players such as James Harden and Steph Curry are phenomenally good. It highly values two-way wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It can have a love-hate relationship with centers, who are sometimes overvalued in other statistical systems. But it appreciates modern centers such as Nikola Joki\u0107 and Joel Embiid, as well as defensive stalwarts like Rudy Gobert.\n\nOur sports podcast, Hot Takedown, discusses RAPTOR\n\nThis article will go over some of the highlights of how RAPTOR works. For a much deeper and more technical description, you can find our methodological explainer here. But these are the highlights:\n\nLike BPM and RPM, RAPTOR is a plus-minus statistic that measures the number of points a player contributes to his team\u2019s offense and defense per 100 possessions, relative to a league-average player. For instance, a player with an offensive RAPTOR rating of +2.1 boosts his team\u2019s performance by 2.1 points per 100 offensive possessions while he is on the floor. Likewise, a player with a defensive RAPTOR of +3.4 would improve his team\u2019s defensive performance by 3.4 points per 100 possessions while he\u2019s on the court.\n\nPlus-minus statistics have certain inherent limitations, and RAPTOR is subject to those, too. Namely, these statistics assume that player performance is largely linear and additive, that is, that you can roughly add up the ratings from individual players to project team performance. In other words, RAPTOR does not account for coaching, systems or synergies between teammates.\n\nRAPTOR consists of two major components that are blended together to rate players: a \u201cbox\u201d (as in \u201cbox score\u201d) component, which uses individual statistics (including statistics derived from player tracking and play-by-play data), and an \u201con-off\u201d component, which evaluates a team\u2019s performance when the player and various combinations of his teammates are on or off the floor.\n\nThe variables included in \u201cbox\u201d RAPTOR were chosen by evaluating how they did in predicting long-term RAPM (real adjusted plus-minus), which is a measure of how a team\u2019s performance changes when the player is on and off the floor. Essentially, this is the same technique that BPM used, only RAPTOR uses play-by-play and player tracking statistics in addition to traditional ones. On offense, for instance, in addition to using traditional statistics like points, RAPTOR accounts for factors such as how many of a player\u2019s field goals were assisted and how valuable these assists were, the value of different types of offensive rebounds, time of possession and various measures of floor spacing, such as the number of contested 3-pointers that the player took. On defense, it looks at factors like how often the player was the nearest defender on an opponents\u2019 shot and how often those shots went in, how many points and rebounds were scored by opponents at the defender\u2019s position, and how often the player induced offensive fouls.\n\nThe \u201con-off\u201d element of RAPTOR evaluates how a player\u2019s team performed while he was on the floor, how the player\u2019s courtmates (the teammates that the player most often shared the court with) performed while they were on the floor without the player, and, finally, how those courtmates\u2019 other courtmates performed when they were on the floor without the player\u2019s courtmates, all adjusted for the strength of competition they were facing. We know it might sound a little goofy. But it\u2019s relatively simple to calculate. And it correlates very well with RAPM, while stabilizing a lot faster than RAPM, which can take years\u2019 worth of data to estimate reliably.\n\nthe player, and, finally, how those courtmates\u2019 other courtmates performed when they were on the floor without the player\u2019s courtmates, all adjusted for the strength of competition they were facing. We know it might sound a little goofy. But it\u2019s relatively simple to calculate. And it correlates very well with RAPM, while stabilizing a lot faster than RAPM, which can take years\u2019 worth of data to estimate reliably. Overall, however, RAPTOR weights the \u201cbox\u201d component more highly than the \u201con-off\u201d component. In testing RAPTOR on out-of-sample data, we found that while on-court/off-court stats provide useful information, they\u2019re nonetheless quite noisy as compared with individual measures of player value that are used in the \u201cbox\u201d part of RAPTOR.\n\nWhen applied to past data \u2014 for instance, in evaluating who the best players were in the 2018-19 season \u2014 RAPTOR is a descriptive statistic. Descriptive RAPTOR is based solely on a player\u2019s on-court performance and the performance of the player\u2019s teammates, as described above. It does not use priors based on a player\u2019s height, weight, age or any other factor.\n\nstatistic.

It does not use priors based on a player\u2019s height, weight, age or any other factor. However, RAPTOR can also be used to make team and player predictions, and indeed our NBA predictions are now fueled by RAPTOR. (We are retiring the CARMELO brand name from our previous projection system, although much of the code for RAPTOR projections is borrowed from CARMELO.) RAPTOR-driven predictions do use qualities such as height, age and draft position, and even whether a player recently appeared on an All-NBA team \u2014 that data improves the performance of the predictive measure. Predictions also weight variables slightly differently than descriptive RAPTOR does, as certain statistics are more subject to luck than others. We refer to this predictive version of RAPTOR as PREDATOR (PREDictive rApTOR).\n\nRAPTOR is based exclusively on publicly available data. There are other player-tracking statistics we believe could be highly helpful to RAPTOR, especially more detailed measures of on-ball defense, so we hope to be able to revisit RAPTOR as additional data becomes available.\n\nRAPTOR\u2019s name (in addition to being a whimsical backronym in the tradition of CARMELO and DRAYMOND) honors the 2018-19 Toronto Raptors, which FiveThirtyEight\u2019s previous projection system correctly predicted had an edge over the Golden State Warriors (even though we didn\u2019t fully believe the projection ourselves at the time).\n\nThe full-fledged version of RAPTOR is available for the 2013-14 season onward, as that\u2019s when the NBA\u2019s player-tracking data came on line. We also have a historical version of RAPTOR called Approximate RAPTOR dating back to 1976-1977, the first season after the ABA-NBA merger, but that uses a far more limited range of data.\n\nRAPTOR ratings for players with at least 1,000 minutes played in a season since 2013-14 can be found in the table below. As you can see, RAPTOR generally loves perimeter players and wings, such as Curry, Harden, Leonard and Chris Paul, although some frontcourt players like Jokic, Anthony Davis and Draymond Green are also rated highly by the system. For more detail on past RAPTORs, including the breakdown of box and on-off components, you can download files that list the regular season and playoffs separately, or a version that combines a

The ball hit a 2-year-old girl, who was rushed out of the stadium. The game stopped as an emotional Almora dropped to a knee. Less than two weeks later, as the Washington Nationals played the White Sox in Chicago, a woman sitting just past the third-base dugout was struck in the face. Less than two weeks after that, a Dodger Stadium spectator sitting just past the netting on the first-base line was hit in the head by a hard line drive off the bat of right fielder Cody Bellinger.\n\nBloomberg News estimated in 2014 that 1,750 fans per year are hurt by batted balls at MLB games. Amid debates over how much protection teams should offer spectators, we wanted to find out which areas of stadiums might be the most dangerous, which could help us figure out what could be done to prevent more fan injuries.\n\nBecause there\u2019s no central database of all of MLB\u2019s foul balls, we had to compile a data set ourselves. To do that, we searched the batted-ball data for this season on Baseball Savant to find the 10 stadiums that produced the most foul balls up to June 5 and then analyzed the pitch-level data from the most foul-heavy game day at each of those stadiums (including one doubleheader). Because we had to individually research each foul ball, we couldn\u2019t look at a whole season\u2019s worth of fouls. By limiting the data set to the most foul-heavy days of play in those 10 stadiums, we aimed to keep the data set to a manageable size while also capturing the largest number of fouls we could from a variety of parks, since stadiums vary dramatically in architecture, altitude and seating arrangements.\n\nDozens of fouls per game in the most foul-heavy parks The most foul-heavy day at each of the 10 stadiums that produced the most fouls this season, as of June 5 Most foul-heavy day Stadium Average No. of Fouls per game Date Matchup No. of Fouls Camden Yards* 57 4/20/19 Baltimore Orioles vs. Minnesota Twins 113 PNC Park 57 6/1/19 Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Milwaukee Brewers 111 Oakland Coliseum 53 6/2/19 Oakland A\u2019s vs. Houston Astros 109 T-Mobile Park 53 5/18/19 Seattle Mariners vs. Minnesota Twins 100 Globe Life Park 55 5/3/19 Texas Rangers vs. Toronto Blue Jays 87 Dodger Stadium 51 3/29/19 Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Arizona Diamondsbacks 86 Miller Park 55 5/4/19 Milwaukee Brewers vs. New York Mets 85 Citizens Bank Park 53 4/27/19 Philadelphia Phillies vs. Miami Marlins 75 SunTrust Park 53 4/14/19 Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets 73 Yankee Stadium 51 3/31/19 New York Yankees vs. Baltimore Orioles 67 * Includes both games of the doubleheader Source: Baseball Savant\n\nWe watched clips of 906 foul balls hit during those games (excluding foul tips, which were never in danger of reaching the stands, and fouls that resulted in outs, because Baseball Savant groups those with other types of caught-ball outs, so we couldn\u2019t get data on foul outs specifically), and we recorded whether the fouls were grounders, fly balls, line drives or pop-ups. Then we split the parks into \u201czones\u201d to categorize the general area where each of those balls landed.\n\nZones 1, 2 and 3 include seats that are largely protected by netting \u2014 the area behind home plate and both dugouts \u2014 along with the corresponding areas of foul territory on the field. Zones 4 and 5 are mostly non-netted seating areas and the foul territory outside the baselines, from the dugout to the foul pole. Zones 6 and 7 cover the areas past the foul poles; the fly balls that land here typically have too much arc to be dangerous, and line drives rarely make it that far.\n\nLess than half of the foul balls we charted were followed by a camera to where they landed. But by gauging angles, we estimated where all of the fouls \u2014 both those that were followed by a camera and those that weren\u2019t \u2014 likely landed. We tested our predictions against the footage of the balls that were followed to check our accuracy.\n\nNearly equal shares of foul balls ended up in zones with netting vs. zones that largely lack netting: 454 balls landed in zones 1, 2 and 3, while 452 balls fell in zones 4 through 7.\n\nThe scariest foul balls are those with high exit velocities, particularly the line drives, which give spectators only seconds \u2014 or fractions of a second \u2014 to react. Statcast was able to measure exit velocities for 580 of the 906 foul balls in our data set, and most of the hardest-hit of those 580 landed in areas that are primarily unprotected. Of the fly balls with recorded exit velocities of 90 mph or higher, 71.8 percent landed in zones 4 and 5. And all of the line drives that left the bat at 90 mph or more landed in those same zones. That\u2019s the type of hit that injured the toddler at this year\u2019s Cubs-Astros game or that blinded a man in one eye at Wrigley Field in 2017.\n\nMajor league stadiums have slowly been installing more netting around the field. Players have been pushing the issue, including Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill, who called the MLB Players Association to voice his support for more protective netting. In 2015, MLB encouraged teams to extend netting to the \u201cnear ends of both dugouts.\u201d By 2018, all 30 stadiums had exceeded that recommendation, installing netting from one end of the dugout to the other. After the incident at Guaranteed Rate Field, the White Sox announced that they would implement netting from foul pole to foul pole, and crews worked during the All-Star break to install the new nets. The Washington Nationals also used the break to add netting.\n\nBut more netting won\u2019t protect every fan. Linda Goldbloom was sitting high above home plate in Dodger Stadium \u2014 in zone 1, where netting is provided \u2014 last year when she was struck and killed by a high fly ball that had an exit velocity of just 73 mph. And a woman at Tropicana Field was hospitalized in 2016 after she was hit by a fly ball that found its way through a hole in the netting just to the left of the first-base dugout.\n\nThe efforts that other leagues make to ensure the safety of their spectators could serve as a blueprint for MLB. Take the Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball Organization, where the stadiums have netting from foul pole to foul pole. Whenever a ball is hit into the stands, fans are warned with loud whistles blown by staff stationed in their seating section, and animated warning videos are played before every game. As a result, unprotected seats are something of a luxury in Japan. The Tokyo Dome offers \u201cexciting seats\u201d near the foul lines, which come equipped with helmets and gloves.\n\nEven with extensive netting, no one will ever be completely safe at a baseball game. But there are ways for MLB to protect its fans from foul balls \u2014 particularly in the most dangerous areas of the park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that you just hold your breath for a second,\u201d Hill told The Los Angeles Times. \u201cYou just hope it hits a seat, not a person.\u201d\n\nNeil Paine contributed research.\n\nCheck out our latest MLB predictions.\n\nCORRECTION (July 15, 2019, 5 p.m.): A previous version of this story referred to the data as having been collected from the 10 most foul-ball-heavy games this season. It was actually collected from the 10 most foul-ball-heavy game days \u2014 one day included a doubleheader.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-watched-906-foul-balls-to-find-out-where-the-most-dangerous-ones-land/", "author": ["Annette Choi"]}, {"title": "What Our Inbox Tells Us About How Democrats Are Tackling Trump", "text": "Democrats running for president in 2020 are faced with a choice when making their pitch to voters: make attacking President Trump a key part of their message or ignore him and focus on introducing themselves and their ideas.\n\nOn the one hand, criticizing Trump could help candidates convince primary voters that they\u2019re able to defeat him, but depending on what shots they choose to take, they could risk alienating voters in the general election. So we wanted to see how the candidates tackled this choice by looking at one of the most direct ways they regularly communicate with voters \u2014 their emails.\n\nLindsey Cormack, who runs the DCinbox project, a public database of email newsletters sent by members of Congress, says emails, like tweets, can give us insight into how politicians try to brand themselves. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to deal with editors at the paper. They don\u2019t have to deal with booking an agent to be on a TV or radio program. They can really say anything they want.\u201d\n\nSo to get a better sense of what the candidates told their followers about Trump, we subscribed to the mailing list of every candidate that FiveThirtyEight considers \u201cmajor\u201d and looked at all the emails they sent in the month prior to the first Democratic debate. (Though, for a variety of reasons \u2014 including email targeting practices, engagement testing techniques and the fact that we haven\u2019t given money to any of these campaigns \u2014 we may not have received all the emails sent by all the campaigns. )\n\nOverall, the candidates have taken very different approaches. Some candidates, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, seem to be ignoring Trump almost entirely, while others, like former Vice President Joe Biden, are heavily peppering their emails with invocations of Trump. Even some lesser-known candidates like Montana Gov. Steve Bullock are going all in on Trump \u2014 every email we received from his campaign during this period contained a reference to the president.\n\nBiden\u2019s emails contained the second-most mentions of Trump. In total, we received 27 messages from his campaign that referenced the president by name. This strong focus on Trump seems aimed at portraying Biden as a strong general election candidate, which makes sense, as his perceived \u201celectability\u201d has been a central argument of his campaign.\n\nIn his emails, Biden has attacked Trump\u2019s campaign tactics, his policy stances and his values. Biden has even sent an email that, rather than concentrating on his campaign, asked readers to sign a petition to \u201ctell Donald Trump that welcoming foreign interference in our elections is unacceptable.\u201d Even many of Biden\u2019s fundraising emails are all about Trump, asking readers to \u201cimagine the shock on Trump\u2019s face\u201d when they hit their fundraising goal and collect enough to \u201ccompete with Trump\u2019s fortunes.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden mentions Trump often, his emails completely ignore the rest of the primary field \u2014 none of his messages mention another Democratic candidate by name. Another thing Biden never mentions? Impeachment.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a telling omission, because many other candidates have called for Trump\u2019s impeachment and are renewing those calls in their emails. The move could help them in the primary election, as impeachment is popular among Democrats, but could prove risky in a general election because most polls find that more Americans oppose impeachment than support it.\n\nIn the month leading up to the first debate, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Cabinet secretary Julian Castro, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Sen. Cory Booker, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and former Gov. John Hickenlooper all sent at least one email entirely devoted to calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. O\u2019Rourke, for example, sent a long email on May 30 explaining why he thought Trump should be impeached, and then a punchier one about two weeks later with \u201cDonald Trump\u201d as the subject line and \u201c\u2026 should be impeached\u201d as the only text in the body of the email, with a link to a petition.\n\nWhile Warren was the first 2020 Democratic candidate to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2014 she publicly embraced that stance after the April release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 we didn\u2019t receive any emails from her campaign that mentioned the topic in the month before the first debate. Likewise, Sanders has also called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, but didn\u2019t send us any impeachment emails during the period we looked at.\n\nSome candidates largely avoided talking about Trump at all in the month before the debate. For example, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg only mentioned Trump in one email, when he called Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexican goods \u201cpolitically-motivated gamesmanship.\u201d Warren also was largely silent on Trump in this period. Of the 56 emails she sent us that month, only four mentioned Trump, and of those four, only one focused on him for the bulk of the message. That email explained, \u201cOur campaign isn\u2019t about Donald Trump. That\u2019s because he\u2019s just the symptom, not the cause, of the crises we face as a country.\u201d And Rep. Tim Ryan, who sent us 78 emails \u2014 the most of any candidate \u2014 didn\u2019t mention Trump even once, although he, too, has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nBullock, on the other hand, mentioned Trump in every single email, often as part of a formulaic reminder to subscribers that he is the only presidential candidate to have won statewide office in a state Trump won.\n\nCandidates who have a harder time making an \u201celectability\u201d argument than Bullock varied widely in the tenor of their emails that mentioned Trump. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, for example, sent us fewer emails in the month leading up to the debate than most candidates, but he mentioned Trump in five of the seven emails he did send us. (And one the two that didn\u2019t mention the president\u2019s last name still used the hashtag #ConDon, which showed up in six of de Blasio\u2019s emails and is meant to imply that Trump is a con man.) In many ways, De Blasio seemed to be trying to out-Trump Trump, aggressively attacking him and using name-calling tactics that the president is known for. In one email, for instance, he called Trump a \u201cNew York con man who\u2019s just been made to smell his own BS\u201d and referred to Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, as Trump\u2019s \u201clapdog,\u201d whose insults were \u201ceven lamer than his boss\u2019s.\u201d But unlike de Blasio, most of the Democratic contenders seemed to have heeded former First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s advice to \u201cgo high\u201d when their opponents \u201cgo low\u201d and are trying to strike a different tone than the current president, rather than trying to outdo him.\n\nSo what does this tell us about how Democrats are crafting (or not crafting) their campaigns around Trump? Well, a few candidates, like de Blasio, Bullock and Biden, are at one extreme \u2014 mentioning Trump at practically every opportunity \u2014 and a few, like Ryan and Buttigieg, are firmly planted at the other extreme, remaining largely silent on Trump. But perhaps unsurprisingly, most candidates fall somewhere in between, striking a balance between talking about Trump and focusing on their own message. It\u2019s early yet, though, and some candidates\u2019 communication strategies might change as the primary progresses. Still, with so many Democrats running, the party will have collectively tried out many different avenues of attack before the general election. Ultimately, however, there will only be one Democratic nominee, and whoever that is, he or she will have a wide pool of pre-tested approaches to draw from.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democrats-are-campaigning-on-trump/", "author": ["Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "A Better Way To Evaluate NBA Defense", "text": "Basketball, in some sense, is fundamentally a shooting game. Shooting isn\u2019t the only important action that takes place on a basketball court, obviously. But if no one kept track of who was taking shots and making buckets, we\u2019d have, at best, an extremely fuzzy impression of which players were actually any good, even if we had access to all their other statistics.\n\nBut believe it or not, this had long been the situation when it came to measuring player defense. There are individual defensive statistics such as rebounds and steals, of course. But there\u2019s no direct measure of shooting defense (other than blocks, which account for a relatively small fraction of missed shots). If an opponent gets hot against your team and shoots 53 for 91 en route to scoring 130 points, we know your team defended poorly in the aggregate, but we don\u2019t know which players to blame.\n\nThat is, until a few years ago, when the NBA started publishing data on opponents\u2019 shooting. Last regular season, for example, NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert defended a league-high 1,426 shots, according to motion tracking data by Second Spectrum, which identifies the nearest defender on every field goal attempt. Opponents made only 45 percent of those field goal attempts, well below the roughly 49 percent that Second Spectrum estimates \u201cshould\u201d have gone in against average defense for a given distance to the basket.\n\nWe\u2019ve been obsessed with this opponents\u2019 shooting data for a while, in part because it sometimes seemed to track closely with players who had stronger or weaker defensive reputations than you would infer from other advanced statistics such as Real Plus-Minus. Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving was regarded as a slightly above-average defender by RPM last year, for instance. But his opponents\u2019 shooting data suggests he\u2019s a big liability instead. On the other hand, Toronto\u2019s Serge Ibaka was an excellent defender based on opponents\u2019 shooting, whereas RPM regards him as just average.\n\nSo this year, we decided to evaluate the opponents\u2019 shooting data in a more comprehensive way and incorporate it into our projection system, CARMELO. Just as CARMELO is a goofy backronym (Career-Arc Regression Model Estimator with Local Optimization) that honors one of our favorite players, Carmelo Anthony, we decided to give our new defensive rating a player-centric name, this time in honor of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Draymond Green, who has long been one of the best players in basketball by opponent shooting. So our new rating is called DRAYMOND, which stands for\u2026.\n\nDefensive\n\nRating\n\nAccounting for\n\nYielding\n\nMinimal\n\nOpenness by\n\nNearest\n\nDefender\n\n\ud83d\ude44\n\nAll right, so the acronym may or may not catch on. But it does get at one essential discovery we made in playing around with the opponents\u2019 shooting data: the idea of minimizing openness. The main goal of shooting defense, especially in today\u2019s spacing-centric, ball-movement-forward offensive era, is really to minimize the chance of an open shot.\n\nSo when I cited Gobert\u2019s numbers earlier in this article, for instance, the most impressive part was not that opponents shot poorly against him, although that helped the Jazz, of course. Rather, it was that he was the nearest defender on so many shots: about 26 shots per 100 possessions that he was on the floor last year as compared with a league average of about 17 shots defended per 100 possessions. By contrast, Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook \u2014 whom DRAYMOND regards as being vastly overrated by other defensive metrics \u2014 was the nearest defender on only 12 shots per 100 possessions. Some of this has to do with Westbrook\u2019s and Gobert\u2019s respective positions \u2014 centers naturally defend more shots than guards do, a factor that DRAYMOND corrects for (see below). But even accounting for that, it\u2019s clear that some players are much more impactful defenders than others.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re curious to see some data, but first, an explanation of how DRAYMOND is calculated. We\u2019ll keep it pretty brief.\n\nAs I mentioned above, what we\u2019re really interested in is how much value a defender provides relative to an open shot. That is to say, we generally don\u2019t want to punish a player for happening to be the nearest defender according to the Second Spectrum data. Some defense is generally better than none; if Player X hadn\u2019t defended the shot, it\u2019s possible that no one else would have.\n\nThrough trial and error, we found that DRAYMOND performs best if you assume that shooting percentages on open shots are about 8 percentage points higher than against average defense. For instance, if a certain type of above-the-break 3-pointer is made 34 percent of the time against average defense, we\u2019d expect it to go in about 42 percent of the time if it was truly open.\n\nThis allows us to calculate an initial score that we call RAW_DRAYMOND. For example, if a player faced 100 2-point shots and allowed 46 of them to go in when you\u2019d expect 56 percent of them to be converted if wide open, that player prevented \u2026\n\n(.56-.46) x 100 x 2 = 20\n\n\u2026 about 20 points from being scored with his defense. (Obviously, this player could have provided additional value based on his defense against 3-point shots. Indeed, since 3-point shots are worth more than 2-pointers \u2014 hashtag #math \u2014 players who are effective at defending threes are especially rewarded by DRAYMOND.)\n\nHowever, there are several adjustments we need to make in getting from RAW_DRAYMOND to regular DRAYMOND:\n\nSince DRAYMOND is based on both regular-season and playoff data, we adjust for the fact that defenders face slightly tougher shooters on average in the playoffs.\n\nWe divide RAW_DRAYMOND by the number of possessions that the player was on the floor, so that DRAYMOND (like RPM and most other NBA stats) is a rate statistic rather than a counting statistic.\n\nWe adjust the number of shots defended based on a player\u2019s position. The average point guard and shooting guard defends about 15 shots per 100 possessions, the average small forward defends about 16 shots, the average power forward 19 shots, and the average center 22 shots. This somewhat equalizes defensive value over the five positions. Even so, bigs are generally the most valuable defenders in basketball according to DRAYMOND, as they are under most other advanced statistics.\n\nFinally, we subtract the value of league-average shooting defense per possession from each player\u2019s score. Thus, like RPM and Box Plus/Minus (BPM), the statistics that CARMELO has traditionally used to make its projections, DRAYMOND is a plus-minus statistic measured per 100 possessions, where a score of 0 represents average defense.\n\nAmong players who have played at least 10,000 possessions over the past six seasons (the NBA\u2019s opponents\u2019 shooting data goes back to 2013-14), the top defender according to DRAYMOND is \u2026 Draymond Green, who has provided the Warriors with +3.2 points per 100 possessions of defensive value based on his scoring defense alone, not counting all of the other ways (e.g., steals) that he produces defensive value. Green is followed on the list by a fairly star-studded cast of defenders: Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis (!), Rudy Gobert, Tim Duncan, Andre Roberson and Anthony Davis.

To test this \u2014 and I have to apologize because there are a lot of similarly named statistics here with confusing acronyms \u2014 we regressed DRAYMOND and defensive BPM against five-year defensive Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (RAPM). What the hell does that mean? BPM is based on conventional box score statistics \u2014 most importantly rebounds, blocks and steals for the purposes of measuring defense. DRAYMOND is based on opponents\u2019 shooting. RAPM, meanwhile, measures how much better or worse a team plays when a player is on or off the floor. In the long run, RAPM is basically the \u201cright\u201d way to measure player value, since it can account for all the direct and indirect contributions a player makes that may or may not have a corresponding statistic attached to them. In the short run and even the medium run, however (remember all that misleading data people cited about how the Warriors were so good without Kevin Durant?), RAPM can be extremely noisy. So RAPM is great if you\u2019re looking back over a five-year sample, as we\u2019re doing here, but on-court/off-court statistics need to be treated with extreme caution over small samples.\n\nIn any event, what we found is that BPM and DRAYMOND basically do equally well in predicting long-term RAPM. What that means is that the opponents\u2019 shooting data is basically as powerful as all box score defensive statistics combined in predicting how much value a player\u2019s defense truly has over the long run.\n\nWe also found, however, that BPM and DRAYMOND are largely not redundant with one another. Blocks, steals and rebounds, which BPM captures, are certainly valuable things, and DRAYMOND does not purport to measure those. But they are also not especially good proxies for shooting defense. There are some players such as Green and Gobert who are even better defenders than you\u2019d gather from their box score stats, even though those stats are pretty good. But there are others like Trevor Ariza, who gets lots of steals but has been rated poorly by DRAYMOND in recent seasons. That doesn\u2019t mean that Ariza is a poor defender, just that you need to take the good (steals) with the bad (allows opponents to convert field goals at a high rate) when evaluating him.\n\nLet\u2019s conclude with a list of players who are most affected, positively or negatively, by the incorporation of DRAYMOND. The table below compares our old CARMELO defensive ratings, which were based on a mix of two-thirds RPM and one-third BPM, to our new version, which still uses these statistics but also uses DRAYMOND. Here are the old and new defensive ratings for everyone with at least 10,000 possessions played since 2013-14.\n\nWhich players\u2019 defense had been underrated or overrated?

Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There\u2019s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic.\n\nCases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents\u2019 shooting data than what we\u2019ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.\n\nWe used math to help LeBron cast \u2018Space Jam 2\u2019\n\nCheck out our NBA player ratings.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-better-way-to-evaluate-nba-defense/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "The State Of The State Of The States", "text": "Whether it\u2019s a groundbreaking experiment of conservative or liberal thought or \u201cmerely\u201d tending to the bread-and-butter issues that touch residents\u2019 lives, the states are where the policymaking magic happens. And because of the different roles played by the state and federal governments, what\u2019s happening in the states can vary pretty substantially from what\u2019s being discussed on the national level. So we decided to burst out of the bubble of the national 2020 campaign and take a look at what state leaders were talking about.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, each governor lays out their policy priorities in their version of the State of the Union address \u2014 a \u201cstate of the state\u201d address. We conducted a text analysis of all 50 governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches to see what issues were talked about the most and whether there were differences between what Democratic and Republican governors were focusing on. Specifically, we broke down the speeches into one-, two- and three-word phrases (like \u201cschool\u201d or the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) and divided the most commonly used ones into thematic buckets.\n\nWe found that the three most dominant issues were education, health care and the economy \u2014 although Democratic and Republican governors didn\u2019t always approach them in the same way. There were also interesting partisan differences in how governors talked about some other issues, including the environment, crime and justice, and mental health.\n\nEducation\n\nThe words \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cschool\u201d appeared in all 23 Democratic speeches and all 27 Republican ones. But that doesn\u2019t mean the two parties focused on the same aspects of education. To suss out those differences, we ran a statistical analysis to determine how significantly terms were associated with speeches from Democratic or Republican governors. And as you can see in the table below, some terms (e.g., \u201cchild care,\u201d \u201ckindergarten\u201d) were more likely to be used in Democratic speeches, while others (e.g., \u201cfoster care,\u201d \u201ceducation workforce\u201d) were more likely to be used in Republican speeches.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on education One-, two- and three-word phrases about education that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nchild care 0.02 39.1% 7.4% D+31.7 education need 0.00 30.4 0.0 D+30.4 kindergarten 0.07 47.8 18.5 D+29.3 early childhood 0.06 43.5 14.8 D+28.7 educational 0.12 21.7 48.2 R+26.4 students state 0.01 26.1 0.0 D+26.1 scholarships 0.10 13.0 37.0 R+24.0 graduate 0.22 56.5 33.3 D+23.2 learning 0.27 43.5 66.7 R+23.2 educators deserve 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 foster care 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 quality education 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 school district 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 graduates 0.19 17.4 37.0 R+19.7 teacher pay 0.19 17.4 37.0 R+19.7 early childhood education 0.13 30.4 11.1 D+19.3 graduation 0.24 21.7 40.7 R+19.0 education workforce 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 college tuition 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 schools year 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 special education 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 tuition 0.29 43.5 25.9 D+17.6 scholarship 0.27 17.4 33.3 R+15.9 teacher 0.51 52.2 66.7 R+14.5 best brightest 0.15 4.4 18.5 R+14.2 year degree 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 training programs 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 children future 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 community college 0.40 34.8 22.2 D+12.6 teachers 0.62 82.6 70.4 D+12.2 classroom 0.55 52.2 40.7 D+11.4 school districts 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 universities 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 school students 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 graduate high school 0.35 21.7 11.1 D+10.6 young children 0.35 21.7 11.1 D+10.6 bachelor degree 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 children foster care 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 school student 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 school boards 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 parents teachers 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 teacher pay raise 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 high school college 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 public schools 0.56 43.5 33.3 D+10.2 class education 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 world class education 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 dedicated teachers 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 high schools 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 teacher salaries 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 computer science 0.52 17.4 25.9 R+8.5 high school 0.74 69.6 77.8 R+8.2 superintendent 0.59 21.7 29.6 R+7.9 students 0.79 100.0 92.6 D+7.4 educators 0.72 43.5 37.0 D+6.4 university 0.77 56.5 63.0 R+6.4 early education 0.55 17.4 11.1 D+6.3 help students 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 colleges 0.73 39.1 33.3 D+5.8 day kindergarten 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 education opportunity 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 school buildings 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 funding education 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 state college 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 technical education 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 students parents 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 student debt 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 post secondary 0.63 13.0 18.5 R+5.5 middle school 0.63 13.0 18.5 R+5.5 local school 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 stem 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 math 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 public school 0.76 21.7 25.9 R+4.2 higher education 0.84 47.8 51.9 R+4.0 college 0.88 73.9 77.8 R+3.9 education funding 0.78 26.1 22.2 D+3.9 apprenticeship 0.80 21.7 18.5 D+3.2 schools 0.91 95.7 92.6 D+3.1 apprenticeship programs 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 college degree 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 education budget 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 education programs 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 good education 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 graduation rate 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 12 schools 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 local school districts 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 students like 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 students graduate 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 elementary school 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 colleges universities 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 schools need 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 classrooms 0.93 39.1 40.7 R+1.6 schools state 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 teaching 0.96 30.4 29.6 D+0.8 public education 0.96 30.4 29.6 D+0.8 12 education 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 elementary 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 community colleges 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 high school students 0.99 26.1 25.9 D+0.2 education 1.00 100.0 100.0 EVEN school 1.00 100.0 100.0 EVEN Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

But on the state level, those ideas came up in only a handful of gubernatorial speeches \u2014 mostly Democratic ones. Democratic governors were more loquacious about another progressive priority, \u201cearly childhood education,\u201d which was mentioned by seven Democratic governors and three Republican ones.\n\nHealth care\n\nAnother issue governors talked a lot about was health care \u2014 especially Democratic governors. That makes sense considering that health care was the No. 1 issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, which is when many of those Democratic governors were elected.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on health care One-, two- and three-word phrases about health care that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nsick 0.01 39.1% 3.7% D+35.4 affordable care act 0.01 39.1 3.7 D+35.4 health care 0.25 100.0 70.4 D+29.6 healthy 0.15 60.9 33.3 D+27.5 expand medicaid 0.02 30.4 3.7 D+26.7 access health 0.06 30.4 7.4 D+23.0 reproductive health 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 pre existing conditions 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 cost health 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 existing conditions 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 hospital 0.19 43.5 22.2 D+21.3 medical 0.32 65.2 44.4 D+20.8 epidemic 0.17 39.1 18.5 D+20.6 dr 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 access health care 0.10 26.1 7.4 D+18.7 health outcomes 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 health insurance 0.29 43.5 25.9 D+17.6 hospitals 0.26 34.8 18.5 D+16.3 doctor 0.24 30.4 14.8 D+15.6 health care costs 0.21 26.1 11.1 D+15.0 affordable health care 0.18 21.7 7.4 D+14.3 expanded medicaid 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 healthier 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 public health 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 behavioral health 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 health services 0.57 30.4 22.2 D+8.2 health 0.79 100.0 92.6 D+7.4 medicaid 0.74 52.2 59.3 R+7.1 quality health care 0.55 17.4 11.1 D+6.3 medicaid program 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 children health 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 health crisis 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 health challenges 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 illness 0.80 21.7 18.5 D+3.2 health substance 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 medicaid expansion 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

A lower p-value means that the partisanship of a phrase in our data set is more statistically distinguishable. Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nDemocratic governors were more likely than Republican ones to utter almost every health care-related phrase we looked at. For instance, more Democratic governors (nine of them, or 39 percent) used the phrase \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d (the health care law passed under former President Barack Obama) than Republican governors (one, or 4 percent). And four Democratic governors called for their states to \u201cexpand Medicaid\u201d \u2014 all of them, perhaps unsurprisingly, in states with divided government (where the governor, state Senate and/or state House are controlled by different parties). This could be because Medicaid expansion has recently passed in several red states and is broadly popular, making it a fertile issue for bipartisan cooperation. Or it could be simply because every Democratic-controlled state has expanded Medicaid already.\n\nMostly missing, however, from all the health care talk was an endorsement of a single-payer health-insurance system \u2014 a major policy priority of some Democratic presidential candidates. Democrat Gavin Newsom of California was the only governor to mention \u201csingle payer\u201d health care, or the idea that the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care with private insurance plans effectively eliminated, but he mentioned it only as a \u201clong-term goal.\u201d Likewise, only Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington urged his legislature to create a \u201cpublic health option,\u201d which would give people the ability to buy into a government-administered insurance plan. (His state went on this year to pass legislation that created this option.)\n\nThe economy\n\nThe third nearly ubiquitous issue in state of the state addresses was the economy. While rhetoric about jobs was bipartisan (\u201cjob\u201d or \u201cjobs\u201d appeared in every speech), Republican and Democratic governors approached other aspects of economic policy differently.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on the economy One-, two- and three-word phrases about the economy that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how

Interestingly, eight of the nine were speaking to a friendly (i.e., Democratic) legislature, indicating how raising the minimum wage is a priority for Democratic-controlled states.\n\nEnergy and the environment\n\nWe found differences among Republican and Democratic speeches on other policy issues as well.

There was a similar partisan split (11 to one) in calls for \u201cclean energy.\u201d By contrast, Republicans tended to framed their environmental goals around protecting \u201cnatural resources\u201d (a phrase that appeared in eight GOP speeches and three Democratic ones).\n\nCriminal justice\n\nCriminal-justice reform seems to be one of the few remaining bipartisan issues these days, and, fittingly, the term \u201ccriminal justice\u201d appeared in 13 Republican speeches and in 12 Democratic ones.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on criminal justice One-, two- and three-word phrases about criminal justice that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nprison 0.01 21.7% 74.1% R+52.3 enforcement 0.03 21.7 63.0 R+41.2 law enforcement 0.03 21.7 63.0 R+41.2 gun violence 0.00 34.8 0.0 D+34.8 public safety 0.10 30.4 63.0 R+32.5 corrections 0.04 8.7 37.0 R+28.3 violence 0.13 52.2 25.9 D+26.2 gun safety 0.01 26.1 0.0 D+26.1 prisons 0.10 13.0 37.0 R+24.0 school safety 0.06 4.4 25.9 R+21.6 correctional 0.14 13.0 33.3 R+20.3 gun 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 attorney general 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 local law enforcement 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 schools safer 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 prison population 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 crime 0.28 26.1 44.4 R+18.4 violent 0.32 21.7 37.0 R+15.3 offenders 0.38 17.4 29.6 R+12.2 criminal 0.62 52.2 63.0 R+10.8 violent crime 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 non violent 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 police officer 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 law enforcement officers 0.45 13.0 22.2 R+9.2 police officers 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 criminal justice reform 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 victims 0.76 21.7 25.9 R+4.2 criminal justice 0.84 52.2 48.2 D+4.0 state police 0.82 17.4 14.8 D+2.6 violent offenders 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 recidivism rate 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 police 0.96 43.5 44.4 R+1.0 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nBut Republican governors also lived up to their party\u2019s historical \u201ctough on crime\u201d reputation, at least through their rhetoric. For instance, they were far more likely to nod to \u201cpublic safety,\u201d a phrase used by 17 GOP governors but seven Democrats. And while 17 Republicans mentioned \u201claw enforcement\u201d in their state of the state addresses, only five Democrats did. Republicans also talked more about \u201cprisons\u201d and \u201ccorrections\u201d than Democrats did \u2014 however, their language surrounding it wasn\u2019t always \u201ctough.\u201d For example, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds touted her state\u2019s apprenticeship programs that try to reintegrate inmates in society: \u201cMost of our inmates aren\u2019t inmates for life. They will reenter society \u2014 and when they do, we want them to be successful. Those who can\u2019t get a job often find their way back to crime and then back to prison.\u201d Several other Republican governors discussed the need to reduce their \u201cprison population.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, it was mostly Democratic governors who talked about guns. For example, eight Democratic governors used the term \u201cgun violence,\u201d but no Republicans did so. Notably, only two Republican governors even mentioned the \u201cSecond Amendment.\u201d More frequently, Republicans talked about guns in the context of \u201cschool safety,\u201d a phrase used in seven GOP speeches and one Democratic one.\n\nMental health\n\nMore Republican governors (18) than Democratic ones (10) used the phrase \u201cmental health\u201d in their state of the state addresses, and a third of those Republicans \u2014 six of the 18 \u2014 did so in the context of violence in schools. For example, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said, \u201cTo keep our classrooms safe, we must also address the mental health issues that often lead to school violence.\u201d\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on mental health One-, two- and three-word phrases about mental health that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nmental health 0.27 43.5% 66.7% R+23.2 drugs 0.24 21.7 40.7 R+19.0 drug 0.44 43.5 59.3 R+15.8 addiction 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 mental health issues 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 opioid addiction 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 overdose 0.57 26.1 18.5 D+7.6 opioid 0.71 47.8 40.7 D+7.1 substance 0.69 30.4 37.0 R+6.6 mental health care 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 substance use 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 opioid crisis 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 substance abuse 0.78 26.1 22.2 D+3.9 mental health substance 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 mental health services 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 mental illness 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

A lower p-value means that the partisanship of a phrase in our data set is more statistically distinguishable. Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nOther Republicans spoke about mental health more broadly. For instance, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu discussed overhauling the state\u2019s mental health care system and reducing suicide rates. And four Republican governors brought up mental health in the context of drug addiction. Republicans were also likelier than Democrats to discuss \u201copioid addiction,\u201d but \u201copioid\u201d overall was relatively common in both Democratic and Republican speeches.\n\nAs for immigration and abortion, two issues that have recently been prominent on the national level, we didn\u2019t find a lot of discussion of them in the governors\u2019 speeches. Only three gubernatorial speeches included the word \u201cimmigration,\u201d and related terms were similarly rare. When they did come up, there was a noticeable partisan divide: For example, Democrats were more likely to use the word \u201cimmigrants\u201d (four speeches to two), while Republicans were more likely to reference the \u201cborder\u201d (five speeches to one). Similarly, just two governors mentioned abortion: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, who is a supporter of abortion rights, and Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, who is against abortion. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that state governments aren\u2019t legislating on abortion \u2014 we know that they are \u2014 but it\u2019s notable that so few governors mentioned it in their speeches.\n\nSetting partisan differences aside, a lot of governors agreed on one thing in particular: that the state of their state was strong! Of the dozens of governors who included the phrase \u201cthe state of our state is \u2026\u201d in their state of the state address, at least 16 followed it with \u201cstrong\u201d or some variation thereof \u2014 including \u201cstronger than ever,\u201d \u201cgrowing stronger each day\u201d and \u201chopeful, prosperous and strong.\u201d Others were more creative and said the state of their state was \u201csolid,\u201d \u201crock solid,\u201d \u201cfull of opportunity\u201d or \u201cdetermined.\u201d But a few were \u2026 less confident: \u201cThe state of our state is improving\u201d (ouch, Kansas); \u201cthe state of our state is that we\u2019ve got work to do\u201d (better get cracking, Wisconsin!).\n\nLaura Bronner contributed analysis.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americas-governors-are-talking-about/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich", "Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "Which 2020 Candidates Have The Most In Common \u2026 On Twitter?", "text": "The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates use Twitter like an earlier generation of politicians may have used a soapbox: to announce policy plans, solicit donations, marshal their supporters and criticize the current administration.\n\nEach of these candidates is speaking to his or her own virtual village square. But how many people spend time in more than one village? How much overlap is there between, say, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s audience and Bernie Sanders\u2019s? And which candidates are most often associated with one another, based on their Twitter followers?\n\nTwitter isn\u2019t real life, of course; it\u2019s an often-ridiculous short-burst social network that is decidedly not representative of the electorate at large. But it\u2019s still a slice of life. The people following candidates on Twitter are those who want to receive a steady stream of information about at least part of the 2020 campaign. Understanding how that tribe operates can tell us something about an influential slice of the electorate.\n\nSo off our web-scraper went, dredging up every follower of the 20 Democratic presidential candidates who FiveThirtyEight considered \u201cmajor\u201d in early May, when we ran our script. The result was a data set with almost 20 million entries, which you can download on GitHub.\n\nThis data reveals the obvious, such as raw follower counts. It also reveals more subtle trends, such as which candidates\u2019 followers are loyal, which cast a broad net, which seem to have a similar appeal and which apparently have nothing in common.\n\nFor starters, here are the candidates ranked by the share of their followers who don\u2019t follow any other 2020 Democratic candidate.\n\nCandidates whose followers are loyal only to them Share of each 2020 candidate\u2019s followers who don\u2019t follow any other candidates Account \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nFOLLOWERS \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nExclusive FOLLOWERS \u25b2 \u25bc\n\n@marwilliamson 2,610,335 \u2013 74.8% \u2013 \u2013 @BernieSanders 9,254,423 \u2013 63.2 \u2013 \u2013 @Hickenlooper 144,816 \u2013 56.3 \u2013 \u2013 @CoryBooker 4,246,252 \u2013 52.5 \u2013 \u2013 @JoeBiden 3,558,333 \u2013 43.8 \u2013 \u2013 @AndrewYang 267,897 \u2013 43.4 \u2013 \u2013 @TulsiGabbard 349,443 \u2013 34.7 \u2013 \u2013 @BetoORourke 1,424,745 \u2013 26.5 \u2013 \u2013 @amyklobuchar 692,985 \u2013 24.0 \u2013 \u2013 @PeteButtigieg 1,033,834 \u2013 23.7 \u2013 \u2013 @SenGillibrand 1,410,303 \u2013 23.3 \u2013 \u2013 @KamalaHarris 2,640,072 \u2013 22.3 \u2013 \u2013 @JulianCastro 212,582 \u2013 21.4 \u2013 \u2013 @sethmoulton 138,450 \u2013 20.1 \u2013 \u2013 @JayInslee 51,504 \u2013 19.0 \u2013 \u2013 @ewarren 2,486,101 \u2013 16.4 \u2013 \u2013 @TimRyan 20,080 \u2013 15.6 \u2013 \u2013 @JohnDelaney 20,266 \u2013 12.9 \u2013 \u2013 @MichaelBennet 21,053 \u2013 11.7 \u2013 \u2013 @ericswalwell 84,415 \u2013 9.2 \u2013 \u2013 Among candidates who were considered \u201cmajor\u201d by FiveThirtyEight as of May 8. Follower lists for each candidate\u2019s primary accounts (according to a CSPAN Twitter list) were scraped from May 8-15, except for @Hickenlooper, which was scraped on June 6 to correct a coding error.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of the people who follow Marianne Williamson \u2014 a \u201cspiritual and inspirational author, lecturer, non-profit activist,\u201d per her Twitter bio \u2014 don\u2019t follow any other Democratic candidate, putting them in a loyalty class all their own. Similarly, of the over 9 million people who follow Bernie Sanders, almost two-thirds follow no other candidate.\n\nThe 2.5 million people who follow Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, are more gregarious \u2014 84 percent of them follow at least one of her Democratic rivals. Ditto the 2.6 million people who follow Kamala Harris, 78 percent of whom also follow another candidate.\n\nDigging a little deeper into the follower interaction information, we can find out, for example, which other candidates Warren\u2019s followers are paying attention to. The Venn diagrams below try to answer that question, showing the overlap in followers between every candidate who had more than 500,000 followers in early May.\n\nThis chart reveals relatively large intersections between followers of Sanders and Warren, who share progressive policy platforms; between followers of Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke, who are both young, male and white; and between Harris and other major female candidates such as Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nFollower overlap patterns seem to share some similarities with Democrats\u2019 vote preferences, too. Morning Consult has been tracking voters\u2019 second-choice candidates, and according to the latest poll, respondents who planned to vote for Warren said their top backup choices were Harris and Sanders. Similarly, on Twitter, 60 percent of Warren\u2019s followers also follow Sanders, and 37 percent each follow Harris and Biden \u2014 her largest overlap groups.\n\nWith some simple calculations, we can look past the sheer size of each Twitter overlap and get a sense for which pairs of candidates share some quality (ideology, Twitter skills, who knows) that makes them appeal to the same people. Theoretically, people could be following multiple presidential candidates at random, but that\u2019s not how Twitter really works \u2014 if one account speaks to my interests, I\u2019m likely to be interested in similar accounts.\n\nTo figure out which candidates are getting paired up more often than we\u2019d expect based on chance alone, we rely on a number that data miners call \u201clift,\u201d which is the ratio of how many followers a pair actually has to how many followers we\u2019d expect them to have based solely on their individual Twitter popularity. For example, say we have 100 total Twitter users, and 50 of them follow Sanders while 10 of them follow Warren. If the reasons that a person followed Sanders had nothing to do with the reasons they followed Warren, we\u2019d expect the overlap between the two to be five users. If it turns out that 10 users follow both Warren and Sanders, then we have a lift value of two (twice as many as expected), which means we can speculate that the two candidates share some quality that appeals to the same people. If only one user follows both, then we have a lift of 0.2 (one-fifth as many as expected), and we would suspect that there\u2019s something about each candidate that drives away some people who follow the other candidate.\n\nIn the chart below, candidate pairs are organized by lift value, so those above the dotted line have more followers in common than you\u2019d expect by chance while those below the line have fewer.\n\nSome of the pairs that float above the line on this chart also stood out in the Venn diagrams, such as Harris and Warren, Harris and Gillibrand and O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg. O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro also have a relatively large overlap, perhaps because they\u2019re both from Texas. The small dots at the very top capture overlaps that are tens of times larger than we\u2019d expect to see if the candidates\u2019 appeals to followers were unrelated. That\u2019s probably because users who follow one lesser-known candidate such as Michael Bennet or John Delaney are likely to be highly engaged in the race and follow the other candidates as well. For example, the average Delaney follower also follows more than six other Democratic candidates.\n\nThe chart also reveals the candidate pairs who are not followed together. Williamson appears in most of these pairs, but the combination of Sanders and Booker also sinks to the bottom; their follower overlap is about half the size of what we\u2019d expect given their individual popularity.\n\nTwitter is just one front on which the fight for the Democratic nomination is being waged, but it does provide some insight into how candidates are using social media and who is listening. Democrats are, after all, looking for a candidate who can beat President Trump, who redefined how we view Silicon Valley\u2019s little blue bird.\n\nWe want to hear how you\u2019re using this data!

Questions, comments or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nA separation-of-powers showdown has been brewing since Democrats took control of the House in January. And with two new lawsuits directly attacking House Democrats\u2019 oversight authority, President Trump is now challenging whether one of Congress\u2019s most potent checks on the executive branch can be used to probe his finances.\n\nOver the past month, several House committees have issued subpoenas to banks with ties to Trump and an accounting firm that prepared several years of his financial statements, demanding a variety of documents. Trump has already declared that the White House won\u2019t cooperate with any of the Democrats\u2019 investigations, but he has little control over whether an external organization like a bank complies with a congressional subpoena. So he sued the banks, the accounting firm and House oversight committee Chairman Elijah Cummings. Trump is asking the courts to invalidate the subpoenas and arguing that they are an illegitimate exercise of Congress\u2019s oversight power.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold \u2014 and possibly even unprecedented \u2014 argument. Several legal experts told me that this appears to be the first time a sitting president has responded to a congressional inquiry by suing a member of Congress. They predicted that the cases will likely be difficult to win in court. Instead, they said, the lawsuits\u2019 real power lies in politics and delay: They help Trump feed a political argument that House Democrats are unfairly persecuting him, while the subpoenas could be tied up in the courts for months or even years. And the ripple effects could be much bigger \u2014 if Trump successfully evades congressional scrutiny in these cases and others, future presidents could be emboldened to challenge Congress in similar ways.\n\nDemocrats are arguing that the contested subpoenas to Deutsche Bank, Capital One and Mazars USA, the accounting firm, fall squarely under their oversight powers. Congress can conduct investigations related to legislation and the functioning of the executive branch, and Democrats say they\u2019re trying to learn whether Trump or his businesses are dependent on Russian money in a way that could influence his presidential decision-making. They\u2019ve also said the banking subpoenas are part of a broader effort to determine whether the banks are helping Russian clients get money out of Russia. This wider investigation could theoretically trigger further congressional action if it reveals that the banks were involved in illicit money laundering.\n\nBut Trump is arguing that Democrats are seeking details of his private financial dealings merely to score political points and that the subpoenas to the banks violate privacy laws. In the lawsuit against Cummings and the accounting firm, Trump\u2019s lawyers say that Democrats have \u201cdeclared all-out political war\u201d against the president, with subpoenas as \u201ctheir weapons of choice,\u201d and are trying \u201cto expose [Trump\u2019s] private financial information for the sake of exposure.\u201d And in the lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One, they write that the subpoenas are intended to \u201charass\u201d Trump and \u201cferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage.\u201d\n\nThese claims of overreach might play well with Trump\u2019s base, but the case itself is a long shot, said Cornell University law professor Josh Chafetz, who studies the relationship between Congress and the executive branch. \u201cCongress has incredibly broad oversight powers, and there are any number of areas where these records could be relevant,\u201d he said.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a completely open-and-shut case, however. Lance Cole, a law professor at Penn State University and an expert on congressional investigations, said that because courts have ruled in the past that Congress can\u2019t use its power to peer into citizens\u2019 private lives without some legitimate justification, a judge might be sympathetic to Trump\u2019s argument, particularly if Democrats are asking for lots of old financial documents. However, in the 1990s, Congress probed the details of a 15-year-old real estate deal involving Bill and Hillary Clinton as part of the Whitewater investigation, dredging up personal details from long before Clinton was president. That may bolster the argument that a president can\u2019t really be compared with an ordinary citizen. \u201cYou can debate the merits of the investigation, but it\u2019s hard for Trump to say that Congress has never done this before,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t need to prevail in these cases to deal the Democrats a significant setback, however \u2014 he just needs to ensure that the lawsuits are not immediately dismissed. That\u2019s because it can take months for a case to wend its way through the judicial bureaucracy before it goes to trial, and the subpoenas will likely be put on hold until the case is resolved. \u201cIt\u2019s completely possible we won\u2019t have an answer until after the 2020 election,\u201d said Margaret Taylor, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nSo the lawsuits are likely to help Trump whether or not he ultimately wins them. In the short term, they\u2019re feeding a broader political narrative of Democratic overreach. In the medium term \u2014 possibly through the entire election cycle \u2014 they will delay Democrats\u2019 efforts to access his financial records. The million-dollar question is what the impact will be on our political system in the long term. Taylor told me that it\u2019s deeply unusual for a president to argue that he\u2019s simply not subject to congressional oversight. \u201cSince Watergate, presidents have had their disagreements with Congress, but they have recognized that Congress has a valid oversight role,\u201d she said.\n\nRegardless of what happens with Trump\u2019s finances, this fight could be a sign of things to come. \u201cIf Trump continues to stonewall and the Democrats don\u2019t push back or their pushback is ineffective, future presidents will decide that they basically aren\u2019t answerable to Congress unless they want to be,\u201d Chafetz said.\n\nOther cases\n\nPresident Trump\n\nA case alleging that Trump is unconstitutionally accepting \u201cemoluments\u201d from foreign countries will be allowed to move forward. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that congressional Democrats\u2019 definition of emolument \u2014 which broadly encompasses any gift or payment from a foreign power \u2014 is more convincing than Trump\u2019s attorneys\u2019 narrower definition of an emolument as a payment received for services performed in the president\u2019s official capacity. Another emoluments case filed by the attorneys general of D.C. and Maryland is currently pending in an appeals court, but the scope of the Democrats\u2019 lawsuit is much broader \u2014 rather than focusing on Trump\u2019s Washington, D.C., hotel, it implicates all of Trump\u2019s businesses worldwide.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nOne of the cases challenging Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs, who said they were withdrawing from the suit because the money obtained through the declaration wouldn\u2019t be used to build barriers in the places where their clients are located. Many other lawsuits involving the national emergency declaration are ongoing.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments in April on a case about whether the Trump administration can add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Many observers reported that the court\u2019s conservative majority seemed willing to allow the addition of the question.\n\nThe Department of Justice filed a brief in a case involving the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, arguing that the entire law is unconstitutional, which is a reversal of its previous position that some, but not all, of the ACA should be struck down. A federal district court judge in Texas ruled in December that the ACA is unconstitutional because a 2017 law removed the tax penalty for not having health insurance. The case is now pending appeal.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland denied the Trump administration\u2019s request to dismiss a new set of lawsuits against the travel ban to the U.S. by residents of seven countries, including several where most of the citizens are Muslim. The Supreme Court allowed the policy to take effect last summer, but the new travel ban lawsuits are challenging the legality of its design and enforcement. The judge\u2019s ruling will allow the plaintiffs to obtain evidence about how the process of administering the ban is unfolding.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration pushes back against Democrats", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-trumps-latest-lawsuits-keep-congress-from-investigating-future-presidents/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Trump Is Losing The Legal Fight Against Sanctuary Cities, But It May Still Pay Off Politically", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nOn Friday, a federal appeals court handed down another setback for President Trump\u2019s effort to crack down on sanctuary cities, a campaign pledge that he has been fighting to fulfill since his first few days in office. The judges in the case ruled that the Trump administration could not withhold federal law-enforcement funds from cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents. The ruling came down on the same day that Trump declared a national emergency to secure funding to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 another effort to fulfill a key campaign promise, and one that will almost certainly be mired in a lengthy legal process where a win is far from guaranteed.\n\nWhy is the president so willing to dig in and risk legal defeat when it comes to his signature immigration issues? It might be because without cooperation from Congress, Trump\u2019s best shot at fulfilling some of his key campaign promises is to take bold \u2014 and possibly unconstitutional \u2014 actions and hope for a victory in the courts. Even a series of losses might seem better, from a political perspective, than doing nothing. As Christopher Lasch, a law professor at the University of Denver, told me, \u201cTo the extent that he can tell his base he\u2019s trying to do something, that\u2019s a win for Trump \u2014 regardless of how the cases turn out.\u201d In the case of sanctuary cities, what\u2019s at stake is the balance of power between the federal government and state and local authorities \u2014 and so far, judges have almost uniformly sided against the federal government.\n\nFrom the beginning, Trump and his administration have been fighting an uphill battle against sanctuary cities. Judges across the country \u2014 appointed by both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 have rejected several attempts by the administration to yank federal funding from cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration-enforcement efforts, and a federal judge in California refused the administration\u2019s request to suspend the state\u2019s sanctuary laws. \u201cThey\u2019ve been roundly defeated again and again,\u201d said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University.\n\nMany of these cases revolve around a federal law that says cities and states can\u2019t forbid their employees from communicating with federal agents about the immigration status of people in their jurisdiction. An executive order issued by Trump in his first few days in office and the conditions later placed by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions on law-enforcement grants both make federal funding at least partially contingent on compliance with federal agents. But legal experts told me that it\u2019s unconstitutional for a president to try to attach these kinds of strings to funding, because Congress controls spending and therefore only Congress has the power to impose conditions on federal grants. The law itself may also be unconstitutional under the 10th Amendment, which shields states\u2019 rights. Several judges have made this point in their rulings, relying on a 2018 Supreme Court decision that was authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito and overturned a federal sports gambling law on the grounds that it was \u201ccommandeering\u201d the states to enforce federal laws.\n\nThese recent lower-court rulings may have been predictable \u2014 at least to legal experts. But the Trump administration pressed on anyway, perhaps because the success of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda partially depends on his ability to get local law enforcement to work with federal agents. It\u2019s hard for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to locate undocumented immigrants without the help of state or local police.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more cost effective and efficient for ICE to pick people up who\u2019ve already been arrested and held in the local jail than to go find them in their home or elsewhere,\u201d said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. According to a 2018 report from his organization, 69 percent of ICE arrests during the first 135 days of the Trump administration were based on transfers from the criminal-justice system. The institute also found that California\u2019s share of overall ICE arrests fell after statewide sanctuary policies were implemented, while the share of arrests rose in some other parts of the country.\n\nGiven this context, it makes sense that the Trump administration would continue to fight sanctuary cities, despite the administration\u2019s string of defeats so far. And Trump may be banking on a more favorable hearing at the Supreme Court, which ultimately upheld his ban on travel to the U.S. from a number of countries, including several where the majority of the population is Muslim, after a series of losses in the lower courts. Most of the legal experts I spoke with were skeptical, though, that the justices would be willing to take the cases involving conditions on federal grants unless the administration wins in at least one appellate court.\n\nBut if the goal is to demonstrate to Trump\u2019s base that he\u2019s working to fulfill a key campaign promise, his record in the courts may not really matter. Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which seeks to decrease immigration to the U.S., said that Trump faces significant pressure from his base to do something \u2014 anything \u2014 to fight back against sanctuary cities, which is why it could be more politically costly to back down than to continue losing. \u201cThe people who support increased immigration enforcement are very frustrated with this status quo, and they want to see the Trump administration take it as far as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd the president may simply feel that he doesn\u2019t have much to lose by continuing to fight. Taking a few more defeats on sanctuary cities won\u2019t change much right away, since the administration is already losing across the board. It\u2019s possible that if California\u2019s sanctuary law is ultimately upheld, more states will decide to pass similar legislation, but that process would take time. And by tying state and local governments up in expensive legal battles, the administration could end up deterring some smaller or less firmly Democratic cities from enacting sanctuary policies, Lasch said.\n\n\u201cEven if he keeps losing, that reinforces the narrative that the Trump administration is trying to enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws and the courts are against them,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro, director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute. Trump could be making a similar calculation about declaring a national emergency: Settling in for a series of defeats in the short term could turn out to be a successful political strategy in the long run.\n\nOther cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nA federal judge ruled that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort intentionally lied to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, in violation of his plea agreement. As a result, Manafort\u2019s plea deal is no longer in effect, which means he could spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Roger Stone is now under a limited gag order issued by the same judge after Stone went on a media blitz last month discussing his indictment and arrest as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation. Then Stone posted a picture to Instagram that included a picture of the judge\u2019s face with crosshairs in the background, prompting the judge to schedule a hearing for Thursday to discuss the conditions of his release. Stone apologized to the judge and took the image down, but she indicated that his release on bail could now be in jeopardy.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nLast spring, a judge ruled that Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked people from viewing or replying to his posts on Twitter. Trump appealed the case to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where oral arguments were recently scheduled for March 26.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nOn Friday, another case involving Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 which removes the threat of deportation from certain undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children \u2014 will be argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Last spring in the same case, a federal District Court judge ruled that Trump\u2019s reasons for revoking the program were \u201cvirtually unexplained\u201d and the revocation was therefore illegal.\n\nWilliam Barr was confirmed as attorney general on Thursday, triggering the dismissal of several challenges to acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker\u2019s appointment last November.\n\nLast Friday, Trump declared the situation on the country\u2019s southern border to be a national emergency in order to secure funds to build a long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico. On Monday, the attorneys general of 16 states sued the president, arguing that his declaration violates the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. Another lawsuit has been filed against the president by an environmental organization and several landowners in south Texas who say they\u2019ll be affected by the construction of the wall, in addition to a separate lawsuit filed by several environmental and animal rights groups. A watchdog group is also suing the Department of Justice for failing to provide records related to the president\u2019s legal authority to invoke a national emergency. All of these cases have been added to the latest update of the Trump Docket data set.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s national emergency faces legal pushback", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-losing-the-legal-fight-against-sanctuary-cities-but-it-may-still-pay-off-politically/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Should Judges Pay Attention To Trump\u2019s Tweets?", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power.

His unfiltered public statements on Twitter and elsewhere have been a gift to the organizations and advocates fighting a range of controversial policy decisions like his proposal to ban most transgender people from serving in the military and the revocation of a temporary form of legal status for migrants who fled violence and natural disasters. Litigants have drawn on Trump\u2019s comments to argue that the administration was driven by bigotry and prejudice, rather than legitimate national-security or other policy concerns. The administration contends, meanwhile, that normal procedures were followed and that the policy decisions that resulted were the product of thorough deliberations.\n\nAnd this means that judges have to decide whether to take the administration\u2019s explanation at face value without addressing whatever Trump has said \u2014 or to evaluate Trump\u2019s comments as a crucial part of the story.

In many of those rulings, judges relied on the president\u2019s tweets and statements to conclude that the government\u2019s national security rationale simply wasn\u2019t convincing. But when the case made it to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts took a very different tack. Roberts upheld the travel ban, and in his majority opinion, he acknowledged Trump\u2019s comments about Muslims but ultimately concluded that Trump\u2019s order was grounded in legitimate national-security concerns.\n\nTo some extent, this approach was expected. In cases involving immigration, foreign affairs and national security, courts commonly defer to the president\u2019s authority when considering whether a particular action was valid. \u201cWhat\u2019s head-spinning about Trump is that there are a lot of cases where \u2026 there doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of room for doubt about his intentions,\u201d said Richard Primus, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Michigan.\n\nIn the past, presidents might have had all kinds of ulterior motives for pursuing or supporting a particular policy, but they didn\u2019t say them at news conferences or on TV. \u201cUntil now, the executive branch has been kind of a black box,\u201d said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law. \u201cTrump is giving courts all kinds of insights that they might not have had in the past.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not necessarily clear what courts are supposed to do with those insights. In my conversation with Primus, he seemed skeptical that the Supreme Court would start probing Trump\u2019s motives in future cases. \u201cI think they will continue to insist on acting like they don\u2019t know the president\u2019s motivating attitudes,\u201d he said. If the court were to deviate from its typical practice in response to Trump\u2019s unusual behavior, it could create an awkward situation if the next president is more traditional \u2014 does the court revert to its previous practice or stick with the new approach? But staying the course has risks, Primus said \u2014 ignoring a president\u2019s motivation could lead to abuses of power in the present and the future.\n\nThe travel ban ruling now hangs over cases currently unfolding in the lower courts over DACA (a program originally created by President Obama that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation), the status of immigrants from Haiti and other countries, and the restrictions on transgender servicemembers. In each, Trump\u2019s tweets or statements are being used as evidence of discriminatory intent by the administration. And the administration\u2019s opponents are arguing that the government\u2019s actions were illegal in at least one of two ways: They violated the procedures set forth for administrative agencies, including a requirement that decision-making not be \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious,\u201d or they violated the constitutional rights of the people who were affected.\n\nSo far, lower court judges have seemed open to these arguments, but it\u2019s still early in the process. In one lawsuit related to the status of Haitian immigrants who fled to the U.S. after a 2010 earthquake, a judge issued an injunction last fall preventing the Trump administration from terminating the immigrants\u2019 legal status. In the ruling, the judge cited something Trump reportedly said in a meeting about a year ago suggesting that the U.S. might be better off prioritizing immigrants from Norway over migrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d like Haiti, El Salvador and Nigeria. He said that comment, along with another instance in which Trump reportedly said that 15,000 recent immigrants from Haiti \u201call have AIDS,\u201d raised \u201cserious questions\u201d about whether the administration\u2019s decision \u201cwas influenced by the White House and based on animus against non-white, non-European immigrants in violation of Equal Protection guaranteed by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nBut whether one of these cases will prompt the Supreme Court to be clearer about when \u2014 and how \u2014 a president\u2019s statements, and what they might suggest about his motivations, are relevant for the courts remains a big question. Nearly all the legal experts I spoke with emphasized that there are good reasons for courts to refrain from frequently probing the executive branch\u2019s motives \u2014 including the fact that they\u2019re often ruling on highly technical questions where administration officials, not judges, are the experts. And questioning presidential motives on a more routine basis could lead judges into situations where they appear to be making political decisions. \u201cThe risk here is that the courts become too involved in political debates,\u201d said Gillian Metzger, a law professor at Columbia University.\n\nAnd so in the meantime, the judges puzzling through these issues in their courtrooms may find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place, grappling with a question that Trump\u2019s presidency has posed in many different ways: How should the legal system respond to a norm-shattering president? On the one hand, they\u2019re in a position of significant power, with the ability to question what Trump is doing and why. But their responses to Trump could also change the fragile balance of power between the courts and the president in ways that are very difficult to predict.\n\nOther cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nRoger Stone, a Republican strategist and longtime adviser to Trump, was indicted last month by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team; Stone is accused of a variety of crimes related to his alleged attempt to cover up communications with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign. Stone pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include witness tampering, making false statements and obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nA judge postponed the sentencing of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in a Virginia court, where he was convicted last year on eight financial and banking fraud charges, because of an ongoing conflict over whether he breached his plea agreement in a separate case by lying to Mueller. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., scheduled a closed hearing on the plea agreement today.\n\nA lawsuit filed last year accusing Trump, his three eldest children and his company of using the Trump brand to entice vulnerable people into a fraudulent business deal was updated to include new allegations, including a claim that the Trumps profited from a marketing scheme aimed at teenagers.\n\nThe Trump administration", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-judges-pay-attention-to-trumps-tweets/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Why One of Trump\u2019s Biggest Legal Threats Is New York\u2019s Attorney General", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nAfter two years of legal wrangling, the Trump Foundation will soon be no more. Last month, in the midst of a dramatic month for cases that stem from President Trump\u2019s pre-presidency life, a judge signed off on a plan to shutter Trump\u2019s much-criticized personal foundation. Under the new agreement, the foundation will be dissolved under court supervision.\n\nIn effect, the deal implies that the foundation cannot be trusted to disburse its remaining $1.7 million to legitimate nonprofits. But even though the foundation is dissolving, the lawsuit against the foundation will continue, with the New York attorney general seeking damages for the foundation\u2019s alleged \u201cextensive and persistent violations of state and federal law,\u201d including the illegal use of foundation money to pay off legal settlements, buy portraits of Trump, and promote Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nThe December settlement is an important reminder of the risk that the state of New York poses for Trump. In particular, New York is uniquely well-positioned to go after Trump where it could hurt him most \u2014 through his businesses. In fact, New York has been one of the most significant and I\u2019d argue most underrated legal hazards for Trump since he began his campaign for president. Here are three reasons why.\n\nNew York has jurisdiction over Trump\u2019s family businesses\n\nPursuing legal challenges against Trump has become something of a sport among Democratic attorneys general over the past two years, but most of these fights focus on actions taken by Trump\u2019s administration rather than matters that implicate him personally. But because Trump\u2019s businesses and his presidential campaign are registered in New York, state officials have the authority to investigate and potentially prosecute him for violations of state law.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys have argued in a separate case that involves a former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant who\u2019s suing Trump for defamation in New York that as president, he should be immune to lawsuits in state courts. It\u2019s an open constitutional question, but two judges have already come down against Trump, saying that when unofficial conduct is involved, there\u2019s no reason to exempt the president from state lawsuits. The case is still being appealed, but even if it\u2019s decided in Trump\u2019s favor, legal actions could still be brought against his businesses or children.\n\nWorse still for Trump, state prosecutions are pardon-proof, since the president\u2019s power to grant clemency extends only to federal crimes. This means that while Trump could pardon an associate or family member implicated in, for example, the Mueller investigation (or even try to pardon himself), his get-out-of-jail-free card won\u2019t work in New York. There\u2019s even been a push to amend New York\u2019s double jeopardy laws to make it possible for someone convicted (and, hypothetically, pardoned) under federal law to be prosecuted for corresponding violations of state law.\n\nState prosecutors are especially tough on financial misconduct\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the offenses where Trump has the greatest potential liability in New York \u2014 for example, tax or other kinds of corporate fraud \u2014 are ones the New York attorney general\u2019s office is particularly adept at handling. Over the past 15 years, New York has steadily stepped up its prosecutions of financial crimes. \u201cFraud cases are the linchpin of what most attorneys general do, and the laws are particularly strong in New York,\u201d said Paul Nolette, a political science professor at Marquette University who studies state attorneys general.\n\nTrump knows this firsthand, because of a previous tangle with former attorney general Eric Schneiderman. The state sued Trump University for defrauding customers in a case that was settled for $25 million. And because Trump ran for office, opening his businesses to a whole new level of national scrutiny, the Trump Foundation lawsuit may have only been the beginning. Before he resigned last year, Schneiderman was reportedly cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller on matters related to Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and state tax officials said they\u2019re looking into potential massive tax fraud by the Trump family after reporting from The New York Times last fall. Meanwhile, New York\u2019s new attorney general, Letitia James campaigned on a promise to hold the president accountable across a wide range of issues, including his businesses and finances.\n\n\u201cThe Mueller investigation is the shiny object everyone is watching,\u201d Berit Berger, a former federal prosecutor and the executive director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity, told me. \u201cBut under everyone\u2019s nose are what look like much more straightforward violations of state law, including some pretty flagrant tax fraud. Depending on what happens with Mueller, that could be what actually sinks the big ship.\u201d\n\nNew York prosecutors may have the clearest shot at indicting Trump while he\u2019s president\n\nFinally, legal experts told me that if New York officials have sufficient evidence against Trump and the appetite for a protracted legal battle, they may have the best chance at testing a high-stakes constitutional unknown: Is it possible to issue a criminal indictment against a sitting president?\n\nUnlike their federal counterparts, state prosecutors are not bound by a Department of Justice policy that says that a sitting president is immune from indictment (a former president is fair game). \u201cI think it would be hard for a judge to tell New York that it can\u2019t pursue charges for criminal violations of its own state law by Donald Trump that occurred before he was president,\u201d said Andy Wright, former associate counsel to President Obama.\n\nNot everyone I spoke with agreed with this view, however. Andrew Coan, a law professor at the University of Arizona and the author of a new book about special prosecutors, said there might even be a stronger argument against allowing state attorneys general to indict a president. \u201cThe attorney general of New York only speaks for her state\u2019s voters, not the country as a whole,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it seems strange to let that person do something that would significantly impair the president\u2019s ability to serve.\u201d\n\nBut even without an indictment \u2014 which would unleash an epic constitutional showdown \u2014 New York could still threaten Trump\u2019s business empire through civil suits or prosecutions of his family members and inflict a significant amount of political damage on the president in the process.\n\nNone of this, of course, answers one key question: If New York is such a danger to Trump, why haven\u2019t prosecutors or the attorney general filed charges or a lawsuit against the president or his businesses?\n\nThe Trump Foundation case is actually a good example of why one shouldn\u2019t read too much into the state\u2019s relative inaction. Reports that the foundation was being used for Trump\u2019s personal benefit began while he was still running for office, but the lawsuit wasn\u2019t filed until 18 months after Trump took office. (There is currently one other case in New York involving Trump \u2014 the lawsuit from the former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant \u2014 that we\u2019re tracking as part of the Trump Docket.) But New York officials could be waiting until after Mueller\u2019s probe is concluded to take further legal action \u2014 or they might be investigating other instances of potential corporate fraud that we aren\u2019t yet aware of.\n\nOther cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nAttorneys for Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chair who was recently accused of violating his plea agreement with special counsel Robert Mueller, failed to fully redact sensitive details from a recent legal filing in the case. As a result, we learned that Manafort was accused of sharing presidential campaign data with a business associate who has links to Russian intelligence, and that during the campaign he discussed a plan for peace in Ukraine \u2014 which Russia and its allies were advocating as a path to lifting Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia. On Tuesday, a subsequent, correctly redacted filing from Mueller spelled out a few more details, including a confirmation that Konstantin Kilimnik, a former Manafort aide with alleged ties to Russian intelligence, is still a focus of the investigation.\n\nSentencing may be postponed for Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide and business partner of Manafort, who has been cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigation. Prosecutors requested a two-month delay in his sentencing because Gates is still assisting with \u201cseveral ongoing investigations.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\n\nAlthough the case is paused until the partial government shutdown ends, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments in the District of Columbia and Maryland\u2019s emoluments lawsuit against Trump for the court\u2019s March 19-21 session.\n\nThe Trump administration", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-one-of-trumps-biggest-legal-threats-is-new-yorks-attorney-general/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Will The Supreme Court Fast-Track Cases Involving Trump?", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nIf the Supreme Court justices have been trying to signal that they want a quiet term \u2014 perhaps some time to recover after Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s hyper-partisan confirmation hearings last fall, which may have shaken public faith in the court as an impartial institution \u2014 the Trump administration hasn\u2019t gotten the hint.\n\nOver the past few months, the solicitor general\u2019s office has blanketed the court with requests to bypass the normal legal process and rule swiftly in high-profile cases. Even after the court rebuffed attempts to halt the first Census trial and a climate-change lawsuit, the Trump administration kept trying, asking the justices to cancel an injunction against Trump\u2019s asylum ban. In an even more unusual move, the White House also asked the court to leapfrog lower courts and intervene in cases involving Trump\u2019s decision to revoke the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the administration\u2019s policy against transgender military servicemembers.\n\nThe justices rejected the Trump administration\u2019s request to block the injunction against the asylum ban in December, but only by a narrow 5-4 margin and several other requests are still pending. How the court responds will tell us a lot about what Trump might be able to expect from the court\u2019s newly minted conservative majority.\n\nThe high court does have the power to short-circuit the appeals process, but requests to do so are rare \u2014 and it typically happens only in extreme situations, such as when President Richard Nixon refused to turn over tapes of conversations recorded in the White House during the Watergate investigation. But the Trump administration appears to be betting that, given enough pressure, the court\u2019s conservative majority will step in to save signature parts of the president\u2019s agenda. At the same time, these tactics could put justices like John Roberts \u2014 who is known for his concern about the court\u2019s reputation \u2014 in a pickle, if they want to avoid the perception that the court is simply bending to Trump\u2019s will.\n\n\u201cTaking these cases would suggest that the court is willing to treat the Trump administration as if the normal rules don\u2019t apply to it,\u201d Joshua Matz, a constitutional lawyer and publisher of the Take Care blog, which covers Trump-related legal issues, said. \u201cAnd it would also have the effect of essentially putting the legality of the Trump administration\u2019s entire domestic agenda on the Supreme Court\u2019s docket this year.\u201d\n\nAt least one case involving the administration is already on the court\u2019s schedule. In November, the justices agreed to rule on whether Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and other high-ranking officials could be required to testify about their reasons for adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 Census. Those oral arguments are slated for February. Why the court agreed to hear this part of the case is still a bit of a mystery, since Ross never testified and the justices didn\u2019t halt the trial, which means the lower court judge might, in the meantime, issue a ruling that has nothing to do with the administration\u2019s rationale for adding the question \u2014 potentially making the dispute over whether they can be compelled to testify irrelevant. (Meanwhile, the trial in a separate lawsuit over the citizenship question is scheduled to begin on January 7, despite the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to slow it down, and another set of cases related to the question seem likely to go to trial later this month.) But the court\u2019s decision to take the case shows, at the very least, that the justices aren\u2019t unwilling to entertain out-of-the-ordinary requests from Trump. And that might explain why Trump administration lawyers are deluging the court with petitions, hoping that at least a few more will rise to the top.\n\nIn some of those cases, though, the Trump administration has a tall order \u2014 they have to convince the justices not just that the issues in the case are important, but that there\u2019s a genuine need to rule on them early, before other courts have had their say. This was less of an issue for the Census case; since forms for the 2020 Census are due to be printed in June, the court had to act quickly. But the Trump administration is arguing that several other cases are pressing enough to make the cut for this year\u2019s docket too, rather than waiting until the next term, which doesn\u2019t start until October. That\u2019s in part because \u2014 according to the administration \u2014 lower court judges have been too aggressive in blocking Trump\u2019s policies from going into effect while they\u2019re being challenged.\n\nIf the administration succeeds in convincing the court, the ongoing litigation over DACA could end up on the justices\u2019 agenda. They\u2019re helped by the fact that one appeals court has already ruled that Trump couldn\u2019t immediately revoke deportation protections. But the lower courts still haven\u2019t ruled on the substance of Trump\u2019s DACA decision \u2014 they have simply said the people challenging it have enough of a chance at success that the program shouldn\u2019t be revoked in the meantime. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell Law School and immigration law expert, said it would be somewhat unusual for the high court to intervene at this stage. He added that the DACA case lacks the \u201cimmediacy\u201d of the travel ban case, where thousands of people were being prevented from entering the country, so there\u2019s not the same sense of urgency for the Supreme Court to act. But Matz and other legal experts told me that the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling could still provide enough of a reason for the Supreme Court to take up the issue this term.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s recent plea for the Supreme Court to hear the transgender military ban cases \u2014 or, barring that, to at least allow the ban to go into effect \u2014 seems likelier to prompt a response of \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry?\u201d Several district court judges have blocked the administration from implementing the latest version of the policy, but an appeals court has yet to rule on whether those injunctions are valid. The plaintiffs are arguing that it\u2019s not as urgent as the government\u2019s lawyers claim, since they have already missed several opportunities to expedite it. \u201cWe\u2019re still very early in the process,\u201d said Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. \u201cAnd there just isn\u2019t much evidence that this is a dire emergency.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s disregard for protocol could also backfire, if the justices decide that they simply don\u2019t want to be rushed. The justices\u2019 decision to reject Trump\u2019s request to lift the injunction against the asylum ban could be a sign that they\u2019re growing impatient with the administration\u2019s tactics. Whatever happens, their responses to the Trump administration this month will be an important indicator of how the court\u2019s conservative wing \u2014 and in particular, Chief Justice Roberts \u2014 sees their relationship with the president.\n\nOther Cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nMichael Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer and \u201cfixer,\u201d was sentenced to three years in prison for financial crimes, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress. He was also told to pay nearly $2 million in financial penalties. The judge lowered his sentence from a maximum of more than five years because of his cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nSentencing for former national security advisor Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI last year, was postponed until Flynn has completed his own cooperation agreement with Mueller.\n\nActress Stormy Daniels was ordered to pay nearly $300,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees to Trump, after a judge dismissed a defamation lawsuit she and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, filed against Trump last year. Avenatti has indicated that he\u2019ll appeal the ruling.\n\nThe Trump Foundation agreed to dissolve under court supervision, amid a broader legal dispute about whether the foundation was used to make illegal payments to the Trump campaign. The rest of the lawsuit, which was filed by the New York attorney general last summer, will continue to move forward.\n\nA judge ruled that a group of plaintiffs who are suing the Trump family for allegedly using their brand to lure vulnerable investors into making sham investments can remain anonymous. Allowing plaintiffs to use pseudonyms is unusual, but the judge wrote that their fear of retaliation from the president or his followers is \u201creal\u201d and \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump\n\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to hear a case involving Trump\u2019s alleged violation of the Constitution\u2019s foreign and domestic emoluments clause, which prohibits federal officials from receiving gifts from foreign governments. A lower court judge had recently issued a set of rulings allowing the plaintiffs in the case, the District of Columbia and Maryland, to subpoena Trump businesses. But Trump\u2019s lawyers are arguing that producing these documents would be a \u201cdistraction to the President\u2019s performance of his constitutional duties.\u201d This means that the lower court proceedings are frozen until the appeals court rules. The appeal has also been temporarily halted by the court, however, after Trump\u2019s attorneys told the court that the government shutdown was preventing them from being able to do their work.\n\nThe Trump Administration", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-the-supreme-court-fast-track-cases-involving-trump/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Why It Might Be Impossible To Overturn A Presidential Pardon", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nIf the American president has a superpower, it might be the ability to grant pardons. With the stroke of a pen, the president can wipe away the consequences of a federal criminal conviction, without having to ask permission from Congress or prepare for a battle in the courts. In the past, presidents have used this power in a variety of sweeping and controversial ways, perhaps most famously when Gerald Ford pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, for any crimes he might have committed while in office.\n\nBut President Trump has an undeniably expansive and unusual view of the pardon power. He has declared that he has the ability to pardon himself, but that question is far from settled, in part because no other president has tried to do it. And his recent refusal to rule out a pardon for his former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, who tanked a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller, has prompted speculation about whether Trump is considering pardoning Manafort or other subjects of the Russia investigation.\n\nOf course, Trump has yet to pardon Manafort (or himself). But an ongoing case involving Trump\u2019s pardon of Joe Arpaio, the controversial former Arizona sheriff (we\u2019ve added the case to our Trump Docket data in the latest update), does raise important questions about limits on a president\u2019s ability to grant pardons. This case offers a sneak peek into the kinds of arguments that could be made if Trump issues a pardon to someone like Manafort. But it also shows why, as long as he doesn\u2019t pardon himself, asking the courts to overrule Trump\u2019s pardons may be a stretch, since the pardon was arguably designed to be a boundless power, with only Congress and the voters as a check on its abuse. \u201cThis authority is pretty explicitly given to the president away from the courts,\u201d Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, Austin, told me. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be worth all that much if the courts had the power on a case-by-case basis to adjudicate whether individual pardons were invalid.\u201d\n\nYou may recall that in August 2017, Trump announced that he was pardoning Arpaio, who was known for his hardline immigration enforcement tactics as sheriff. At the time, Arpaio had been convicted of contempt of court after he refused to comply with a federal court\u2019s order to stop racially profiling Latinos during patrols. The pardon was disturbing to many legal experts, who were concerned it had stripped the court of the only mechanism by which it can enforce its decisions, leaving it unable to fulfill its constitutional obligations to people whose rights were violated.\n\nIf Arpaio had simply accepted his pardon and moved on, the story might have ended there. But he took the unusual step of petitioning the judge in his case, Susan Bolton, to vacate his conviction. People who have been pardoned don\u2019t typically try to have their criminal records erased \u2014 the pardon absolves them of all the consequences of a crime but doesn\u2019t change the fact that there was a conviction \u2014 but Arpaio argued that since he hadn\u2019t yet been sentenced, the conviction should also be wiped from his record. Several advocates and law professors saw an opening and filed amicus briefs asking Bolton to cancel Arpaio\u2019s pardon on the grounds that a pardon can\u2019t be used to absolve officials who infringe on others\u2019 constitutional rights. \u201cA president couldn\u2019t pardon all white people for a specific crime but not people of color, because that would violate the Equal Protection Clause,\u201d said Aditi Juneja, a spokesperson for Protect Democracy, one of the advocacy groups challenging Arpaio\u2019s pardon. \u201cSimilarly, the pardon power is constrained by other parts of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn her ruling last fall, Bolton said the pardon was valid and refused to further engage with the question of whether the pardon should be overruled. That said, she did also refuse to vacate Arpaio\u2019s conviction, saying that the pardon removes punishment, but doesn\u2019t, in the words of a previous ruling, \u201cblot out guilt.\u201d Arpaio appealed her decision, and the case is now pending in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (the president\u2019s least favorite circuit court), where a new set of judges will soon decide whether to take the question of the constitutionality of Arpaio\u2019s pardon more seriously.\n\nPardons are criticized but rarely questioned\n\nPerhaps even more than other constitutional provisions, the pardon was built on the hope that presidents would have the good sense not to abuse it. During their debates over the pardon power, the founders actually considered an exception that would stop a treasonous president from absolving co-conspirators who had also committed treason, but they ultimately decided against adopting it. The Constitution does outline a few limits to the pardon power \u2014 it only applies to crimes (not lawsuits), it can only be used to forgive federal (rather than state) offenses, and it can\u2019t be used in cases of impeachment \u2014 and the courts have, over time, sketched out a few more boundaries.\n\n\u201cThere is a check on a president who abuses the pardon power,\u201d Brian Kalt, a law professor at Michigan State University and an expert on pardons, told me. \u201cHe gets voted out of office or he is impeached.\u201d Although a president hasn\u2019t yet been impeached for an unpopular pardon, Ford\u2019s popularity did suffer after he pardoned Nixon, and that may have cost him the 1976 election. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton also granted risky pardons \u2014 Bush functionally ended the Iran-Contra investigation, in which he was implicated, by pardoning six former Reagan administration officials, and Clinton pardoned his half-brother. But both Bush and Clinton granted these pardons in the waning days of their presidencies, when the political consequences weren\u2019t as severe.\n\nBut generally, even though past pardons have been criticized and even investigated, the legitimacy of a president\u2019s pardon hasn\u2019t been questioned in the way that Trump\u2019s pardon of Arpaio is being debated. Trump\u2019s actions and rhetoric have, however, exposed a loophole in the pardon power: Even if a pardon is arguably an abuse of presidential power, there\u2019s currently no clear way to undo the pardon itself. So now the question before the courts is whether Trump\u2019s actions are extreme enough to warrant blowing up the constitutional status quo. Advocates of pardon restrictions say that their arguments really aren\u2019t that radical \u2014 they just think pardons shouldn\u2019t override the rest of the constitutional system. What remains to be seen is whether the courts feel the same way \u2014 or whether they\u2019ll tell Trump\u2019s critics to take their grievances to Congress.\n\nOther cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nLast week was big for special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation and closely related cases, particularly for three cases we\u2019re tracking: United States v. Manafort, United States v. Cohen, United States v. Flynn.\n\nLate Friday, Mueller\u2019s team released a memo arguing that Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chair, told \u201cmultiple discernable lies\u201d to investigators in violation of his plea agreement. Much of the memo was redacted, but some of the alleged lies were related to Manafort\u2019s contacts with the Trump administration and with a former Manafort aide who has ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nProsecutors in the Southern District of New York and Mueller\u2019s team also released two separate sentencing memos for Michael Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer. In the Southern District of New York\u2019s memo, prosecutors alleged that Trump, while he was a candidate for president, directed Cohen to make illegal payments to two women to keep them from airing details about past affairs.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mueller\u2019s team filed a sentencing memo in the case of Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security advisor who last year pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. According to the memo, Flynn gave \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to Mueller\u2019s probe, but heavy redactions made it impossible to learn much more than that.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nOne of the three cases that challenge Trump\u2019s alleged \u201cemoluments\u201d \u2014 that is, illegal gifts from foreign and state governments that critics claim he receives in the form of profits through his businesses \u2014 is speeding ahead, at least in legal time. Last week, Judge Peter J. Messitte released a schedule for discovery in the case, District of Columbia v. Trump, which is set to conclude next summer. The plaintiffs have said they\u2019ll subpoena evidence from as many as 13 private entities connected to Trump, including the Trump Organization. But the process could be derailed: Justice Department lawyers and private lawyers representing Trump have vowed to fight the order with an unusual appeal to the 4th Circuit, asking the higher judges to declare Messitte\u2019s discovery order to be illegal or improper.\n\nThe Trump Administration", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-it-might-be-impossible-to-overturn-a-presidential-pardon/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "What Trump\u2019s Legal Battles Tell Us About Presidential Power", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nWhile he loudly calls the media\u2019s attention to issues like immigration and trade agreements, President Trump is quietly testing the limits of his authority through the courts. His views of executive power and separation of powers are, in dozens of different cases, forcing the legal system to answer knotty \u2014 and sometimes unprecedented \u2014 questions about what the U.S. president is really allowed to do.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon, of course, for presidents to push at the boundaries of the presidency and for the courts to rein them in. But Trump stands out for both the range and breadth of the constitutional questions that have been raised during his presidency, which isn\u2019t yet 2 years old \u2014 from his attorney\u2019s claim that a president can never obstruct justice to his declaring that he has the right to pardon himself. To be clear, neither of those legal questions is being considered by courts at the moment (although if Trump tries to pardon himself, I can promise that will go before a judge in record time), but there are plenty of other consequential cases currently working their way through the judicial system. Disputes about the scope of presidential authority are never easy for judges to resolve, but Trump\u2019s unorthodox statements and actions are making it even more difficult for the courts to determine when, and how, to place limits on the president.\n\nWhether the courts reject Trump\u2019s actions or allow them, the results of these cases will leave their mark on our country long after this administration is over, because they\u2019ll be enshrined in law. So far, the nation\u2019s highest court has upheld a policy restricting travel to the U.S. by people from several nations, some of which are majority-Muslim \u2014 still one of Trump\u2019s most controversial actions. Others seem likely to end up at the Supreme Court; indeed, one aspect of the legal fight over the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census will go before the court in February. Although many lower courts have been skeptical of the legality of some of Trump\u2019s actions, Trump and the Republican Senate are remaking the federal judiciary through a record-setting series of conservative judicial appointments, which could have implications for how similar cases are received in the future.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re launching The Trump Docket, a column that will explore some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape the contours of presidential power for years to come.\n\nTo do this, I\u2019ve assembled an initial set of cases to track and investigate and divided them into three categories (Pre-presidency Trump, President Trump and the Trump administration) based on the nature of their connection to the president. The list is far from exhaustive, and the choices I\u2019ve made are admittedly subjective, although I\u2019ve consulted more than a dozen legal experts and political scientists along the way. I\u2019ll add and subtract cases as they arise or are resolved, but my aim overall is to isolate a group of legal challenges that illuminate the range of Trump-related issues that are currently in the courts. And every week or two, I\u2019ll dive into what a particular case or set of cases means \u2014 for Trump personally, his presidency and our democracy. For today\u2019s column, I\u2019m going to walk through some of the major cases in each category and outline their stakes.\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nTrump was elected with several dozen active lawsuits against him, so it\u2019s not surprising that he\u2019s still battling cases that involve conduct from before he was president. But several are now forcing courts to grapple with how our justice system should treat a president who is being sued. And the ongoing special counsel investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election has raised the specter of whether the chief executive can be criminally indicted. In this category, I\u2019ll follow cases involving conduct from Trump\u2019s pre-presidency days (even if the lawsuit or charges were filed after Trump became president), including:\n\nA lawsuit filed by former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Summer Zervos, who is accusing Trump of defamation for calling her a liar after she said he had sexually harassed her.\n\nAdult film actress Stormy Daniels\u2019s dispute with Trump over a hush-money deal she signed during the 2016 election campaign.\n\nNew York state\u2019s lawsuit against the Trump Foundation \u2014 which Trump announced after the 2016 election that he would dissolve, saying that he wanted to avoid conflicts of interest \u2014 that argues the Trump family\u2019s charitable organization repeatedly violated both state and federal laws.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nTrump\u2019s unwillingness to divest from his businesses after he became president and his aggressive Twitter presence haven\u2019t just raised eyebrows \u2014 they quickly spurred legal action. In this category, I\u2019ll be looking at cases related to Trump\u2019s conduct as president that have raised questions about limits on a president\u2019s personal behavior and how much power the courts have to rein him in. These cases include:\n\nThree separate lawsuits that claim Trump\u2019s business ties are in violation of anti-corruption clauses in the Constitution that prohibit federal officials from receiving domestic and foreign \u201cemoluments,\u201d or financial benefits, without congressional approval. Cases have been brought by Democrats in Congress, a watchdog group and concerned private citizens, and the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington, D.C.\n\nA case brought by people who have been blocked by Trump on Twitter and claim that the president is violating their First Amendment rights.\n\nA lawsuit from a professional writers organization that claims Trump is using his office to punish members of the media whom he dislikes and is asking the courts to stop him.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nThis category is both the biggest and the trickiest to define. That\u2019s because every administration is constantly engaged in court battles over the way they\u2019re interpreting laws and regulations, but those fights don\u2019t often revolve around constitutional issues. We also wanted to focus on the policies that press at the boundaries of the president\u2019s power, relative to the other branches of government \u2014 as well as disputes that we might not expect to see in another administration. These cases include:\n\nThe multiple, ongoing legal battles over whether the executive branch can withhold funding from so-called sanctuary cities, which are places that have instituted policies limiting local cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\n\nA challenge from a lobbying group that represents steel traders, who claim that Trump overstepped his constitutional bounds by imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nLawsuits attacking the Trump administration\u2019s revocation of \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d \u2014 a designation that shields migrants from deportation if they\u2019re from certain countries experiencing natural disasters or conflict \u2014 for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan; they say that the president was motivated by racially discriminatory views against people from these countries.\n\nThe fight over whether the Trump administration\u2019s plan to exclude transgender people from the military is constitutional.\n\nYou can see \u2014 and follow \u2014 the full set of cases here. I\u2019ll periodically update the data set with the latest on each case, and I\u2019ll post new and interesting information on Twitter. And don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you think an important case is missing or if there\u2019s an interesting angle on one of these cases you\u2019d like us to explore. We want this column to answer your questions about how Trump is changing the presidency, so please be in touch.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 26, 2018, 5:10 p.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that the Trump Foundation had been dissolved.

They Just Completely Disagree On What It Says.", "text": "Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nPoll(s) of the week:\n\nIt has been a little over two weeks since special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election was released, and so far the majority of Americans seem to think the report was both fair and accurate. But, as we\u2019ll see, there is still deep disagreement about what Mueller\u2019s findings actually show.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted in the week following the report\u2019s release, 51 percent of Americans felt that the report was fair and even-handed while only 21 percent felt that it was not. What\u2019s more, both Democrats and Republicans were equally likely to say the report was fair \u2014 53 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of Republicans said so. And a YouGov/Huffpost poll that was conducted right after the report was released found that just over 70 percent of both Democrats and Republicans thought the report was accurate \u2014 in each case, about 40 percent thought it was \u201cvery\u201d accurate and about 30 percent thought it was \u201csomewhat\u201d accurate.\n\nThis may be related to an uptick in the number of Republicans who said they had favorable views of Mueller after March 24, when Attorney General William Barr released a four-page summary of Mueller\u2019s findings. Pollsters like AP-NORC and Marist have found sharp upticks in the number of Republicans who said they thought the investigation was fair after the summary was released. And as you can see in the chart below, Republicans are now more likely to view Mueller\u2019s work favorably \u2014 his job approval ratings are now almost equally high among members of either party, though as Republican opinion has gone up, some polls found Democratic opinion dropped slightly.\n\nMuch of this change in opinion happened right after Barr\u2019s summary was released \u2014 so far, making the full report public does not seem to have shifted opinions about the investigation nearly as much as the summary did.\n\nMoreover, while both Democrats and Republicans generally believe the report was accurate and fair, they don\u2019t seem to agree on its contents, and their perceptions of whether Trump obstructed justice remain largely unchanged. The majority of Republicans believe that Trump did not obstruct justice, while the majority of Democrats believe that he did, according to a series of Washington Post polls, including the most recent one, one conducted after Barr\u2019s summary was released, and one conducted while Mueller\u2019s investigation was still ongoing. Democrats and Republicans also don\u2019t agree on whether the report exonerates Trump. According to the most recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, 61 percent of Republicans and only 6 percent of Democrats think the Mueller report cleared Trump of all wrongdoing.\n\nOpinions on obstruction haven\u2019t changed much Responses by party to a question asking whether Americans believe Trump interfered with the Mueller investigation in a way that amounted to obstruction of justice Democrats Republicans yes no yes no August 2018 80% 10% 19% 71% March 2019 80 16 21 77 April 2019 81 10 13 77 Source: Washington Post/ABC and Washington Post/Schar School Polls\n\nPartisans also disagree about what Congress should do now. When asked to choose between four possible next steps, a recent Marist poll found that only 27 percent of Democrats wanted to start impeachment proceedings while 56 percent preferred that Congress continue to investigate potential wrongdoing. The other two options were unpopular with Democrats: 6 percent said Congress should publicly reprimand the president, and 7 percent said that it should take no action. By contrast, 82 percent of Republicans in the poll wanted Congress to take no further action. And that April Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 56 percent of Americans think Congress should not begin impeachment proceedings, which is a 10-point jump from last August. A CNN poll conducted last week also found that a majority of Americans in both parties think Congress should look into why the Justice Department started the inquiry that led to Mueller\u2019s investigation, an action Trump has called for.\n\nAmericans \u2014 and especially Republicans \u2014 seemed to gain faith in Mueller once the investigation ended and Barr\u2019s summary was released, but public opinion does not seem to have changed much since the full report was released. There are still deep partisan divisions about what exactly the report revealed, what it means for the president, and what the path forward should be.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\nAG Bill Barr: Mueller\u2019s letter criticizing his summary of report \u2018a bit snitty\u2019\n\nOther polling bites\n\nTrump approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 41.8 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.1 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -11.3 points). At this time last week, 41.5 percent approved and 53.1 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -11.6 points).

The Lady Techsters had already compiled a 109-9 record over the previous three seasons, winning the 1981 AIAW Championship (the precursor to the women\u2019s tourney) with a perfect 34-0 record. Led by Wade Trophy winner Pam Kelly, the team put the finishing touches on another title in 1982 by defeating Cheyney and legendary coach C. Vivian Stringer in the final. It was the first of two NCAA championships Louisiana Tech would win in the 1980s and started a run of seven No. 1 seeds across nine NCAA tournaments.\n\nLouisiana Tech was the UConn of the women\u2019s NCAA tourney\u2019s early era. But aside from a few more strong seasons in the 1990s, it\u2019s been downhill since. The Lady Techsters haven\u2019t made the NCAA field since 2011 \u2014 at 14-14 this season, they aren\u2019t likely to end that drought soon \u2014 and they haven\u2019t had an All-American since Tamicha Jackson in 2000.\n\nLouisiana Tech isn\u2019t alone among once-great programs whose talent pipelines have dried up. A number of teams that were the titans of the early NCAA tournament have struggled in recent decades. And in their place, a new ruling class of schools has emerged to become the defining programs of the modern age. In a championship as young as the women\u2019s tournament, it\u2019s been fascinating to watch the rise and fall of programs that, not very long ago, were in a very different place.\n\nTo visualize the progress of women\u2019s programs in the absence of game-level data, such as our Elo ratings, we can use NCAA Tournament seeds as a proxy for team strength over time. This doesn\u2019t explicitly factor in how a team performs in the tournament itself, but it does measure the general quality of a team\u2019s entire season \u2014 plus, higher seeds tend to win more in the tournament anyway . To measure this, we awarded \u201cseed points\u201d in proportion to a given seed number\u2019s expected wins in the tournament, calibrated to a 100-point scale where the No. 1 seed gets 100 points, No. 2 gets 70 points, and so forth.\n\nA more basic scoring system might assign 16 points to a No. 1 seed, 15 to a No. 2, etc., all the way down to 1 point for a 16 seed. But that would understate the power of a high seed: Instead of being only twice as valuable as, say, a 9 seed, a No. 1 seed wins about seven times as many games during the average tournament.\n\nAveraging those seed-based point totals over all the women\u2019s tournaments held since 1982, here are the top overall programs of the entire NCAA tourney era.\n\nWhich women\u2019s programs have been most successful during the NCAA tournament era? Seed points* in NCAA tournaments held for women\u2019s programs, by decade and overall since 1982 Seed Points Per Tournament, by decade School 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s Overall 1 Tennessee 73.7 95.4 87.4 68.9 82.1 2 UConn 2.2 72.0 89.4 100.0 68.4 3 Stanford 15.7 83.3 51.1 77.4 58.5 4 Duke 2.7 23.3 89.4 55.3 44.5 5 Georgia 65.0 45.7 42.9 24.6 44.0 6 Louisiana Tech 92.6 60.1 27.1 1.5 44.0 7 Texas 76.4 29.8 35.0 35.1 42.6 8 Maryland 43.5 20.8 38.6 50.4 37.7 9 North Carolina 25.4 38.3 62.5 20.2 37.7 10 Notre Dame 0.0 10.9 35.9 93.4 35.4 11 Penn St. 31.0 48.7 32.3 19.6 33.4 12 Ohio St. 46.1 15.5 36.2 33.8 32.1 13 Purdue 4.2 50.1 47.4 17.5 31.5 14 Baylor 0.0 0.0 41.1 83.7 31.5 15 Virginia 40.8 58.4 19.3 4.9 31.0 16 Vanderbilt 11.1 46.9 48.5 10.5 30.8 17 LSU 25.2 16.8 60.0 17.4 30.5 18 Old Dominion 57.2 42.5 17.1 0.0 28.5 19 Iowa 30.1 43.1 11.2 20.0 26.0 20 NC State 41.3 26.6 19.5 12.9 24.6 *Seed points award a score on a 100-point scale; a No. 1 seed gets 100 points, while the rest descend in proportion to the seed\u2019s expected wins during the tournament. Source: NCAA\n\nSome teams, such as Tennessee, have been relatively consistent throughout the NCAA era. Although the Lady Vols were at their best under coach Pat Summitt during the 1990s, ranking first among all programs in seed points per tournament, they were also the third-best program of the 2000s according to our metric, fourth-best of the 1980s and even fifth-best of the 2010s, though the past few years haven\u2019t been as strong by Tennessee standards. (The Vols probably won\u2019t be adding to their tally this season, either: Tennessee is currently 18-11 and ranks 63rd in the RPI ratings, making it a bubble team at best for this year\u2019s bracket.)\n\nMaryland and North Carolina have also been relatively good throughout the history of the women\u2019s tournament. But more striking on the list above is how many programs followed the Louisiana Tech path \u2014 dominating the early days of the tourney, only to drop off the face of the Earth later. In addition to the Lady Techsters, three other programs \u2014 Long Beach State, Southern Cal and Old Dominion \u2014 have seen the biggest drop-off in seed points per tournament between the tournament\u2019s first two decades and its two most recent.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, we have the programs that started slow and picked up steam into the present day. And as hard as it is to believe now, Connecticut wasn\u2019t always the unstoppable force we see today. The Huskies didn\u2019t make their first NCAA tournament appearance until 1989 and didn\u2019t win a championship before 1995. Now it\u2019s shocking news when UConn might not be a No. 1 seed, and it\u2019s currently riding a streak of 11 straight Final Four berths. According to our metric, no team\u2019s fortunes have improved more between the NCAA tourney\u2019s early period in the 1980s and the current era than the Huskies\u2019.\n\nOther stunning out-of-nowhere success stories include current No. 1 Baylor, which made its first NCAA tournament in 2001(!); defending champion Notre Dame, which didn\u2019t win an NCAA tournament game until 1996; and Duke, which \u2014 despite the success of its men\u2019s team \u2014 failed to make much noise on the women\u2019s side until the late 1990s/early 2000s. With the exception of the Blue Devils (who at 14-14 are unlikely to make the tournament), all of these programs have continued to be great this season. In fact, many more of today\u2019s top teams \u2014 such as Louisville, Mississippi State and South Carolina \u2014 all emerged from humble results during the 1980s and \u201890s.\n\nMost sports see early champions maintain some sort of strong presence into modern times, like the New York Yankees in baseball and Boston Celtics in basketball. So it\u2019s surprising that this many of the most dominant teams of the early women\u2019s tourney have vanished from the competitive landscape. It\u2019s not impossible to imagine Louisiana Tech returning to its former glory someday, but for now the Lady Techsters\u2019 success is a memory fading quickly into ancient history.\n\nSara Ziegler contributed research.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/louisiana-tech-was-the-uconn-of-the-80s/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "Two Years In, Turnover In Trump\u2019s Cabinet Is Still Historically High", "text": "It took less than a year into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency for members of his Cabinet to start leaving their jobs: In 2017, chief of staff Reince Priebus and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price called it quits, while Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly left his post to succeed Priebus.

Most recently, only a couple of days into 2019, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke followed them out the door.\n\nAbout halfway through President Trump\u2019s term seems like a good time to check in once again on the rate of turnover in his Cabinet compared with past presidents. Once again, it is unprecedented in recent history. Through this point in their presidencies, none of the preceding six presidents had weathered more turnover in the 24 offices that constitute Trump\u2019s Cabinet than Trump has. As of Jan. 8, there had already been 12 staffing changes to his Cabinet. The president with the next-highest number at this point in his presidency was Bill Clinton, with only six. In fact, by Jan. 8 of the third year of the previous six administrations combined, just 16 people had left these offices.\n\nTypically, people don\u2019t start departing en masse until a president\u2019s second term. All four of the two-term presidents we looked at \u2014 Ronald Reagan, Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u2014 didn\u2019t reach 12 personnel changes until after they were re-elected. And it still took the one-term presidents, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush, four years in office to pass the 12-departure mark.\n\nIn the chart above, we\u2019ve tallied how many people departed from one of the offices in Trump\u2019s Cabinet in each of the last seven presidential administrations by calendar year. (Close readers of FiveThirtyEight may notice that this chart is slightly different from ones that we\u2019ve published in previous articles. That\u2019s because those earlier stories gauged turnover by when a new Cabinet member replaced someone who left, rather than the initial departure date.) A few additional things to keep in mind:\n\nWe didn\u2019t include any roles that were part of the Cabinets of other presidents but not part of Trump\u2019s. For example, Clinton included the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy in his Cabinet, but because the so-called \u201cdrug czar\u201d isn\u2019t in Trump\u2019s Cabinet, we didn\u2019t include that office\u2019s turnover in Clinton\u2019s totals.\n\nSimilarly, a few of the jobs in Trump\u2019s Cabinet didn\u2019t exist in previous administrations \u2014 for example, the posts of secretary of homeland security and director of national intelligence were created during the George W. Bush administration \u2014 which means that earlier presidents had fewer positions available to turn over, potentially deflating their totals in the chart.\n\nOur research doesn\u2019t include acting Cabinet members who stepped aside for permanent appointees.\n\nPeople who left one Cabinet position to join another are included as departures. For instance, when Kelly left the Homeland Security Department to become Trump\u2019s chief of staff, that counted as a departure even though he stayed in the Cabinet. Likewise, the 1985 job swap of Treasury Secretary-turned-chief of staff Don Regan and chief of staff-turned-Treasury Secretary James Baker was noted as two departures in Reagan\u2019s fifth year.\n\nThis last point provides a bit of an asterisk for Trump: His Cabinet turnover isn\u2019t quite as high as it looks because two of his Cabinet members who left their jobs did so to assume another Cabinet-level post. (In addition to Kelly, Mike Pompeo went from being CIA director to secretary of state \u2014 a position he still occupies.) Nevertheless, 10 of the 24 people in Trump\u2019s original Cabinet are gone, and only 13 are holding their original positions. And at the rate they\u2019re going, we may not have to wait long for even more to exit.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/two-years-in-turnover-in-trumps-cabinet-is-still-historically-high/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich"]}]}, "theguardian": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/international", "articles": [{"title": "Introducing the new Guardian app for Android and iOS", "text": "As it happens not after it happened\n\nGet the latest news in real time.

Downing Street sources said the specific issue of sanctions had not come up \u2014 but the treatment of the Uighur people was discussed.\n\nJohnson and Pompeo also talked about how the US and the UK could cooperate on developing next generation technologies, to avoid a situation where a Chinese state-owned company such as Huawei achieves market dominance.\n\nThe US has accused Huawei of achieving its all but unassailable position partly through intellectual property theft.\n\nA couple of hours after meeting Johnson, the secretary of state praised the UK government\u2019s decision to remove Huawei from the UK\u2019s 5G network, as he urged like-minded countries to \u201cpush back\u201d against the actions of Beijing in a press conference.\n\nSpeaking alongside the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, after the pair held talks, Pompeo launched a strongly worded attack on China, including over the Covid-19 pandemic, which he called \u201cpreventable\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese Communist party\u2019s exploitation of this pandemic to further its own aims has been disgraceful,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cRather than helping the world, general secretary Xi [Jinping] has shown the world the party\u2019s true face.\u201d\n\nThe US\u2019s relations with Beijing have soured dramatically during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe UK government had come under significant pressure from Washington, as well as from Conservative backbenchers, over the role of Huawei, and announced last week it would drive out the Chinese provider from the 5G network by 2027.\n\nPompeo welcomed that decision, and the suspension of the UK\u2019s extradition treaty with Hong Kong, which Raab announced on Monday.\n\nThe UK has also promised that up to 3 million Hong Kong residents will be offered the chance to settle in the UK, and a path to permanent citizenship. \u201cWe support those sovereign choices: we think, well done,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nCriticising China\u2019s actions in a series of areas, he said: \u201cYou can\u2019t go and make claim to maritime regions that you have no lawful claim to.

You can\u2019t engage in cover-ups and co-opt international institutions like the World Health Organization.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would like to see the UK go further, he said: \u201cWe want to see every nation who understands freedom and democracy and values that, and knows that it\u2019s important to their own people, to their own sovereign country, to understand the threat that the Chinese Communist party is posing to them, and to work both themselves and collectively to restore what is rightfully ours.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not about language, it\u2019s not about words; we want every nation to work together to push back against the Chinese Communist party\u2019s efforts in every dimension that I have mentioned today.\u201d\n\nTrump has been involved in a high-stakes trade war with China for months over allegations of industrial espionage and currency manipulation.\n\nBut in recent weeks Washington has also imposed sanctions on high-level Chinese officials over human rights abuses against the Muslim minority Uighur people in the western region of Xinjiang.\n\nChina\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, defended his country\u2019s human rights record on Sunday, insisting the Uighur people live in \u201cpeaceful and harmonious coexistence with other ethnic groups\u201d, as he was confronted with footage of shackled prisoners being herded on to trains.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/21/mike-pompeo-attacks-who-in-private-meeting-during-uk-visit", "author": ["Dan Sabbagh", "Heather Stewart"]}, {"title": "First active leak of sea-bed methane discovered in Antarctica", "text": "The first active leak of methane from the sea floor in Antarctica has been revealed by scientists.\n\nThe researchers also found microbes that normally consume the potent greenhouse gas before it reaches the atmosphere had only arrived in small numbers after five years, allowing the gas to escape.\n\nVast quantities of methane are thought to be stored under the sea floor around Antarctica. The gas could start to leak as the climate crisis warms the oceans, a prospect the researchers said was \u201cincredibly concerning\u201d.\n\nThe reason for the emergence of the new seep remains a mystery, but it is probably not global heating, as the Ross Sea where it was found has yet to warm significantly. The research also has significance for climate models, which currently do not account for a delay in the microbial consumption of escaping methane.\n\nThe active seep was first spotted by chance by divers in 2011, but it took scientists until 2016 to return to the site and study it in detail, before beginning laboratory work.\n\n\u201cThe delay [in methane consumption] is the most important finding,\u201d said Andrew Thurber, from Oregon State University in the US, who led the research. \u201cIt is not good news.

It is a 70-metre long patch of white microbial mats, and a second seep was found during the 2016 expedition.\n\n\u201cWe stumbled upon the methane seep at a site that has been dived at since the 1960s and it had just turned on,\u201d said Thurber. There were no bubbles of methane, he said. \u201cMost of the methane in many seeps actually comes out in what we call diffuse flows. So it\u2019s just dissolved in the water.\u201d\n\nThe source of the methane is probably decaying algae deposits buried under sediments and is likely to be thousands of years old. In most parts of the oceans, methane leaking from the sea bed is consumed by microbes in the sediment or the water column above. But the slow growth of microbes at the Cinder Cones site, and its shallow depth, means methane is almost certain to be leaking into the atmosphere.\n\nThurber said the first microbes to grow at the site were of an unexpected strain. \u201cWe\u2019re probably in a successional stage, where it may be five to 10 years before a community becomes fully adapted and starts consuming methane.\u201d\n\nWidespread active methane seepage was reported off the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia in 2014, a first for the Southern Ocean. \u201cBut that\u2019s really a different oceanographic area than the Antarctic continent,\u201d Thurber said.\n\nWadham said the five years for which the Cinder Cones seep has been studied is a short amount of time. \u201cSo it would be good to see what happens to this seep into the future. The discovery also makes you wonder if these features are more common than we might think around Antarctica, but are rarely stumbled upon.\u201d\n\nHowever, the researchers are unlikely to be able to return to Antarctica soon.

Of course, today is an important moment to flag them up and we want to be able to look at the activities, clamp down on the activities of hostile states which threaten the UK but no individual power on its own is going to resolve that; it\u2019s another tool in the armoury but it\u2019s not going to be the only solution.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, we do have very broad powers in existence already for our intelligence and security agencies \u2026\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think it is also true to say that you can always do more with these things and something like the adoption of a form of foreign agent registration might be very useful.

Prior to this effort, according to the Chronicle, no one had tested positive for the virus through nasal swab testing at the park\u2019s health clinic. Scientists at a lab called Biobot Analytics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have examined the sewage water to determine if there are traces of genetic material from Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, in the human feces. From the traces in a given sample, they can estimate how many people passing through Yosemite might be infected with Covid-19 at that time.\n\n\u201cIt just struck me as a really good idea,\u201d said the Mariposa county health official Dr Eric Sergienko. He said that while the county was testing and monitoring local residents, \u201cwe really did not have a really good way of monitoring our visitors for Covid-19.\u201d\n\nThe county began testing the wastewater from the Yosemite Valley, where thecelebrated granite Half Dome is located, in June. Based on their findings, health officials believe that an estimated 170 people in the park the week of the Fourth of July may have been infected with the coronavirus. The following week, that number dropped to 60.\n\nIn the neighboring community where wastewater is also tested, the estimate went down from 60 to 50 over that same two-week period. \u201cFor me that suggests that indeed the volume that we saw on the Fourth was directly related to visitors to the area,\u201d says Sergienko.\n\n'Not a mask in sight': thousands flock to Yellowstone as park reopens Read more\n\nFor now, Mariposa county will continue testing the sewage water every week, and maintaining safety protocols currently in place.\n\nThe park closed its gates in March \u2013 partly, according to Sergienko, to avoid straining the local healthcare system with sick travelers. Now, the park requires visitors to make reservations to get in and has cut attendance by about half of what it was in June 2019. The park works closely with neighboring counties to implement safety measures. But since the national parks are under federal jurisdiction, it cannot force visitors to wear masks, for example.\n\nKristen Brengel of the National Parks Conservation Association, a non-partisan group that advocates to protect national parks, said this decision came from the top. \u201cThe political appointees of the interior department have made it clear they do not want to make masks mandatory in parks. They\u2019re doing this by choice.\u201d Most parks are only able to recommend that visitors wear masks.\n\nBrengel also says crowding at popular outdoor sites is a risk to visitor and employee health. Photos on the Yellowstone national park\u2019s Facebook page show crowds lined up for its famous geysers, with about half the people wearing masks. In Yosemite, timed entry is helping space out crowds, and Brengel says a handful of other parks, including Denali national park and reserve and Rocky Mountain national park are implementing this tactic.\n\nThe National Park Service did not return a request for comment, but a public health update on its website asks visitors \u201cto be our partner in adopting social distancing practices when visiting parks\u201d.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/22/yosemite-coronavirus-covid-19-sewage-tests", "author": ["Paulina Velasco"]}, {"title": "'No exemptions\u2019 but Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban reportedly allowed to quarantine at NSW holiday home", "text": "The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has said there are \u201cno exemptions\u201d from hotel quarantine for returned travellers despite reports Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban were allowed to isolate at their holiday home in regional NSW.\n\nMedia outlets reported on Tuesday that Kidman and Urban, and their two daughters, flew back to Sydney from the United States on a private jet and were allowed to isolate at their home in Sutton Forest ahead of the filming of Kidman\u2019s new mini-series, Nine Perfect Strangers, in August.\n\nPre-production will be done at the home, with filming in a number of locations across NSW, including Byron Bay.\n\nIF.com.au reported that an agreement had been reached between the federal government, Screen Australia and the NSW government to allow the overseas cast to quarantine in Australia for 14 days at an unspecified facility.\n\nBerejiklian on Wednesday said the cast and crew had not been given an exemption but were allowed to quarantine at a separate location from the hotels currently being used to hold other people returning from overseas.\n\n\u201cApparently there is strict quarantine, it\u2019s just a question of where you have the quarantine, and the whole film crew is all in one hotel,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe only issue there was the location of the quarantine but please know that everybody, it doesn\u2019t matter who they are \u2013 can I be very clear on this \u2013 there is no exemption for anybody from quarantine and that\u2019s why NSW has been so successful.\u201d\n\nBerejiklian said the health department had ensured quarantine was being enforced and health officials \u201chave been all over it with a fine-tooth comb and made sure that\u2019s in place\u201d.\n\nUnder NSW rules for returned travellers, except in very limited circumstances on medical, health, or compassionate grounds, everyone is required to stay in pre-arranged hotel accomodation in strict quarantining for 14 days.

The reasons were multifold: cancelled appointments; difficulty in reaching their GP or community mental health teams; being turned away by crisis services or issues accessing digital services.\n\n\u201cPeople needed to externalise what was going on\u201d\n\nIn Mind\u2019s day-to-day work, the charity had a drop in the volume of calls to its helpline; a phenomenon that may have been due to people putting their mental health issues on the backburner while they coped with the immediate and practical pressures of the pandemic, or reduced privacy and time pressures brought about by homeschooling and homeworking.\n\nHowever, the average length of the calls increased by about two minutes in April and May, something the charity says may reflect an increase in the complexity of callers\u2019 needs.\n\nStephen Buckley, Mind\u2019s head of information, said: \u201cThe fact that our calls were getting longer is evidence that people did just want to talk, and needed to externalise what was going on \u2026 we extended the average call time in response to callers needing a bit more of a listening ear.\u201d\n\nEmerging from lockdown\n\nAs the country adjusts to less severe lockdown restrictions, Mind is encouraging anyone who may be struggling with their mental health to reach out.\n\nBuckley said: \u201cIsolation, fear and grief are all taking their toll, and we know that so many people who have tried to access support have not been able to.

That became impossible\u2019", "text": "Dinner in the Trump household was a hierarchical affair. Fred Trump, the patriarch, sat at the head of the table, with son Donald on his right and daughter Maryanne on his left. Other family members took their places in descending order of assigned importance.\n\nBut one Thanksgiving, the eldest son, Fred Jr, found himself relegated to the junior end of the table with his daughter Mary. \u201cDuring the course of the meal, my grandmother choked,\u201d Mary Trump recalls. \u201cMy dad had been a volunteer ambulance driver in the late 60s and early 70s so he knew the Heimlich manoeuvre and he very gently manoeuvred her into the kitchen and gave her the Heimlich, and that basically saved her from choking.\n\n\u201cNobody else moved; everybody kept eating. It was a sort of awkward, embarrassing thing that Gam [her nickname] choked. When they came back in, it was literally like my dad had just taken out the garbage: \u2018Oh, yeah. Good job, Freddy.\u2019 He couldn\u2019t do anything at that point to garner any respect or get credit for anything, even if it was saving their mother.\u201d\n\nThere is no understanding Donald Trump without understanding his \u201cmalignantly dysfunctional family\u201d, according to Mary, the first member of the clan to publish a Trump biography and question his fitness for office. Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man sold nearly a million copies on its first day of publication last week, after a failed attempt by the US president\u2019s younger brother Robert to block it in court.\n\nHe learned that being humiliated was the worst thing that could happen to a person and he would do everything in his power to avoid that feeling\n\nThe book is a portrait of something rotten at the heart of a white suburban family\u2019s rapacious pursuit of the American dream. When I speak to Mary, 55, over the phone from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, she describes how her \u201csociopath\u201d grandfather made Trump the man he is today, reflects on the burden of carrying the Trump name and warns against the prospect of the president\u2019s children running for political office.\n\nFred Trump is the villain of the piece. This ruthless New York workaholic slept about four hours a night and was driven by money. Mary writes that he showed little interest in his five children other than grooming an heir for his property business. Spurning his eldest son, Freddy, he settled on Donald, deciding that his second son\u2019s \u201carrogance and bullying\u201d, and willingness to lie and cheat, were just what the office needed.\n\n\u201cIf you met him,\u201d says Mary of her grandfather, \u201cyou would think he was cheerful and positive, but also intimidating and not a warm person. But deep down I have no problem describing him as a sociopath. He had no real human feeling and he treated his children variously with contempt.\n\n\u201cCertainly, in the case of my dad, who was the oldest son, heir apparent and namesake, there was harsh discipline and humiliation which Donald, seven and a half years younger, was able to witness and learn very specific lessons from: don\u2019t be like Freddy, don\u2019t be kind, don\u2019t be generous, don\u2019t have \u2018frivolous\u2019 interests. The other lesson he learned was that being humiliated was the worst thing that could happen to a person and he would do everything in his power to avoid the feeling of humiliation.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump as a child. Photograph: @realdonaldtrump/Instagram\n\nIt does not take much imagination to picture torturous family dinners with giant clashing egos. Racist and antisemitic language was common, Mary has said during media interviews to promote the book, noting the Trumps lived in what was then an all-white suburb in Queens, New York. Can she remember a specific example of Trump using the N-word?\n\n\u201cHonestly, no, because it was just this thing that happened. If my dad had said it outside of the house when we were with him that would have stood out, but he never did. In my grandparents\u2019 house, it was just commonplace and there was nothing, unfortunately, remarkable about it.\u201d\n\nMary is convinced that her uncle is racist. Would she also use terms such as fascist and white supremacist? \u201cI don\u2019t think he has any political ideology. For him, this is just expedient. I would say he behaves like a white supremacist, certainly. He\u2019s acting on his own racism. He\u2019s doing racist things that are endangering people of colour in this country. That\u2019s much more important, so whether he would describe himself as a white supremacist or not, he\u2019s certainly acting like one.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, the Nation magazine ran an article headlined: \u201cHave You Ever Seen Donald Trump Laugh?\u201d It pointed out that almost no one has. What about Mary, a licensed psychologist? \u201cNo, and my grandfather didn\u2019t laugh either. When you are able to laugh you\u2019re also letting your guard down and that was frowned upon. My dad had a great sense of humour; he was a very funny guy and did know how to laugh. I think with my grandfather it was also because he was not a fully human being.\u201d\n\nHer book alleges that Trump paid someone to take a university entrance exam on his behalf; the White House has denied this. Freddy briefly went into the family business but loathed it, quitting to become an airline pilot. He died alone in hospital at 42 after a struggle with alcoholism, which runs deep in the family.\n\nMary holds her grandfather responsible. \u201cThe worst thing my grandfather did, starting from very early on, was just not accept my father for who he is. As soon as he realised that my dad wasn\u2019t the \u2018right kind of person\u2019 \u2013 he wasn\u2019t \u2018a killer\u2019, he wasn\u2019t \u2018tough\u2019 \u2013 he dismissed him out of hand and quickly found a replacement in Donald.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump with his father Fred in Brooklyn, 1975. Photograph: Donald Trump/Facebook\n\nTrump now finds himself in the role of patriarch. He, too, was a distant father who did not, for example, involve himself in changing nappies but encouraged his children to join the family property empire. His sons, Don Jr and Eric, have become two of his most aggressive campaign surrogates, while his elder daughter, Ivanka, is a senior adviser at the White House.\n\nMary, who is more than a decade older than her cousins and does not know them, says: \u201cIt seems pretty clear to me they believe the way to get their father\u2019s attention is through cruelty and subservience, and it\u2019s a quite awful thing to see.\u201d\n\nBoth Don Jr and Ivanka have been, half-jokingly, half-deadly seriously, touted as potential future candidates for president. If a shudder can be felt down a phone line, it comes now. \u201cIf that were allowed, that would be wrong,\u201d Mary says. \u201cThey\u2019re unqualified. Ivanka is the only one technically in the government and she\u2019s unqualified to be an aide, let alone run for political office.\n\n\u201cNone of them has ever done anything on their own. They\u2019ve worked in their dad\u2019s business and, from what I can tell, they really haven\u2019t done anything else except continue to take advantage of family money. So I think that would speak to an enduring bankruptcy in the Republican party if that were to come to pass.\u201d\n\nIndeed, perhaps a more interesting question than Trump\u2019s narcissism is what his ascent says about the US. He has shone a harsh light on the nation\u2019s divisions, inequalities, insecurities, negative partisanship, neuroses and prejudices \u2013 and how far some are willing to go for a taste of power.\n\n\u201cThat is the one thing I didn\u2019t anticipate,\u201d Mary goes on. \u201cOne of the reasons I was so devastated by what happened in November 2016 was because, while I knew that he was categorically unfit and incompetent and cruel, I never foresaw that 100% of Republicans in office would just enable him to the extent they have.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been horrifying because, in that sense, he\u2019s not the problem. If he were being held to the same standards other people in his position have been held to, if they had cared about the transgressions he\u2019s made, the lines he\u2019s crossed, then he would have been neutralised, at least reined in. But they\u2019ve given him permission to keep going and doubling down.\u201d\n\nThe Trump siblings (from left): Robert, Elizabeth, Fred Jr, Donald and Maryanne. Photograph: Donald Trump Campaign\n\nShe has also witnessed Trump\u2019s lies, exaggerations and salesmanship up close. When she first met his wife, Melania, Trump said to his niece: \u201cYou dropped out of college, right?\u201d He then commented: \u201cIt was really bad for a while \u2013 and then she started doing drugs.\u201d\n\nMary says she has never taken drugs in her life, but Trump relishes a good comeback story. \u201cIt\u2019s just a power play. He knew he was lying. He knew I knew he was lying. But he enjoys that kind of thing.\u201d It is a telling anecdote about Trump\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t let the facts get in the way of a good story\u201d attitude that seeks to make his audience, and the media, complicit.\n\nMary and her brother engaged in a protracted legal fight over Fred\u2019s estate after his death in 1999 but she otherwise maintained a low profile, despite sharing her last name with a man who spent decades as a star of New York tabloids, reality TV and now the Washington swamp.\n\n\u201cI have always flown under the radar up until recently; I guess that\u2019s not the case any more,\u201d she muses. \u201cWhen I was really young, it wasn\u2019t an issue because nobody knew who my grandfather was outside of New York.\n\n\u201cIt became more of a complicating factor when I was in college and I learned very early on that if somebody asked me \u2013 which happened 100% of the time when I paid with a cheque or used a credit card \u2013 if I was related, I just said no because it was so much easier. So even people I became friends with didn\u2019t know for a long time. It\u2019s been a burden simply knowing that it\u2019s been my uncle who is doing these awful things but, for me personally, not really.\u201d\n\nMary voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and senator Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 Democratic primary but is fully behind presumptive nominee Joe Biden for November. \u201cI will do whatever I can do to help him get elected.\u201d Asked if she would accept an invitation to speak at next month\u2019s Democratic national convention, she says simply: \u201cThat would be an honour.\u201d\n\nBiden currently has a significant lead in opinion polls but what if, despite everything, Trump wins re-election? \u201cI have a very difficult time thinking about that but I think the simplest and most clear way to put it is that it would be, in my view, the end of the American experiment. The fact that people were willing to do it four years ago was devastating; that anybody would think that it\u2019s a good idea to continue along the lines we\u2019re going now is unthinkable.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump with father Fred, first wife Ivana and son Donald Jr. Photograph: Time Life Pictures/The Life Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nMary last spoke to the president at her aunt\u2019s birthday party at the White House in April 2017 and has no interest in doing so again. In 2018, she secretly helped New York Times reporters on an investigation that outlined how Trump and his siblings avoided millions of dollars in taxes.\n\nDoes she love her uncle? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she says without hesitation. \u201cI used to feel compassion for him. I really did. But then that became impossible when I started learning about things that he had done and seeing what he\u2019s been doing since January 20, 2017.\u201d\n\nMary\u2019s guidebook to the Trump psychological labyrinth is an argument for the notion that the child is father of the man. If we are all products of our circumstances, does Trump deserve some pity? She is adamant again. \u201cNo, he does not. I completely understand having sympathy and empathy for the child who did suffer mightily but it\u2019s no excuse for his behaviour.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an adult human being who knows the difference between right and wrong, even though he doesn\u2019t think the rules apply to him. He knows what he\u2019s doing and one of the reasons we\u2019re in this position is because he\u2019s never been held accountable for anything. So his transgressions become more egregious over time and he needs to be held to account.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man by Mary Trump is \u00a317.40 (RRP \u00a320) at guardianbookshop.com", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/22/mary-donald-trump-interview-bestseller-racism-incompetence-cruelty", "author": ["David Smith"]}, {"title": "From sizzling shashlik to spicy seekh kebabs: barbecue recipes from around the world", "text": "Forget burgers, ribs and hot dogs \u2013 outdoor grilling isn\u2019t only popular in the US.

Looking for fresh barbecue inspiration this summer? It is time to broaden your horizons.\n\nThe Philippines\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chicken and pork barbecued Filipino style. Photograph: junpinzon/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nCooking outdoors is standard in the Philippines. \u201cYou\u2019re probably considered middle-class if you have an inside kitchen,\u201d says Rachel Stockley, a chef of Filipino heritage who cooks at Baratxuri in Manchester.\n\n\u201cLike Thai food, Filipino is all about hot, sour, sweet, salty flavours,\u201d says Stockley, with sawsawan dipping sauces essential in that. Commercial versions can include a variety of ingredients, even strawberries, but the basic recipe is equal parts white sugar cane vinegar or rice wine vinegar and light soy mixed with finely diced white onion, garlic, chilli, lime juice and fish sauce \u2013 \u201cFilipino patis if you can get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat condiment or salsa is used with everything from barbecued pork belly to grilled tilapia,\u201d says Stockley, but building in those four dimensions of flavour can begin much earlier, too. Before it is grilled, explains Mary San Pablo, the owner of London supper club and delivery kitchen Luto, pork or chicken is \u201chalf-brined, half-marinated\u201d in an approximate mix of equal parts lemonade (usually 7Up or Sprite), soy sauce and sugar cane vinegar (watered-down cider vinegar, alternatively), with added garlic and pepper and sometimes extra sugar and banana ketchup. Lemongrass is also beaten into the marinade and then used as a brush to baste the meat as it caramelises on the grill.\n\nSan Pablo recommends marinating skewers of interspersed fatty pork belly and shoulder overnight: \u201cYou want a deep flavour penetration.\u201d Serve your pork or chicken with grilled corn or barbecued aubergines, scooping out the flesh and topping it with tomatoes, chopped shallots and toyomansi, a mix of soy and juice from the Philippines\u2019 beloved calamansi citrus fruit. You can substitute lemon and lime for calamansi, but, if you are really keen, Ikea sells small calamansi, AKA calamondin, trees and San Pablo has harvested \u201cquite a lot of juice\u201d from these.\n\nThe Caribbean\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Grilled jerk chicken. Photograph: myViewPoint/Alamy\n\n\u201cFrom an early age going to St Vincent, I vividly remember the Friday night \u2018jump-off\u2019 \u2013 barbecues where there\u2019d be various meats in West Indian spices, jerk chicken being the classic,\u201d says James Cochran, chef-owner at London\u2019s Around the Cluck.\n\nUsed on ingredients from goat to red snapper, jerk is both a dry rub and a glazing liquid used during cooking. Perfecting your rub could take years. Cochran\u2019s contains 15 finely balanced ingredients ranging from garlic and onion powder to nutmeg, smoked paprika and essential Jamaican allspice or pimento. Unusually, however, he does not use it as a dry rub. He prefers to brine chicken thighs in a 10% salt solution with plenty of the jerk seasoning for four hours. To get a nice balance of heat and smoke, he only uses Scotch bonnet chillies in his glaze \u2013 which he makes from rum, guava jam or honey and jerk spices.\n\nSides of fried plantain, spinach-like callaloo and rice and peas can be cooked ahead and served cold so you can concentrate on barbecuing. But, says Shaun McAnuff, half of Jamaican food exponents Original Flava, jerk-seasoned vegetables and even fruits are increasingly common at Jamaican barbecues, partly inspired by the vegetarian Ital diet followed by many Rastafarians. McAnuff also suggests abandoning burger buns for festival, a sub-shaped, slightly sweet fried cornmeal roll: \u201cThey\u2019re predominantly eaten with fish but they\u2019re great for carnival street food and barbecues, hence the name.\u201d\n\nTo drink, Cochran demands rum punch: \u201cRum, grenadine and nutmeg with orange, pineapple or guava juice, shaken with loads of ice. Lethal!\u201d\n\nIndia and Pakistan\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lamb chops on the grill in Islamabad, Pakistan. Photograph: dbimages/Alamy\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as Indian food,\u201d says the food writer and chef Romy Gill. \u201cIt\u2019s very regional. We all speak different languages, look different, eat different.\u201d\n\nThat variety offers plenty of barbecue inspiration for dishes such as Gill\u2019s Punjabi-style chicken wings marinated in ginger, garlic, fresh turmeric, honey, green chillies and lime juice, or her Keralan-style beef or jackfruit ribs flavoured with tamarind chutney, tandoori masala spices, ginger and garlic. \u201cCook them on a quick high burst of heat,\u201d advises the Ready Steady Cook regular, \u201cand then gently so the outside is charcoaled dark and the inside beautifully pink.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, you could start with simple skewers of cubed meats marinated in a paste of ginger, garlic, green chillies and garam masala. Tip: use grated raw green papaya to tenderise tougher meats such as goat or mutton. Later, move on to perfecting your minced seekh kebabs. Use seasoned lamb that is about 20% fat. \u201cWithout fat it\u2019s not really tasty,\u201d says Gill. Thread a tennis-sized ball of mince on to the bottom of a skewer, then tease and stretch into shape with wet fingers, no oil: \u201cThe moment you use oil it\u2019s going to fall down.\u201d If you want to wrap your kebab in a naan with salad and chutneys, you can bake naans on the BBQ by cooking them on foil or on a baking tray over the coals.\n\nAcross the wider Indian subcontinent, the opportunity to drill down into specific authentic flavours is endless, says Sumayya Usmani, Pakistani food expert and the owner of Glasgow\u2019s Kaleyard Cook School and Kitchen. For instance, Afghani-influenced kebabs of skewered lamb use just a light lemon and salt marinade: \u201cThe rest of the flavour comes from smaller alternating pieces of lamb fat or dark meat.\u201d Conversely, Karachi\u2019s chicken tikka packs in the spice. Chickens are quartered on the bone and marinated, not in yoghurt, but in lemon juice with ground Kashmiri chillies, ginger, garlic, green chilli paste, salt, ground cumin, garam masala and turmeric: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely red and slit so the flavours go right to the bone.\u201d\n\nRussia\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shashlik in Vladivostok, Russia. Photograph: Photograph by Kangheewan./Getty Images\n\nOn fine days, even in winter, Alissa Timoshkina\u2019s family would regularly head out into the Siberian woodlands outside Omsk to cook over fire. \u201cIt is,\u201d says the author of Salt & Time, \u201ca big part of my culinary culture.\u201d\n\nRugged shashlik kebabs of beer-marinated pork or Georgian-style beef, the chunks of meat divided by pieces of onion, were the centrepiece of such meals. The beef is marinated in red wine, tomatoes and onions and, before grilling, is rubbed with the Georgian herb mix khmeli suneli. Specialist suppliers such as Seasoned Pioneers sell it pre-mixed or you could attempt your own. It is complex but apart from a couple of ingredients available from herb nerds such as Steenbergs (summer savory, marigold), uses readily available dried herbs, including (depending which recipe you work from) marjoram, dill, mint, parsley, coriander, fenugreek leaves and seeds, black pepper and bay leaves.\n\nThe meat would be swiped from the skewer using Armenian lavash flatbreads and perhaps dressed with homemade Georgian chilli sauce known as adjika, thickened with concentrated tomato puree: \u201cIn the Soviet days, there were no ready bought sauces.\u201d In summer, shashlik might be bundled together with pickles and salads of seasonal vegetables dressed with unrefined sunflower oil and dominated by \u201ccrazy amounts of chopped parsley, dill and coriander, so herbs are the bulk of the salad\u201d. Note: if you cannot find lavash in local Turkish or Kurdish shops, tortillas or chapattis will work as a stand-in.\n\nFinally, the family would cook jacket potatoes as the fire subsided, throwing them in without foil and, later, topping them with \u201creally fatty, super-rich sour cream, dill and chopped garlic\u201d, scooping the insides from ashy jackets with a spoon: \u201cWe\u2019d have it as a side but it\u2019s a meal in itself.\u201d\n\nPeru\n\nYou might balk at digging up the back garden for pachamanca, Peru\u2019s famous submerged fire-pit feast. But anticuchos, marinated skewers similar to the Japanese yakitori, is a Peruvian obsession we can all get into.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A street vendor selling chicken and anticuchos in the Barranco district of Lima. Photograph: Bernard Golden/Alamy\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge tradition behind it,\u201d says the chef at Birmingham\u2019s Chakana, Robert Ortiz, a man who discovered his talent for cooking during a school barbecue contest. \u201cAnticuchos was done at weekends on street corners and families would gather to eat. Now anticucheria restaurants just do the skewers.\u201d\n\nTraditionally made with deliciously beefy ox heart and other bits of offal, anticuchos now incorporate everything from chicken to octopus and chorizo. The marinade is always the same, however, based around aji panca, a smoky, fruity chilli you can find dried or in paste form online. The skewers are marinated overnight in (this would cover 40 to 50, for a party), 1kg of pureed rehydrated chillies, let down with water; 200g garlic puree; four bay leaves; 100ml white wine vinegar; 60g sugar; 40g salt; 20g each of cumin and ground black pepper.\n\nServe the anticuchos with boiled and barbecued corn cobs and waxy potatoes (eg Charlotte, Jersey Royals). Dress them with a simple salsa of onion, coriander, fresh chilli and lime juice or aji verde, a smoothly blended sauce of yellow aji amarillo paste, lots of coriander, garlic, onion and a few blobs of mayonnaise.

Read more\n\nThen, in late March, \u201ccommerce came to a crashing halt,\u201d the editorial board of GoErie, the local paper of record, lamented, as the county was placed under a stay-at-home order due to the pandemic.\n\nMore bad news would follow. In late April, the local Wabtec plant permanently laid off 300 frontline workers who make locomotives, saying national rail traffic was down 10%. By mid-May the unemployment rate was about 13%, up from 3.6% the prior year.\n\nThis could all be bad news for Donald Trump because what happens in Erie county \u2013 economically and politically \u2013 has been of national import since November 2016 when the longtime Democratic stronghold swung narrowly for him. Trump\u2019s victory \u2013 by fewer than 2,000 votes in Erie \u2013 helped deliver him Pennsylvania and the presidency, even as he lost the popular vote.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Erie Coke Corp plant in Erie, Pennsylvania, which closed at the end of 2019, having faced regulatory pressure over its environmental record.

But it also suffers from economic stagnation and sky-high levels of racial inequality. Between 2017 and 2018, Erie County\u2019s median income declined in spite of the economic expansion. It\u2019s also home to one of the poorest ZIP codes in the United States.\n\nErie resident Sydney Zimmerman, 27, has had a virtual front-row seat to the unfolding events of the last few months from the pandemic, its economic fallout, and the mass protests following the killing of George Floyd.\n\nShe has been engaging in a canvassing operation as part of her work for Erie County United, a progressive advocacy organization.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sydney Zimmermann says she has spoken to residents struggling in the wake of the pandemic. Photograph: Joanne Kim\n\nShe says she\u2019s spoken to residents struggling to get food or to appointments after the bus system cut routes and rideshares became untenable. She said some residents wanted Covid-19 tests but could not afford them, and she has spoken to others who have struggled to secure unemployment insurance.\n\nErie county has not been one of the state\u2019s hotspots, but it has been one of the slower counties to meet the state\u2019s standards for reopening, causing economic strain. Zimmerman says the pandemic and the protests against police brutality have only \u201cexaggerated people\u2019s feelings\u201d about politics.\n\nAnd yet there are some \u201csleepers who are waking up\u201d, according to Zimmerman. She recalls a conversation with a waitress whose concern about college debt had her thinking she might be a closet Democrat. That\u2019s the job of Erie United, to activate residents around a set of progressive issues.\n\nSome data points suggest that Erie voters might be turning against Trump. A research firm conducting online focus groups in more than a half-dozen states found that seven of nine Erie swing voters would have supported Joe Biden if the election were held in mid-June. That shift was the first that contained more opponents than supporters of Trump since the Engagious/Schlesinger Group began its research of swing voters in March of last year.\n\nThe RealClear Politics average of state-level polls gives Biden a 6.5 point lead in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really conflicted about the race problem\u2019\n\nStill many of Trump\u2019s supporters are sticking by him. Verel Salmon, a part-time farmer, and chair of the Erie county Republican party, draws hope from the number of Democrats who have switched their party registration to Republican in recent years.\n\nHe said he recently stood in a line of socially distanced farmers at a cooperative feed mill who seemed happy with the president. The aid to farmers had taken the \u201cedge off the loss\u201d created by the tariffs the president had imposed. \u201cYou can go into any store or Walmart and hear very similar sentiments,\u201d Salmon said.\n\nThe economy is the first reason Judy Phelps gives when explaining her support of Trump. Phelps, a 72-year-old retired social worker voted for Obama in 2012 before throwing her strong support to Trump in 2016.\n\nI\u2019m really conflicted about the race problem. Is it manufactured, or is it a real problem? Judy Phelps\n\n\u201cThe economy is better. I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s done a lot for the veterans. He\u2019s done a lot for the country as far as protecting us,\u201d says Phelps, an avid fan of Fox News who wasn\u2019t that focused on politics until Trump came along.\n\nPhelps\u2019 work with people living with addiction has given her empathy for people who have made mistakes in life, she says. However, she says she is unsure what to think about the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cI\u2019m really conflicted about the race problem. Is it manufactured, or is it a real problem?\u201d she said.\n\nRecent polls show support for the Black Lives Matter movement shot up precipitously after protests erupted around the country, including in Erie. The vast majority of Republicans maintain a negative perception of the movement, according to Civiqs, a daily tracking of registered voters.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m just looking for a decent human being\u2019\n\nVoters like Kim Snyder, 26, could make the difference in 2020. She\u2019d voted for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary, and cast a ballot for the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, in the general, deeming Hillary Clinton a hawk and untrustworthy.\n\nIn June, Snyder cast her ballot for Biden in the Pennsylvania primary. She was drawing state unemployment insurance for the first time, and said she was waiting for her job as a spa manager to begin again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kim Snyder, 26, is hoping for a candidate who will listen to scientists. Photograph: Joanne Kim\n\n\u201cI have concerns about Biden, but he seems like a significantly less bad option,\u201d says Snyder. She wants someone who would appoint a competent cabinet and listen to scientists. \u201cBasically, I\u2019m just looking for a decent human being.\u201d\n\nWilliam Panitzke, a business agent for the Steamfitter\u2019s Local 449, seems like he\u2019s in a similar frame of mind, concerned about Trump\u2019s suitability as a leader.\n\nAn independent by temperament, he\u2019s a registered Democrat who votes his union\u2019s interest, but, at times, he feels conflicted. Most of his Erie county members work in construction and many are back at work. But he represents all of western Pennsylvania, where steamfitters have jobs in the energy sector \u2013 in coal, natural gas, at the Shell cracker plant 220 miles south in Beaver county, where Trump held a press conference last August.\n\n\u201cDo you support the guy that\u2019s going to help your industry and keep your guys working, or the one who wants to end your industry but keep your collective bargaining rights?\u201d Panitzke said. (Biden has said he would ban new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters, but has not proposed banning fracking as Republicans have claimed.)\n\nStill, he finds Trump\u2019s governing style anathema, particularly his treatment of the former US secretary of defense James Mattis, who he says is revered by former marines like himself.\n\nIn Erie, like everywhere else, small businesses \u2013 including restaurants \u2013 have suffered mightily. George Gourlias, who owns Bistro 26 with his wife, said business is down 60 or 70% and he would be sunk without the paycheck protection program (PPP) loan.\n\nEven so, he worries about how he will pay it back. In order for it to be forgiven, the loan contract requires that he maintain full employment, an impossibility, he says, when he\u2019s gone down from serving 20 tables to nothing during the earlier period of restrictions (restaurants can now welcome customers at 50% capacity).\n\nDisparities\n\nAs a restaurateur in a purple county, Gourlias, who is 51, would rather not talk about politics. But Gary Horton, who heads the local NAACP chapter, doesn\u2019t mind broaching the subject. \u201cI see blue,\u201d he says, assuming there is no voter suppression.\n\nHorton, speaking while he was working on getting essential workers to access to Covid-19 testing and coordinating the distribution of hot meals to vulnerable residents. Black residents, and some white people, \u201crecognize the disparities that the pandemic uncovered, and they don\u2019t want to go back to what some other people call normal\u201d, Horton said.\n\nRacial disparities are stark. Erie county made it on to 24/7 Wall Street\u2019s list of 15 worst places for African Americans to live in last year, and Erie had one of the highest black mortality rates of any metro area, according to that report.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gary Horton, president of the Erie chapter of the NAACP. Photograph: Joanne Kim\n\nIn 2018, the poverty rate among African Americans \u2013 who make up about 7% of the county\u2019s population \u2013 was 39%, compared with 13% for white residents. Latinos \u2013 a smaller share of the population \u2013 face even higher poverty rates of 45%. Those disparities are exacerbated by the state\u2019s rock-bottom minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, the same as the federal minimum wage.\n\nHorton is also concerned about Erie\u2019s new arrivals; he runs a non-profit that serves refugees from places including Kosovo, Iraq, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania, who make up about 16% of the city\u2019s population, according to city officials. Some are prosperous and run businesses, and others require assistance.\n\nDeng William Rag fled Sudan\u2019s civil war for Erie, and a string of low-wage jobs, including at McDonald\u2019s and a plastics factory.\n\nFluent in three languages, he returned to school and now, at 49, is a case manager at the Erie Housing Authority. In mid-May, when Erie was still under the stay-at-home orders, he was delivering meals to residents of Harbor Homes, a public housing project. The need was apparent. \u201cMost of the time we find them waiting at the door,\u201d he said.\n\nRag thinks that the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic will only energize the county\u2019s population of New Americans \u2013 the preferred term for refugees as many of them are citizens and, like Rag, have been in the country for years. They are already repelled by the president\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, he said.\n\n\u201cI just came back from distributing meals [and] early voting ballot forms,\u201d said Rag. \u201cThe first thing they were telling us is \u2018let\u2019s vote Trump out of office.\u2019\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/22/erie-pennsylvania-democrats-trump-supporters-election", "author": ["Jessica Goodheart"]}, {"title": "'She's a household name': Nia Wilson's mother on the impact of her daughter's death", "text": "Amost two years after Nia Wilson was stabbed to death on a train platform in Oakland, California, a judge last week sentenced the man convicted of her murder to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nTo Wilson\u2019s family, John Lee Cowell\u2019s sentencing marks the end of a lengthy and high-profile trial. \u201cIt feels like all of this started yesterday, and at the same time it feels like the process took forever,\u201d said Alicia Grayson, Wilson\u2019s mother. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey and having the verdict is bittersweet.\u201d\n\nWilson was murdered on the night of 22 July 2018 while boarding a Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) train with her older sisters Letifah and Tashiya Wilson. Alameda prosecutors said in court that Cowell, then 27, had followed the three sisters on to a train half an hour before, and stabbed Nia and Letifah in their necks as the sisters prepared to transfer to a different train.\n\n\u2018Justice is never served\u2019: Nia Wilson and the fear of racial violence Read more\n\nCowell was arrested the following day at a different Bart station and later charged with Nia\u2019s murder and the attempted murder of Letifah.\n\nCowell\u2019s trial officially began in January 2020. Cowell pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and his family and attorney insisted that the stabbing was the result of a mental health episode, citing a lengthy history of psychosis. A jury convicted him of the murder and attempted murder of the two Wilson sisters in March. Days into the jury\u2019s deliberation an Oakland judge ruled Cowell was \u201csane\u201d at the time of the murders, paving the way for the July sentencing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wilson\u2019s father, Ansar El Muhammad, left, and her mother, Alicia Grayson, at a news conference in 2018.

We grew up together and spent summers in the same house.\u201d Nia was the youngest sibling, and she and Brown bonded by making music in his studio when she got older. \u201cShe was over here all the time. Now, she\u2019s not here, and I\u2019m used to seeing her all the time,\u201d he said.\n\nBrown described the court process as deeply traumatizing. \u201cI\u2019m relieved because we don\u2019t have to wake up in the morning to go to court. Every time we went it felt like we were reliving the moment over again. But I\u2019ll never really feel relief because she\u2019s not here. She was young and we planned a whole lifetime. We expected her to grow up with all of us.\u201d\n\nCowell\u2019s sentencing comes amid a national reckoning over racial injustice and violence against Black Americans. As protests erupted across the country following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, Wilson\u2019s name was again pushed to the forefront of the longstanding conversation around violence against Black women.\n\nNo one wants their child immortalized like this, but the blessing is that they\u2019ll never forget about her Alicia Grayson\n\nLast week, the Oakland-based artist DeAndre Drake, who goes by Airballin, unveiled a casket featuring Wilson\u2019s face amid about a dozen other portraits of Black Americans including Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor.\n\nSeeing her daughter recognized nationally has been a humbling experience, said Wilson\u2019s mother. She recalled seeing a young man pointing at her daughter\u2019s image on Drake\u2019s casket and asking: \u201cIs that Breonna or Nia?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe told him who we were, and it was so humbling that Nia is a household name. It was like it could have been his sister, cousin or auntie,\u201d Grayson said.\n\nCowell was never charged with a hate crime, but race was a central theme in the coverage of the murder and throughout the court proceedings. As news of Wilson\u2019s murder became national news and images of Cowell circulated, so did speculation that Cowell was a white supremacist who killed Wilson out of hatred.\n\nAnd her death again put the spotlight on the frequency with which Black women are murdered. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that Black women die of homicide at a rate almost higher than Hispanic, White, and Asian women combined.\n\nStill, Wilson\u2019s mother says that Cowell\u2019s conviction is a win in the long battle toward racial justice.\n\n\u201cNia wasn\u2019t killed by the police, but people still say her name,\u201d Grayson said of the recent resurgence in attention to her daughter\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing and curse,\u201d she continued. \u201cNo one wants their child immortalized like this, but the blessing is that they\u2019ll never forget about her.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/22/nia-wilson-bart-oakland-murder-mother-interview", "author": ["Aben\u00e9 Clayton"]}, {"title": "Women's transfer window summer 2020 \u2013 all deals from Europe's top five leagues", "text": "What term do you want to search?

So, so incredibly bad.\n\nIt\u2019s an aspect of the \u201cSeattle freeze\u201d \u2013 my city\u2019s notoriously passive-aggressive, polite, reserved nature that we\u2019ve honed into performance art. We\u2019re willing to engage in polite banter, but then we will shut you down if you want anything more than that.\n\nOne theory is that, as a city, we\u2019re too passive to get ourselves out of awkward conversations, so we\u2019d rather just avoid getting too far into them. We won\u2019t look at you when we cross paths with you on the sidewalk, but we\u2019re happy to give you directions if you ask. We\u2019ll smile and wave you off, and then put our earbuds back in and lower our eyes and ignore each other again.\n\nWe\u2019re so, so nice, but so, so distant.\n\nIn 2016, I was coming off a massive midlife shitshow \u2013 a triple punch of medical crisis, mortality check, and abrupt divorce. I would float down the streets of Capitol Hill, my Seattle neighborhood, not needing to blink because I was in a state of almost constant tearing. My social filters were blown, and when I passed people on the street, I would impolitely stare, unblinking, at their faces. I saw a sea of polite urban human suffering. Once I started noticing, it was overwhelming just how many people were shattered.\n\nI\u2019d see them standing in line at the grocery store, glazed eyes staring politely into space, and my nose would fill with the heavy smell of loss. Someone\u2019s mother just died. Someone just got evicted. Someone just got sued for something they didn\u2019t do. Someone is so overwhelmed by the news cycle that they can\u2019t sleep through the nightmares of political demagogues and images of polar bears swimming through melting Arctic oceans. Someone is on the brink of losing their job and knows it.\n\nSeattle is a prosperous city in a first-world country, and globally speaking, we\u2019re a privileged lot. We don\u2019t live in a war zone and so many of our lives are relatively good. But once I better understood just how pain scars people\u2019s faces, I could see everyone\u2019s cheeks pockmarked with it.\n\nI decided I would take on a new side project: I would compliment people on the street as much as I possibly could.\n\nThe reality is that when you take the two seconds to notice something (that\u2019s all you\u2019re really doing) and then speak it with a smile, you usually get a smile in return. A smile! You just made someone feel seen and appreciated. It\u2019s such a simple, mundane thing to take an interest in the people around you and show them appreciation. It\u2019s a gratitude practice on a neighborhood level.\n\nI felt ridiculous when I first started doing it, but those days were so gray and colorless and devoid of pleasure that I\u2019d take any quick hit I could get of not-pain.\n\nLet\u2019s pause to remember how many of the sensations of a life crisis are influenced by the chemicals in your body. The short-term stress-release chemicals, serotonin and oxytocin, have a relative called cortisol that the body relies on when our stress is longer-lasting \u2013 like when you\u2019re dealing with an existential implosion.\n\nSeven things I wish I'd known before my divorce: an optimistic guide to the future Read more\n\nCortisol is the body\u2019s stress hormone, and it\u2019s produced in the adrenal gland. It regulates sleep, energy, blood pressure, and how your body processes carbs, proteins, and fats. Cortisol is an important tool our bodies use when we\u2019re in the thick of it, but if it stays around too long, it can exacerbate your challenges.\n\nReducing levels of cortisol overproduction involves reducing stress in your life. The most effective ways to reduce cortisol overproduction include basics like regulating sleep, getting habitual about relaxation (stretching, breathing exercises), and regular moderate exercise.\n\nBut I went for a different strategy: complimenting people.\n\nGetting a solid ROI on your compliments\n\nI tried to start small.\n\n\u201cLove those boots,\u201d I told a lady at the bus stop, and she gave a politely tight grimace.\n\nHuh, I thought. That was a low return on investment on that particular compliment, but it still felt nice there for a moment. If a polite grimace gave me a six on the 1\u201310 warmheartedness meter, then maybe I could feel better if I could compliment better.\n\nI knew that complimenting someone\u2019s physical appearance was low-hanging fruit \u2013people don\u2019t necessarily have a sense of ownership over whatever aspect you\u2019re complimenting them on. Your friend with the gorgeous eyes might feel a bit squirmy when you gush about them because, really, it\u2019s just about genetics: thanks, but whatever.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll get a better ROI from complimenting them on the choice they actively made in selecting a top in that shade because it brings out their eyes. Your friend feels like you\u2019ve noticed something more specific, and you\u2019re complimenting their decisions \u2013 not just their genes.\n\nI learned that these genuine compliments had a way better ROI. It was easy enough to practice. I worked my way up from complimenting shoes, slowly getting up to complimenting necklaces and people\u2019s hair. As I got bolder, I added campy hand gestures to my compliment repertoire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m loving everything that\u2019s happening here,\u201d I said, walking past a fabulously non-binary person in a body-conscious gold jumpsuit and coordinated vest. I splayed my fingers and waved my arm like a grand old dame, from sky to sidewalk. \u201cEverything!\u201d I crowed over my shoulder, speed-walking on in my orthopedic Adidas high tops. Grand old dame likes everything that\u2019s happening here, people! Everything! I barely looked back to see what the reaction was, but I\u2019m pretty sure I at least got a smile.\n\nI got more creative and enthusiastic as time went on. And you know what? The more I did that, the more joy got bounced back. It was thrilling. It was also truly terrifying for a Seattleite. It was vulnerable and brazen at the same time. Making eye contact and speaking to a stranger, out here on the passive streets of Seattle?! Unheard of! I loved it.\n\nComplimenting others is self-serving (and that\u2019s OK)\n\nWalking down the street on my way to dinner with a friend, I pointed at a woman\u2019s earrings as she walked by. They were enormous raw-brass hoops, and they glowed against her dark skin.\n\n\u201cThose earrings are beyond phenomenal,\u201d I called out to her, not slowing down as we passed each other.\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d she shouted over her shoulder back at me, laughing. There was no need to get into a whole conversation or take time out of anyone\u2019s day \u2013 you can just drop a quick compliment and keep on moving!\n\n\u201cWhy bother doing that when you\u2019ll never see her again?\u201d my friend asked. \u201cWhat motivates making the effort?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about her,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s partially a selfish act. I mean, if you\u2019re doing it right, complimenting someone makes two people happy \u2013 them and me. Complimenting her earrings took me two seconds and made me feel warm and fuzzy for a minute. And those brass hoops were great. Now I want some brass hoops \u2026\u201d\n\nRaj Raghunathan PhD, author of If You\u2019re So Smart, Why Aren\u2019t You Happy?, explained that one of the reasons complimenting others makes you feel better is that it helps you perceive yourself as a generous, bighearted person, which in turn increases your self-esteem.\n\nIn contrast, tearing people down with criticism or snark might make you feel superior in the short term, but Raghunathan says that negging others makes you view yourself poorly. These \u201cdownward comparisons\u201d have an echo-chamber effect, in that they make others feel negative, which can lead them to criticize you.\n\nThis then can lead to you being more likely to attract critical, unforgiving people. That\u2019s the last thing you need.\n\nBut complimenting others isn\u2019t a completely selfish act. Dr Alex Lickerman, co-author of The Ten Worlds: The New Psychology of Happiness, tried smiling at and positively engaging with service workers he saw regularly, and discovered that their demeanor seemed to change overall. He observed that workers who\u2019d been reserved or even sullen began to engage more positively and happily with other customers (although Lickerman noted that there was an initial period of feeling like he was weirding out service workers when he was friendly with them).\n\nPeople who receive compliments are also more likely to give them, just like those who receive criticism are more likely to be critical. So you can think of your compliments as a way of paying it forward and spreading positivity beyond yourself.\n\nFinally, I felt I could directly transfer a small bit of support to a fellow human. It was a tiny transfer, but if I could just do it enough times, in enough mediums, on enough streets, in enough cities, on enough screens, in enough books \u2026 if I could just spread enough bits of support, maybe the bits could add up to something more substantial.\n\nCompliments are a very small daily practice, but it\u2019s a good practice to make you happier.\n\nExcerpted from the book From Sh!tshow To Afterglow, by Ariel Meadow Stallings, out now", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/22/coronavirus-strangers-compliments-street-seattle", "author": ["Ariel Meadow Stallings"]}, {"title": "Before a vaccine, we'll need treatments.

And while a vaccine like the one being trialled by Oxford University will (hopefully) prevent or lessen the impact of the virus, it will not take away the need for therapies to treat people who become unwell as a consequence of becoming infected.

And treating only a subsection of the world\u2019s population is neither ethical, nor good science.\n\nInfection with Sars-CoV-2 causes a range of health problems, the most common of which is lung inflammation, with resultant difficulty in the transfer of oxygen from the air sacs within the lung (alveoli) to the blood, sometimes referred to as respiratory failure.\n\nOn Monday, Synairgen (a University of Southampton spin-out company) announced that a small clinical trial of inhaled interferon beta-1a has shown this treatment may be effective in patients in hospital with Covid-19. But there have been many similar announcements about therapies for the disease that have subsequently been shown to be underwhelming: is this one any different?\n\nInterferon beta-1a is a substance that the body produces naturally as part of its immune response to viral infections. Laboratory data suggesting that interferon beta may help to protect cells, such as those in the lungs, from other coronavirus infections (such as Mers and Sars) led to interest in whether it might be an effective therapy for Sars-CoV-2 infection. Synairgen had previously developed an inhaled form of interferon beta-1a as a therapy for patients with asthma and chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD), so it was well placed to undertake a clinical trial in patients with Covid-19.\n\nThe results announced on Monday are from a study that recruited approximately 100 patients from nine hospitals in the UK, and aimed to determine whether the therapy was well tolerated, and if it could prevent or accelerate recovery from respiratory infection caused by Sars-CoV-2. All of the patients recruited into the trial had tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 and were in hospital. The press release claims that the odds of patients clinically deteriorating to the extent they required mechanical ventilation or died was reduced by 79%. Synairgen also claims that patients who received the therapy were more likely to recover over the 14-day treatment period than those who did not.\n\nHave we really found the therapy we have been looking for? Maybe. Maybe not. This clinical trial is small (about 50 patients received the therapy and about 50 patients received the placebo). It was designed to see whether the therapy was tolerated by the patients, and whether it might be effective. So far, we only have a press release suggesting these things may have happened \u2013 what we need to see is the actual research data. The claim of a 79% reduction in the risk of needing mechanical ventilation or dying sounds brilliant. I am an intensive care specialist who knows only too well how great the need for a therapy like this is; according to the latest data from the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre, more than 7,000 people admitted to UK intensive care units have needed mechanical ventilation, and more than 4,000 people have died. However, we need to remember that only about 50 people received this therapy, and while the press release tells us that three people (6%) who received the placebo died, it does not tell us the number of people who required mechanical ventilation. So we cannot tell how meaningful the effect of this drug is, but the reality is likely to be less striking than the impression given by that \u201c79%\u201d.\n\nAre the British conformist or libertarian? Our face mask response is telling | Richard Coker Read more\n\nIf the full research dataset, when it is published, looks good, interferon beta-1a therapy should subsequently be tested in large randomised controlled clinical trials. I am sure there will be people suggesting the therapy should be immediately rushed into routine clinical practice without further testing, but we need to be cautious. There are many examples of therapies that seemed promising in early-phase clinical trials that when tested in larger studies showed no benefit, or even harm.\n\nWhile I sound a note of caution there is also cause for celebration. This research trial was yet another achievement delivered through the clinical trial infrastructure developed by the National Institute for Health Research that has been so successful during the pandemic. The NIHR has enabled the UK to make world-leading advances in treatments for Covid-19. For example, the Recovery trial has already shown that dexamethasone works for patients in hospital who need oxygen or mechanical ventilation, and that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir don\u2019t. In addition, the NIHR is supporting a raft of early- and late-phase clinical trials testing other therapies, all alongside delivering multiple vaccine trials.\n\nCovid-19 has led to the NIHR demonstrating that it can deliver healthcare research at a scale and speed unmatched anywhere else in the world, and that is definitely something to be pleased about.\n\n\u2022 Dr Charlotte Summers is a lecturer in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/21/vaccine-treatements-interferon-beta-1a-therapy", "author": ["Charlotte Summers"]}, {"title": "Shaming people who refuse to wear face masks isn\u2019t a good look | Arwa Mahdawi", "text": "Costco Karen; Walmart Karen; Starbucks Karen; Target Karen. Name a US retail establishment and there\u2019s probably a viral video of a \u201cKaren\u201d (internet slang for an angry white woman) fuming about face masks in it or getting chased out of the store for refusing to wear one. \u201cMask meltdown\u201d videos have become a feature of the pandemic, part of a larger trend of mask-shaming. Sneering at people who refuse to wear face coverings has become a particularly viral form of virtue signalling.\n\nBritain is a few months behind parts of the US in terms of masks. In New York, where I live, they\u2019ve been compulsory in most public places since April. But with face coverings becoming mandatory for English shoppers this week (and already compulsory in Scotland) I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be long before mask-shaming is as rampant in the UK as it is over here.\n\nYes, people who refuse to wear face masks are selfish. Yes, they\u2019re putting lives in danger. But do they deserve to be vilified and publicly shamed? I don\u2019t think so. Not just because public shaming is often ineffective but because they\u2019re not the biggest villains here: the people who truly deserve our anger are the public figures and authorities \u2013 everyone from the US\u2019s surgeon general to representatives of the World Health Organization \u2013 who, until fairly recently, told us that masks were useless if not dangerous, before doing a U-turn and insisting we all wear one.\n\nThe most generous assessment of the rapidly changing guidelines around mask wearing is that experts have adapted their views as new evidence emerges. But there\u2019s also plenty of evidence that experts have simply lied to us. The French doctor and TV personality Marina Carr\u00e8re d\u2019Encausse has said that her government\u2019s early insistence that masks weren\u2019t necessary was a \u201clie\u201d told \u201cfor a good cause\u201d to ensure health workers wouldn\u2019t run out. In the US, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the same thing. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, just says whatever he reckons will play best at that particular moment. It still boggles my mind that he blithely dismissed masks as just \u201cextra insurance\u201d on a Monday and then announced the next day that they would be mandatory in shops and enforced with fines. And you wonder why people don\u2019t trust experts or the government? Aggggg! Hear that? It\u2019s the muffled sound of me screaming into the void through my face mask.\n\n\u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/22/shaming-people-who-refuse-to-wear-face-masks-isnt-a-good-look", "author": ["Arwa Mahdawi"]}, {"title": "Lockdown has made it easier to talk about how difficult love can be | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett", "text": "In the weeks running up to my wedding, three years ago, I often found myself asking: what is the secret to a successful marriage? I did this, perhaps impertinently, even with strangers; and it was a stranger, on the Northern line, who gave me the answer that has stayed with me the longest: \u201cTolerance.\u201d The friend I was with confessed afterwards that she had found this rather unromantic, but what the much older gentleman and his wife (who looked to be in their late 80s or early 90s) had said resonated with me. To tolerate is not to be a doormat, but to accept that the other person may not have the same outlook that you do, and that your behaviour and opinions may diverge. It is to be magnanimous, rather than seek to punish independence of thought.\n\nThere are people who have not touched another person for many months\n\nTolerance is difficult to practise at the best of times, but in lockdown it is even more of a challenge. Overnight, external support structures were stripped away, and many couples thrown into one another\u2019s pockets. There have been reports of a global \u201cdivorce boom\u201d following lockdown, and it is easy to understand why. During moments of crisis, we tend to take stock. Add confinement to the mix, and tensions have the potential to rise. Small arguments escalate and become proxy wars for bigger, unresolved problems. Many unhappy couples will have decided that they simply can\u2019t bear it any longer.\n\nFor many younger couples, the pandemic will have represented their first major relationship challenge. According to the UK relationship support service Relate, more than a third of people aged 16 to 34 have struggled to emotionally support their partner through lockdown. I\u2019m almost surprised it isn\u2019t more. Lockdown was such a singular, aberrant scenario, a strange and emotionally exhausting rollercoaster. That two-thirds of younger couples feel they have done a good job of supporting each other is encouraging.\n\nWhen you enter a long-term relationship, you know the potential eventualities: that you may face the challenge of parenthood together, that you will both lose loved ones, that financial hardships may come to pass. You know that there may be crying in the night. You know, unless you are very young, that you may end up caring for the other person into old age. But this was not something anyone predicted. I wonder how many relationships received a baptism of fire because of the pandemic.\n\nThe psychotherapist Esther Perel has been producing podcasts, webinars and newsletters throughout lockdown about the challenges it presents. In her newsletter earlier this year, she emphasised the importance of recognising that we all have different coping mechanisms. \u201cUnder acute stress, some of us become highly logical, others become highly emotional,\u201d she wrote. In other words, we need to tolerate our differences in an emergency situation, too.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been single through lockdown, this might all sound like whingeing. There are people who have not touched another person for many months, and that absence of human touch has real, profound emotional effects (this absence can, of course, exist in relationships too). At the same time, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that relationships are hard. The lure of the fairytale is powerful, and has been amplified by influencer culture on social media. When it comes to celebrities, we see the romantic weddings and then the catastrophic relationship breakdowns, but far less space is devoted to the everyday challenges that couples face. Perhaps that\u2019s why a video of the actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith discussing the time their marriage nearly ended resonated so much online recently. Even if it did feel a tad choreographed, the honesty of the conversation and the visible emotion on display felt new.\n\nThe psychological toll of coronavirus in Britain \u2013 a visual guide Read more\n\nAttitudes also seem to be changing among the non-famous. Not long ago, I worked on a piece about younger couples who had been to relationship therapy. I was encouraged by how open my interviewees were about having sought help. They still carried a slight stigma about seeking therapy, but far less than that our parents\u2019 generation faced, for whom, one interviewee noted, marriage counselling was seen as a last-ditch attempt to save a failing relationship, and any problems were kept from the children. This new culture of openness about the lows as well as the highs can only be a good thing.\n\nWe are yet to see the effects of lockdown on relationships in the long term, but it won\u2019t all be divorce and heartbreak. There have been new relationships and pregnancy announcements and marriage proposals. Some couples, free of the distractions of children and grandchildren, will have reconnected. I wonder how many people, faced with the genuine threat of a terrible disease, confessed their love to each other. How many others have come through a strange and frightening time loving their partner more than ever, certain they made the right choice?\n\nIt\u2019s become a cliche to speak of \u201clove in the time of corona(virus)\u201d, an overused headline riffing off the Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez novel. Love in the Time of Cholera is a book I adored as a moony-eyed teenager, before I understood that love came with its challenges, even though it was plain to see in the novelist\u2019s words: \u201cTogether they had overcome the daily incomprehension, the instantaneous hatred, the reciprocal nastiness, and fabulous flashes of glory in the conjugal conspiracy,\u201d M\u00e1rquez writes. \u201cIt was the time when they both loved each other best, without hurry or excess, when both were most conscious of and grateful for their incredible victories over adversity. Life would still present them with other moral trials, of course, but that no longer mattered: they were on the other shore.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is Guardian columnist", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/22/lockdown-love-romatic-relationships-coronavirus", "author": ["Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett"]}, {"title": "Universities are vital to the post-pandemic future of Wales. We must protect them", "text": "Think of the world\u2019s oldest universities and the names trip off the tongue: Bologna, Oxford, the Sorbonne. But would Llantwit Major, in Wales, feature on the list?\n\nBack in the 4th century, a Christian college was founded in the Vale of Glamorgan. It was named Cor Tewdws, in honour of Emperor Theodosius. He negotiated peace with the Goths and declared Christianity the official religion of the Roman empire. It is claimed that there was 2,000 students at a time, but as a coastal college it suffered invasions and destructions from Ireland, Denmark, France and England.\n\nThe challenges facing Welsh higher education are now global, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our universities have already done so much to meet the needs of the moment, and will continue to be a critical actor in our recovery through their teaching, research and innovation. But we know they could face significant financial challenges, particularly due to uncertainty over future student numbers.\n\nMoving forwards together is critical to the national mission of education reform, which I have led since coming into office as Welsh minister for education.\n\nA national mission doesn\u2019t mean that all colleges and universities should be identikit. Instead, I want to encourage them to be more specialised, recognising that they all contribute in different ways. I welcome our sector\u2019s renewed ambition for widening access and increasing diversity in research, innovation and the professions.\n\nThis is why today I have confirmed an additional allocation of \u00a350m for Welsh universities and colleges in priority areas of supporting students, teaching and research. I will consider their needs again in the autumn, within the wider context of ensuring our resources support our economic and social recovery.\n\nIn my view, the purpose of education is not simply to get a job. It is about becoming an informed and engaged citizen. Education equips people for their careers and lives, which in turn benefits our society, democracy and economy.\n\nThese benefits still do not reach enough of the population. Therefore, the background of individuals and groups that go on to further and higher education continues to matter to me and to the Welsh government. It remains unfinished business.\n\nThere is still work to do to ensure more people of all ages from disadvantaged backgrounds get a degree and postgraduate education. Wales is the only European nation where all university students receive equivalent living cost support in the form of grants and loans. Since that change the number of Welsh-domiciled postgrads has increased by 26%. I do not want to lose this momentum \u2013 it is essential for social mobility.\n\nMuch of universities\u2019 social mobility work \u2013 partnerships with schools, widening access, research and innovation \u2013 represents the best of Welsh universities\u2019 civic mission. However, we can still do more. Our draft Tertiary Education and Research Bill, published last week, will create a more joined up further and higher education system.\n\nWorking together, I would like to see a new national civic mission framework to ensure that working with local communities is part of the DNA of each university. We need to see local communities even more involved in university governance and decision-making, with more institutions and academics sharing widely the knowledge, understanding and innovation they produce.\n\nWales has a good story to tell when it comes to higher education. However, we must be better at measuring and monitoring, so that it is understood by students, citizens, the nation and the world.\n\nThe story of Cor Tewdws might not be well known, but I think we can draw on some of that spirit now. Theodosius ended up being the last leader of a unified Roman empire. As we come through the pandemic and face Brexit, we are facing a similar historic change. Our universities are essential to safeguarding and enhancing the prosperity and social fabric of Wales now and into the future.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jul/22/universities-are-vital-to-the-post-pandemic-future-of-wales-we-must-protect-them", "author": []}, {"title": "Fiona the Precariously Employed Bettong: I can almost get by on jobseeker.

Masks provide an extra layer of protection against viral transmission; until a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available, anything that even minimally reduces transmission \u2013 from hand-washing to mask-wearing to avoiding bars (for now) \u2013 can save lives.\n\nThere have been more than 3.5m confirmed Covid-19 cases in the United States this year, with a record daily high of 74,000 new cases confirmed last week. Given the seriousness of the disease \u2013 we now know asymptomatic people transmit Covid-19, and emerging research shows that even mild cases can have an outsized impact on a person\u2019s health, potentially causing strokes and serious brain disorders - many Americans, like people all over the world, now wear masks as a simple precaution against transmitting the virus when outside the home.\n\nA Gallup poll of 2,451 American adults taken this April found that one-third always wears a mask outside their homes, with another third reporting they wear a mask sometimes.\n\nThat means most Americans are willing to do a small thing they understand contributes to the safety of their communities. Yet it leaves the one-third of respondents who reported never wearing masks. What\u2019s going on with them?\n\nThere\u2019s no one answer to the question of why certain people do not partake in what many others see as a civic duty, or simply a sensible way to behave. Some may have extenuating health conditions that preclude their ability to safely wear a mask. For others, the deliberate choice not to wear a mask has become a way to signal their personal worldviews, ideologies and partisan affiliations.\n\nThe Gallup poll also revealed that US mask-wearers and anti-maskers are largely divided along party lines, with 75% of Democrats but fewer than half of Republicans saying they had worn a mask in public. One factor contributing to this difference in approach could be that the pandemic has, thus far, hit coastal, Democratic-leaning America the hardest. Republicans, on the other hand, are more likely to be living in counties where the economy has been affected more than public health.\n\nIn April, Donald Trump undermined the CDC\u2019s recommendation that the public wear masks, saying he was 'choosing not to do it'\n\nThe idea that wearing a mask signals submissive weakness or a forfeiture of individual freedoms has also gained currency with some anti-maskers. Their skepticism may be linked to everything from disapproval that the CDC and Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s stance on masks changed as the pandemic developed (initially, PPE was only recommended for healthcare workers), to resentment that certain regions and businesses are enforcing pro-mask policies that infringe, however infinitesimally, on individual liberty. There are also QAnon conspiracy boards where users theorize that Covid-19 is itself a hoax. Then there\u2019s the behavior of rightwing political pundits and the president himself, who have often cast doubt on Covid-19\u2019s importance.\n\nIn May, RR Reno, the editor of the conservative religious journal First Things, ranted on Twitter that \u201cThe mask culture [is] fear-driven,\u201d bizarrely claiming soldiers fighting in the second world war were \u201cnot cowards\u201d because they did not wear masks (they did). In April, Donald Trump undermined the CDC\u2019s recommendation that the public wear masks, saying he was \u201cchoosing not to do it\u201d, contributing to the perception that masksappear weak. During Trump\u2019s visit to an Arizona Honeywell mask-manufacturing plant in May, reporter BrieAnna Frank noted that supporters who gathered outside the facility to cheer on the president also derided mask-wearing journalists. Afterwards, on Twitter, Frank recounted what one man said: \u201cIt\u2019s submission, it\u2019s muzzling yourself, it looks weak, especially for men.\u201d Indeed, research substantiates that some men do not feel secure in their masculinity when wearing masks, choosing to prioritize fragile ego over human life.\n\nAs the New York Times\u2019 Amanda Hess observed, to those who express their support for the president by refusing to wear a mask, anyone who does wear one isn\u2019t just being cautious \u2013 \u201cthey\u2019re attacking the president and his supporters.\u201d To illustrate this tension, Hess described a sign on the door of a Texas restaurant banning masks: \u201cDue to our concern for our customers, if they FEEL (not think), that they need to wear a mask, they should stay home until they FEEL that it\u2019s safe to be in public without one,\u201d it read.\n\nIndeed, some anti-maskers claim to not only be concerned about the bad optics of taking a simple precaution during a terrible crisis; they also question the science behind mask-wearing despite the many scientific studies that have now proven beyond a doubt that masks do help reduce the chance of person-to-person viral transmission. In addition to being misleading, \u201cscientific\u201d anti-mask arguments are hard to take seriously given how transparently they have become a tool of post-hoc rationalization for what was always going to be the immediate position of a certain subset of conservative America anyway \u2013 that the economy supersedes all.\n\nMore optimistically, last week also marked the first time Trump wore a mask in public \u2013 an event which could encourage America\u2019s more extreme mask-skeptics to also don face coverings where appropriate or required. If so, they will have waited for millions to sicken before ceasing to pretend that masks equate oppression, and finally acting to protect themselves and their country.

Neither the British government nor intelligence agencies made any effort to investigate the alleged hacking of the UK\u2019s most significant democratic event in generations.\n\nRussia report reveals UK government failed to investigate Kremlin interference Read more\n\nThe intelligence and security committee\u2019s (ISC) Russia report does not hold back. It states that \u201cwe have not been provided with any post-referendum assessment of Russian attempts at interference ... in stark contrast to the US handling of allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election\u201d. Its press release is even more blunt, declaring that \u201cthe government did not take action to protect the UK\u2019s process in 2016\u201d. The committee duly recommends that the intelligence services \u201cproduce an analogous assessment of potential Russian interference in the EU referendum\u201d and publish an unclassified summary.\n\nPredictably, the government has rejected that advice. It has responded that \u201cwe have seen no evidence of successful interference in the EU referendum\u201d, and given the lack of new information, \u201ca retrospective assessment ... is not necessary\u201d.\n\nWe should note that many Russia experts doubt a coordinated interference in the Brexit referendum. Some argue that it vastly overestimates, and indeed flatters, Russian power, casting Vladimir Putin as an omnipotent and organised super-villain, rather than the frequently stymied leader of a chaotic state bureaucracy. Many also note that Russia had both economic and political interests to maintain a strong EU \u2013 not least as a bulwark against the US. Much of the consensus suggests that interference was probably low-level and uncoordinated \u2013 a moderate nuisance rather than a major attack.\n\nNevertheless, allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 EU referendum did not emerge from the ether and were not simply the online ramblings of conspiracy theorists. As the report notes, there is credible evidence that Russian actors have interfered in foreign elections over a period of some years, and the Russian state often views foreign policy as a zero-sum game.\n\nThe prospect of Russian interference should therefore have been taken seriously, not dismissed as partisan theatre. As one expert put it to me, \u201cthe best way to counter Russia\u2019s influence is to expose it, transparently, without political games\u201d. A government that valued the integrity of its elections and institutions would make every conceivable effort to investigate and combat breaches. This government\u2019s entire approach to the Russia report suggests that it instead privileged its own short-term interests.\n\nWhy has the government looked the other way? Frankly, it has simply been consistent. The referendum was compromised in a number of ways. Some, such as the allegations of misspending, were about laws. Others, such as the naked falsehoods published by Vote Leave, were about basic fairness. And yet early on, for whatever reason, the UK government decided that Brexit was the will of the people and that was the end of it. Under the stewardship of Theresa May, the referendum transformed from political moment to religious text. Brexit became our national creed and would not be questioned.\n\nThis approach has infected our body politic. As the ISC noted, MI5 has been anxious not to be seen as involving itself in \u201ccontentious\u201d politics. Really this reveals the hyper-tribal nature of our modern political landscape. Nothing is, or is seen to be, neutral. Even well-meaning attempts at objectivity are slammed as political point-scoring. But to investigate the workings of the referendum is not to take sides in a political dispute, but to ensure the proper functioning of our democracy. That cannot rely on winning by any means necessary, and no democratic engine can survive without occasionally lifting the bonnet. A British government should not simply want to confirm the legitimacy of our elections. It explicitly needs to.\n\nThe fundamental point here is not that we would have remained in the EU if it hadn\u2019t been for shady officials in Moscow, or troll farms in St Petersburg. Even if such a smoking gun exists, it will probably never be found. Rather, the government had reason to suspect a violation of our democratic processes and ignored it. An admission of such a breach would have caused embarrassment. It could have made life even more difficult on the global stage. Worst of all, it would have demanded greater justification for the national self-sabotage our government has resolved, at any cost, to implement.\n\nThe scandal revealed today, then, is not that our democracy was corrupted or voided by the actions of a foreign power \u2013 it\u2019s that the British establishment didn\u2019t care either way.\n\n\u2022 Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/21/russian-meddling-brexit-referendum-tories-russia-report-government", "author": ["Jonathan Lis", "Marina Hyde"]}, {"title": "The Russia report had one big revelation: how little Britain really wants to know | Marina Hyde", "text": "Today\u2019s publication of the long-delayed Russia report reveals grotesque incuriosity. \u201cThe outrage isn\u2019t that there was interference,\u201d explained intelligence and security committee member Kevan Jones of suggestions the Brexit vote may have been compromised. \u201cThe outrage is that no one [in government] would want to know if there was interference.\u201d Far from providing answers, the report\u2019s main revelation is that the successive Conservative governments and the intelligence agencies seem to have regarded the most serious matters as analogous to the deaths of Spinal Tap drummers: best left unsolved.\n\nSo on the one hand the Russia report has spoiled the haute remainer prom by failing to contain all the knockout blows some of the movement\u2019s leading lights have long been implying it contains.

With the exception of those with something to hide \u2013 or to lose \u2013 most would surely agree it\u2019s quite clear that Russia has sought to influence the results of elections, both here and in other nation states. At one level it\u2019s already such an axiomatic part of modern life that it feels like attempting to establish the pope\u2019s religion, or whether the bears\u2019 claim to journey into town to use the public conveniences really stands up to much scrutiny.\n\nRussia brings down passenger planes and lies about it; it uses nerve agent to poison UK citizens in our historic market towns, then sends the would-be assassins on TV to give deadpan interviews about spire heights. The Russian state\u2019s troll farms and high-level hacks are well documented, as is the Russian state\u2019s hack and leak on the US Democratic party. London, meanwhile, is awash with sensationally questionable Russian money and people who service it, including those in the House of Lords. And it\u2019s regarded as totally normal for the ruling party to raise funds for itself by whoring out the prime minister and other senior lawmakers for \u00a3160,000 tennis games with wives of former Russian ministers. Otherwise irrelevant businessmen whose sole claim to fame is funding part of the Brexit vote imagine they\u2019re \u201cmates\u201d with the Russian ambassador. According to reports, the Russian state recently attempted to perform some kind of Covid vaccine-jacking from Oxford University\u2019s labs.\n\nHistorically, meanwhile, the British state has always had more whitewash than the deepest whitewash-mining concession in the Urals. Presumably this is why the intelligence services didn\u2019t even bother looking for evidence of electoral interference.\n\nSo yes, you don\u2019t particularly need to put a smoking gun to my head to get me to say: I think we pretty much know Russia tries to influence UK affairs, including elections. They\u2019re still best at their own, of course \u2013 Putin just notched up another landslide in a referendum that will allow him to stay in power until 2036.\n\nHaving said all that \u2026 a word on \u201cthe dead cat\u201d, an increasingly hard-to-kill phrase. This political term of art was beloved by election strategist Lynton Crosby, and denoted the practice of distracting from an unhelpful story with something too eye-catching to ignore. But it was \u2013 as far as I can see \u2013 most popularised after a very appealing little explainer on it back in 2015 by the Spectator\u2019s Isabel Hardman. That was when it caught the imagination of some nascent political obsessives, and over the past few years the dead cat has taken on a life of its own. It seems to have 9,000 lives. It is produced daily by people who understand everything better than you.\n\nAnd yet, do they? \u201cDead cat\u201d is certainly meant to be one of those terms designed to show the user has an arch familiarity with politics as it is, not as it should be. Alas, it is such a sledgehammer signifier that it reminds me of a hilarious Clive James review of the Judith Krantz bonkbuster Princess Daisy, where he remarks upon the author\u2019s endless heavy-handed allusions to the trappings of wealth. \u201cMrs Krantz would probably hate to hear it said,\u201d he observes of one breathless passage on the gold bordering of the menus at the Connaught hotel, \u201cbut she gives the impression of having been included late amongst the exclusiveness she so admires. There is nothing wrong with gusto, but when easy familiarity is what you are trying to convey, gush is to be avoided.\u201d\n\nThrough sheer unconvincing overuse, \u201cdead cat\u201d is now political gush. It is bandied about so incontinently that these days it conveys nothing so much as the gaucheness of the bandier. Above all, it should be treated with deep suspicion as it seeks to flatten complex events into an endless series of binaries in which only idiots are paying attention to the \u201cwrong\u201d side. In fact, two things can be important at the same time. It is extremely important we understand the government\u2019s post-Brexit trade machinations, and it is extremely important that we understand they and their predecessors didn\u2019t want to understand what Russia was up to. Can we please finally give the \u201cdead cat\u201d its last rites?\n\nPretending you know EXACTLY what is going on, all the time, is a form of conspiracist mindset. While distraction is absolutely a major weapon in the arsenal of the majority of politicians, it is neither accurate nor illuminating to reduce virtually all events down to simple \u201cdead cats\u201d \u2013 much less a feline centipede of them. More than being unhelpful, it is itself riven with a dangerous kind of contempt, perhaps of the same type the denouncer thinks they\u2019re denouncing. What is it really born of, bar the sense that you know better, and the sheeple who don\u2019t agree with you are dupes or idiots? In that specific respect, perhaps those dead-catting around are not so different from Putin himself. After all, both are gripped by the deeply superior belief that electorates need to be saved from themselves.\n\n\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/21/russia-report-revelation-britain-state-whitewash", "author": ["Marina Hyde", "Jonathan Lis"]}, {"title": "Sketching a crisis: John Crace on the politics of coronavirus - podcast", "text": "Sketch writer John Crace reflects on a surreal parliamentary session, including the daily indignities of the coronavirus press conferences, which some cabinet members mastered \u2013 and others clearly did not\n\nAs politicians leave Westminster for the summer recess, they can reflect on an extraordinary period in British politics.

He was placed in five days of isolation at Emirates Old Trafford\u2019s on-site hotel, allowed out only for carefully controlled solitary fitness work, and later fined around \u00a315,000 at a disciplinary hearing for his transgression.\n\nHaving come into contact with an unnamed individual during his detour, Archer then needed to get two negative Covid-19 tests before being allowed to return to the playing group. He officially got the green light on Tuesday morning.\n\nWriting in the Daily Mail, Archer has revealed the mental toll of the online criticism combined with his time in isolation, has him concerned he might not be \u201c100 per cent mentally right\u201d in time for the third Test.\n\nHe writes: \u201cThis whole week has been extremely tough and to spend five days in isolation has given me a lot of thinking time on where I am at. I give 100% every time I go out there and I don\u2019t want to go out on the field unless I can guarantee doing that.\u201d\n\nArcher dubbed most of the online criticism he has since received \u201cunnecessary noise\u201d, adding he had unfollowed and muted a lot of social media accounts to distance himself from the negativity. He also said some of the abuse he has received has been racist.\n\n\u201cSome of the abuse I have taken over the past few days on Instagram has been racist and I have decided that enough is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cI have forwarded my complaints to the ECB and that will go through the correct process.\u201d\n\nAn ECB spokesperson said: \u201cThe alleged racist message was brought to our attention by Jofra last week. We are supporting him and we have reported the message through the appropriate channels and authorities.\u201d\n\nThe fast bowler wrote that he had apologised to his teammates and thanked them for their support, while singling out Ben Stokes for advising him on \u201chow to deal with being in the spotlight of international sport\u201d.\n\nHe added that the mixed treatment of Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford, along with the varying reactions between his first and second innings in Southampton, had shown him how \u201cfickle\u201d professional sport can be.\n\nWhile he believes the West Indies series is \u201cthere for the taking\u201d, more than anything, Archer said he just wants to be able to feel like his old self.\n\n\u201cNow I have done my time, it\u2019s over, and I am trying to move on,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI know what I did was an error of judgement and I have suffered the consequences of that. I haven\u2019t committed a crime and I want to start feeling myself again.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/22/jofra-archer-may-miss-third-test-cricket-after-racist-abuse-over-breach-backlash", "author": []}, {"title": "Decision time for Silverwood and Root in England's series of the tinkerman | Vic Marks", "text": "Ben Stokes aside, England have played six pacemen so far and all have a case to play in the final Test against West Indies\n\nAll square with one to play. Somehow the players of both sides have set up an intriguing climax to a series that has surpassed expectations. There have been dull patches of play, just occasionally the standard has dipped, but both Tests have been in the balance on the fifth day and the intensity of the cricket has been a minor triumph.\n\nStokes and Broad lead charge as England beat West Indies to level series Read more\n\nThe upshot is that we have enjoyed a surprisingly compelling spectacle that keeps on giving. In these weird times some have been bingeing on Line of Duty, others on England v West Indies; we are now so much more familiar with Shamarh Brooks and Jermaine Blackwood and they are interesting characters, good to watch; so, too, are Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley, who have similar roles and utterly contrasting techniques and approaches to batting \u2013 and there\u2019s always Ben Stokes for a bit of stardust.\n\nSo the final Test is anticipated eagerly. England have the options, a bewildering number of them, and the impetus. The tired adage of never change a winning side is outmoded in 2020 but after the win on Monday Stokes reassured everyone he was fit \u2013 he pulled up in the middle of an over just before the end of the game as a precaution \u2013 so the likelihood is that Joe Root and Chris Silverwood will have a full complement of eager, healthy bowlers vying for a place on Friday. However, they will want to restrict the number of overs Stokes bowls if he is to play in every Test this summer.\n\nLeaving aside Stokes, England have played six pacemen in two Tests, that is everyone with a realistic chance of playing Test cricket this summer. All have bowled well enough. All have now experienced the vagaries of rotation. All could play on Friday alongside Stokes and a spinner. There are no right answers here, just a mixture of hunches, assessments of the likely conditions as well as the workload charts the experts pore over. And there are only three places. The players, being top sportsmen, will want to play. Silverwood and Root are set to be the Claudio Ranieris of the cricket world for this is the season of the tinkermen.\n\nWhere have all the great Test spinners gone? Take a quick look at T20 | Jonathan Liew Read more\n\nThere is a strong case for the following: retaining Chris Woakes, who was effective with the new ball and the old and the likeliest to find an outside edge against the right-handers. He looks fit and hungry and it may be time for him to shed that understudy tag. They say he only performs well in England and the stats back that up, but where are they playing on Friday?\n\nJofra Archer should also return. This would be tough on Sam Curran, who has been on the winning side in all eight of his home Tests but who would West Indies rather face? England have needed some mid-innings hostility and it was provided by Stokes in the second Test. He should not have to do that all time. The presence of Archer would help here. After his fall from grace and his isolation it would be beneficial to all parties to have Archer back in the fold as soon as possible.\n\nThere then remains the trickiest choice: Broad or Anderson. Perhaps the best option would be to continue with Broad and to play Anderson in the first Test against Pakistan, again at Old Trafford, on 5 August. Broad, especially, has become a new-ball bowler \u2013 even though swing is not a great ally for him now. He is less likely to be effective mid-innings. But the force was with him at crucial times in the second Test.\n\nThe Spin | Internet friends took me from New York to the great Ashes series of 2005 Read more\n\nDom Bess eventually struck when bowling from the right end in West Indies\u2019 second innings. He has improved rapidly, bowling at greater pace and with more zip and he remains a tremendous prospect. But it is surely worth considering rotation in this department, too. Jack Leach is also worthy of a Test place. Why not allow him to become an option?\n\nThere is a tactical reason for change. If West Indies drop the opener John Campbell they will probably have 11 right-handed batsmen. More important, the attack would be better balanced. In the second Test all the pacemen \u2013 except Curran \u2013 wanted to bowl at the James Anderson End. So did Bess for that vital drift in the air towards the off side and he was much more dangerous from there. If conditions are the same for the final Test Leach, being a left-armer, is better suited to bowl at the less-favoured Brian Statham End. Leave Leach for too long and the decision to play him becomes ever riskier.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\nThe options for West Indies are not so obvious but alluring. The prospect of their off-spinner, Rahkeem Cornwall, playing instead of one of the tired pacemen is intriguing and a brave move would have the 22-year-old Joshua Da Silva, not in the official Test squad but a heavy run scorer in West Indies\u2019 practice match before the series, replacing Campbell.

I was called over and kicked on the bone of my shin with a toe-pick of a blade and made to try again. I wasn\u2019t allowed to limp or cry.\n\n\u201cMost of the time such abuse happened in front of other skaters in the rink. I didn\u2019t tell any of my friends, adults at school or my federation, because I was incredibly humiliated. I was made to feel so small. It was dehumanising.\u201d\n\nNow 19, Yu said she decided to speak after watching Athlete A, the Netflix documentary detailing sexual abuse in American gymnastics, and reading claims of widespread abuse in British Gymnastics. On Monday, Human Rights Watch reported that hundreds of child athletes in Japan said they had suffered abuse.\n\nGymnastics coaches being investigated will be banned from Team GB, says BOA Read more\n\nYu spoke of feeling able to open up because while she had grown up in China and has a Chinese mother, she competed internationally for Singapore, the country of her father\u2019s birth.\n\nThe question of whether China pushes athletes beyond acceptable limits has been raised several times, including by Matthew Pinsent, who said he was shocked at the abuse of young gymnasts on a visit before the 2008 Beijing Olympics. However, it is highly unusual for an athlete who has trained in the country to speak out.\n\nWhen Pinsent made his remarks, the IOC said it was inappropriate to comment. Yu said she hoped that with Beijing hosting the Winter Olympics in just over 18 months\u2019 time, the IOC would recognise it had a unique opportunity to use its influence. \u201cIn gymnastics and skating classes young children have to put their legs on two stools as a coach applies pressure to stretch them,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn my classes, every single person would be sobbing by the end. With one instructor if we cried too much they would add 10 more seconds. I remember thinking this didn\u2019t feel right at all \u2013 and that something might tear.\u201d\n\nAthlete A review \u2013 the scandal that rocked the sporting world Read more\n\nYu said young Chinese athletes were abused when she coached recently at a prominent training centre in Beijing. \u201cI saw one junior skater get hit and dragged off the ice, while another was pressured into competing on two torn ligaments, which left them needing surgery afterwards.\n\n\u201cIt really hurts me to know that this abuse is still happening. Many athletes and coaches believe that such behaviour is necessary and normal in China. It is also hard for Chinese athletes to speak out. They could lose their spot and their careers could end. But as a Singaporean athlete who trained in China, I feel I am in a unique position.\u201d\n\nYu urged the IOC to recognise that young and vulnerable girls in aesthetic sports are particularly at risk. She called for it to set up a dedicated hotline staffed by child protection experts for abuse cases and to use more of its resources to better enforce its 2016 consensus statement that states \u201call athletes have a right to be treated with respect, protected from non-accidental violence\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cThere is a toxicity that plagues aesthetic sports like gymnastics and figure skating, which both have environments in which adults can easily exploit young girls with big dreams. I genuinely believe there\u2019s a correlation between the two sports. In both cases we are judged on our appearances. The costume, the makeup, the body image.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s emphasis on presentation and perfectionism, you\u2019re taught to care about how others perceive you, especially by judges who have power over your scores. So subconsciously you know that speaking out about being hit would ruin this perfectionism.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nIn the past week Yu has contacted the Singapore Ice Skating Association and Singapore Safe Sport to detail her experiences and said she was determined to help protect the next generation of young athletes. \u201cThere was a point in my life when the abuse made me hate the sport,\u201d she said. \u201cI dreaded going to practice, wished for car accidents and sobbed through entire training sessions. But I know now that what I hated wasn\u2019t skating, it was the cruelty. Young athletes should be able to love their sport without going through what I and so many others have.\u201d\n\nThe IOC insisted the safety and wellbeing of athletes was a priority. \u201cHarassment and abuse is unfortunately part of society and also occurs within sport,\u201d it said. \u201cThe IOC stands together with all athletes, everywhere, to state that abuse of any kind is contrary to the values of Olympism, which calls for respect for everyone in sport.\n\n\u201cThe IOC safeguarding team is in regular contact with national Olympic committees, to offer advice and support, including highlighting the available IOC initiatives \u2013 such as the IOC athlete safeguarding toolkit; safe sport educational tools and materials, and initiatives to protect athletes at the Olympic Games and Youth Olympic Games.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/21/dehumanising-jessica-shuran-yu-condemns-training-abuse-in-china-figure-skating", "author": ["Sean Ingle"]}, {"title": "Expect a fan-friendly experience at next year's Rugby League World Cup", "text": "With six of next season\u2019s Premier League stadiums hosting games, no one can accuse Rugby League World Cup 2021 of not aiming high. If it all goes to plan, this should be the biggest and best tournament the sport has ever seen. Within minutes of unveiling the fixture list on Tuesday morning, World Cup wallcharts started dropping through people\u2019s letterboxes 500 days before the three tournaments \u2013 men\u2019s, women\u2019s and wheelchair \u2013 kick off. This level of pre-planning is unheard of in most sports and extraordinary in rugby league.\n\nWith 61 games, 21 teams and 21 venues, there was potential for a scattergun approach, but instead there is order and logic. Hosts England will open at Newcastle on 23 October before heading to Bolton and Sheffield; while Hull, Coventry and St Helens will get to see the world champion Kangaroos. \u201cIt was logistical jigsaw and some teams will have to move around more than others,\u201d said Jon Dutton, the chief executive of the events. \u201cBut each team will live in a basecamp during the week and that will be their home, immersing them in the local community.\u201d\n\nMost of the women\u2019s and wheelchair teams will spend their whole group stage at the same venue (Leeds, York, Sheffield and London\u2019s Copper Box), and nine men\u2019s teams will play two group games in one stadium. While there were few obvious cultural fits between local authorities hosting teams and the various diasporas, Jamaica will be one of three teams who will be at home in Leeds, Newcastle will also become familiar to three teams, St Helens host Tonga (both coached by Kristian Woolf), Leigh will see plenty of Lebanon, and Greece can look forward to the delights of Doncaster.\n\nTha idea worked a trick at the 2013 World Cup, when Scotland were taken to the hearts of the folk of Workington. This time around the Bravehearts will be based in Newcastle, forming part of an opening weekend double-header: England v Samoa on the Saturday at St James\u2019 Park, Scotland v Italy on Sunday at Newcastle Thunder\u2019s Kingston Park.\n\nThe double-header theme runs throughout the three tournaments, with 16 scheduled, and with successive games within 24 hours in the same area on many more occasions, this is the most fan-friendly schedule possible. World Cup tourists will be able to pack in games.\n\nDutton was keen to avoid the mistake made in 2017 when games only took place over the weekend and consequently media coverage sagged badly in midweek. \u201cWe also learned from 2013 that big games work best at weekends, and we want to continue that interest and keep that feeling going through the week. So there are matches on nearly every day.\u201d\n\nWhile the organisers are targeting event-goers for the quarter-final at Anfield, semi-final at Arsenal and the double-header final at Old Trafford, they will also push ticket packages, such as for all three games at St Helens.\n\nBy opening with the first and second seeds in each group meeting, organisers have done all they can to ensure exciting games to kickstart the tournament. \u201cThe rugby union World Cup grappled with one-sided scores, and it was the same in the early stages of the Netball World Cup,\u201d said Dutton. \u201cYes, there will be some, but moving from 14 teams to 16 is a step towards maturity we had to take. Explaining a 14-team tournament to a non-core audience was really hard. Every sports fan understands a 16-team World Cup.\u201d\n\nDutton accepts that the cancellation of the Ashes series (and European Championship) this autumn \u201cmakes the job harder\u201d to reach potential event-goers. \u201cThere\u2019s just not enough international rugby league played and it\u2019s hard not having it to show.\u201d England may arrive at the World Cup having played once in three years.\n\nTony Adams: \u2018Hopefully people have had periods of reflection in lockdown\u2019 Read more\n\nThe draw presents a distinct possibility that England will be the only European team in the quarter-finals. \u201cJamaica against Ireland and then Ireland-Lebanon will be critical games,\u201d said Dutton. \u201cScotland and Wales are in tough groups but if they don\u2019t make it, it won\u2019t damage us in anyway. The athletes will decide who qualifies.\u201d\n\nEvery World Cup seems to have a random venue. In 2000 there were several \u2013 from Reading to Belfast \u2013 and in 2013 it was Bristol. Next year that role goes to Middlesbrough, where the Riverside Stadium\u2019s 35,000 seats will take some filling even for the titanic clash between 2017 semi-finalists Tonga and the Cook Islands. And, after the qualified success of the 2016 Four Nations at Coventry, Australia and Scotland will return to the Ricoh Arena in the only men\u2019s group game being played outside the Northern Powerhouse.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, there will be some midweek afternoon kick-offs, drawing inspiration from the Netball World Cup, which saw school parties pack arenas. What would otherwise have been one of the hardest sells \u2013 Greece v France \u2013 is now taking place during half-term. It will surely be the most fun anyone has had on a Monday afternoon in October in Doncaster.\n\nClubcall: Toronto Wolfpack\n\nThe sudden disappearance of the Wolfpack from this year\u2019s Super League is a culmination of a maelstrom of unfortunate incidents, some of them avoidable. Taken one by one, each could have been dealt with. With hindsight, given the Covid-19 travel restrictions, Super League could have followed Super Rugby\u2019s lead and made 2020 an English-only season, with no relegation. Unable to play at home, with no access to furlough payments in the UK or Canada and no Sky funding, Toronto were in a financial straitjacket from which even the strongest clubs would struggle to escape.\n\nJermaine Coleman: 'Black people don't want a leg up.

It surely won\u2019t do the incoming Ottawa Aces much good either.\n\nForeign quota\n\nChampionship clubs are already clamouring to take Toronto\u2019s place in Super League. Toulouse Olympique should be top of the waiting list. They have the stadium, the team and the potential: and a second French team should bring a TV deal. Following BeIn Sports\u2019 withdrawal, L\u2019\u00c9quipe TV have stepped in to broadcast Catalans\u2019 games in August. They may sign up to take the full Sky package for the rest of the season and film games in Perpignan for Sky.. They could even deem the sport worthy of coverage in the paper again.\n\nGoal-line drop-out\n\nA former rugby league player is designing a laser to use on his own brain. Yes, you read that correctly. Neil Verner, who played for amateur clubs around the Wakefield area, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease four years ago at the age of 48.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s currently very much about palliative care and preparing for the graveyard,\u201d Verner told League Express. \u201cThere was no way I was going to simply resign myself to the situation.\u201d Verner just happens to be a doctor of quantum physics as well as an inventor. \u201cFrom my knowledge of subatomic physics I knew there had to be a solution,\u201d said Verner, who is working on findings from the US to establish trans-cranial laser treatment he can try out on himself. \u201cI know how to cure this \u2013 and I\u2019m going to cure it.\u201d Verner, given the ironic nickname \u2018Nasty\u2019 in his playing days, is aiming to raise \u00a395,000.\n\nFifth and last\n\nMost players would reach 28 and assume their career has peaked. Not Andrew Davey. The Australian second rower was handed his NRL debut last weekend by Parramatta Eels. He had earned it, working his way up through Queensland Cup with Mackay Cutters and Townsville Blackhawks before signing for the Eels last year and impressing in their NSW Cup side, Wentworthville Magpies.

Now, things look grim after the Rams purged future assets in a gamble to win a championship now.\n\nThe Rams\u2019 recent history, and to an extent that of the Seattle Seahawks too, show just how hard it is to build the sustained success that the New England Patriots enjoyed over the last two decades. With that in mind, here are the teams who could dominate the league for years to come.\n\nKansas City Chiefs\n\nRarely has an NFL franchise, certainly not in the modern era, looked so destined for a dynastic run. What could you set as the over/under number of combined Patrick Mahomes MVPs and Chiefs Super Bowls before it becomes absurd? Seven? Ten? Is there a number?\n\nMahomes\u2019 10-year deal, the largest in sports history, is valuable not only because it gives the team the most gifted quarterback in the league for a decade, but because it brings the franchise certainty, a rare commodity in the NFL. Every single thing the Chiefs do between now and 2030 will be centered on how to put the right pieces around Mahomes. And even if they give him the wrong ones, he\u2019s good enough to drag them to success anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s not only Mahomes, though. In general manager Brett Veach, the Chiefs have one of the savviest operators around. And in Andy Reid, they have a head coach who has consistently shown he can grow and adapt as the sport evolves.\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nThe Ravens\u2019 claim to the throne is obvious: Lamar Jackson plus two decades of organizational competence.\n\nThe team\u2019s success with Jackson and the spread-option offense in 2019 was about much more than mere wins and losses. It served as a paradigm shift for the league: BL and AL \u2013 Before and After Lamar. It took the base concepts that have been trickling through the league for years and pushed them to their extremes. Now, it\u2019s not a question of whether a team could or should run a spread-option offense in the NFL. The spread-option is the NFL offense, to varying degrees. The Ravens\u2019 approach differed in style to the kind of option-based offenses we saw in previous years from the 49ers and Colin Kaepernick, Cam Newton and the Panthers, and Robert Griffin III in Washington. As Jackson continues to evolve as a passer, the Ravens will remain a buzzsaw.\n\nPrepare yourself for a decade of Mahomes-Jackson, Chiefs-Ravens matchups to decide the AFC. There have been plenty of false dawns before, but Mahomes-Jackson feels like the real deal successor to the Brady-Manning matchups that dominated the early 2000s.\n\nOne thing that is important to note: offense is traditionally more stable year-to-year than defense. Find a good quarterback, through skill or luck, and your offense will be good. It\u2019s really that simple. A good defense requires 15 talented players and a good scheme, at minimum. Injuries and attrition can sap that in weeks, never mind years.\n\nBuffalo Bills\n\nThe jury is still out on Josh Allen\u2019s worth as an NFL starter. Photograph: Adrian Kraus/AP\n\nThe Bills have an exceptional coach-GM duo. Their roster is uncommonly deep and loaded with young talent. They should be in pole position to claim the AFC East post-Patriots. But their quarterback, Josh Allen, remains a long-term mystery.\n\nAllen\u2019s talent is in the eye-of-the-beholder. Defenders highlight his off-the-cuff brilliance; detractors point to his volatility. A high-variance quarterback leads to a high-variance team, rather than a stretch of reliable success. Key pieces are in place in Buffalo, but the piece, the most significant one of all, may still be missing.\n\nWorst of all, Allen is just tantalizing enough for the team to lock themselves into quarterback purgatory, continually rolling him back for another season (with good reason!) ... and another... and another.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\n\nThere can be a danger with a \u2018who\u2019s next\u2019 list to simply jot down the team\u2019 with the best young quarterbacks, or at least the best quarterbacks on the top value-for-money deals in the NFL.\n\nAnd there\u2019s some truth to that. Only three times has a quarterback occupying more than 12% of a team\u2019s salary cap played in a Super Bowl (Peyton Manning, twice; and Matt Ryan). All three times their team lost. In fact, 75% of quarterbacks who have played in a Super Bowl occupied less than 10% of the cap.\n\nValue wins in the NFL.\n\nIn signing the 38-year-old Philip Rivers to a two-year, $50m deal, the Colts ditched any idea of a youth strategy and plumped for a short championship window based on value.\n\nTaking the gamble was smart. With Jacoby Brissett under center, a team can be competitive, but there is a ceiling. The Colts, rather than tying themselves to a long-term future with a dependable quarterback, took a gamble on Rivers, a veteran-for-hire who could really move the needle.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of smart move we\u2019ve become accustomed to since Chris Ballard started running the organization. The GM\u2019s draft record is exemplary and his knack for grabbing under-the-radar free-agent signings is the kind of skill that keeps a team competitive year after year.\n\nUnder Ballard and Frank Reich, a former quarterback coach and innovative play-caller, the Colts\u2019 principles are obvious: build a sustainable core through the draft; re-invest in homegrown players rather than throw big-money at outside names; find value in the free-agent market; don\u2019t be afraid to pay for bridge quarterback.\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that Andrew Luck retired less than 12 months ago. The team\u2019s franchise star stepping away in what should have been his prime, a fortnight before the beginning of the season, could and probably should have harmed the franchise for at least a year. Competent teams have been sunk by far less. That the Colts had Brissett, a quality backup, in place and the coaching staff had a plan to adjust to the new starter, is a testament to what Ballard and Reich are building in Indianapolis.\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nDallas may have missed their dynastic window, and it\u2019s hard after all the evidence of the past decade to get behind the idea of Mike McCarthy as a multiple Super Bowl champion.\n\nBut then you look at the depth chart. It\u2019s hard to find more talent concentrated on one roster anywhere in the league, and a vast majority of that core is either still in its prime or just about to enter it. The Cowboys should be a year in, year out force. Now, if only they could lock down their quarterback beyond 2020.\n\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/22/chiefs-ravens-and-cowboys-which-franchise-is-the-nfls-next-dynasty", "author": ["Oliver Connolly"]}, {"title": "Our Iranian lockdown: how coronavirus changed one couple\u2019s life", "text": "What term do you want to search?

Read more\n\n\u201cCertainly the subject was discussed,\u201d Bolton, a fierce advocate of testing, told the Guardian. However, there was opposition from some in the administration who felt current computer-based testing of US warheads was sufficient, and no decision was made by the time Bolton left the White House last September.\n\nWhen the prospect of the first US underground nuclear test in nearly three decades came up at a White House meeting in May, it triggered an outcry from arms control advocates and a Democratic amendment to the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, blocking funding for preparations for a test.\n\nBolton, who has published a memoir on his time in the Trump White House titled The Room Where It Happened, said the issue was discussed in general terms on a number of occasions while he was national security adviser from April 2018 to September 2019. However, the discussions did not become \u201coperational\u201d as his priority had been to take the US out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty.\n\nDonald Trump first announced he would leave the agreement \u2013 on the grounds of Russian violations \u2013 in October 2018, and the departure came into effect in August 2019. Bolton made it clear that he planned to withdraw the US signature on the Comprehensive Test Ban treaty (CTBT), paving the way to nuclear testing, if he had stayed on at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe had general discussions about it on a number of occasions but there wasn\u2019t a decision point,\u201d he said. \u201cI personally had other objectives like getting out of the INF treaty. I mean, you can\u2019t do everything all at once.\u201d\n\nA senior official told the Washington Post that the motivation for testing cited in the White House \u201cdeputies meeting\u201d in May was to put pressure on Russia and China to enter trilateral arms control negotiations.\n\n\u201cI never made that argument, and I doubt it would provide much leverage,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nHis argument for underground testing is that it is necessary to be certain of the reliability of the thousands of warheads in the US arsenal.\n\nOpponents of testing say that the computer-based analysis of the \u201cstockpile stewardship and management plan\u201d is quite sufficient, and that detonating a warhead would trigger a cascade of tests by other nuclear weapons states.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know fully what the impact of ageing is on either the reliability or the security and safety of the nuclear devices. So this is something we need for the credibility of the deterrent,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about massive testing. I\u2019m certainly not talking about atmospheric testing, but as one military commander described it to me: \u2018Having 5,000 nuclear warheads is like having 5,000 Toyotas in a garage. You want to know that when you turn the key, it works the first time. Because if it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t work at all.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s new arms control envoy, Marshall Billingslea, told the Senate on Tuesday: \u201cWe maintain and will maintain the ability to conduct nuclear tests if we see reason to do so.\u201d But he added that he was \u201cnot aware of any reason to test at this stage\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump first announced he would leave the INF agreement in October 2018. Photograph: Konstantin Alysh/Russian defence ministry handout/EPA\n\nBolton acknowledged that there was resistance to testing from other officials in the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cI think different people have different views,\u201d he said.\n\nReports of the May meeting also aroused vigorous and bipartisan opposition in Nevada, when the US historically tested its nuclear warheads. Since the last US test in 1992, Las Vegas has expanded considerably and extended much closer to the Nevada test site. Bolton however, argues that local resistance would not be an insuperable obstacle to a resumption of testing..\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of options on the location, and let\u2019s remember these are underground tests that we\u2019re talking about. You\u2019re not not talking about waking up in Las Vegas and feeling the ground move,\u201d he said.\n\nBolton repeated US allegations that the Russians, Chinese \u201cand maybe others\u201d were conducting very low-yield tests in secret, \u201cso some level of testing could simply bring us up to a more level playing field with the other nuclear powers\u201d.\n\nThe US has formally accused Moscow and Beijing of conducting non-zero yield testing, but has not offered any evidence.\n\nI think certainly the potential for external actors, a Gulf country, Israel, working with dissidents inside Iran\n\nBolton was adamant that the US should not extend the 2010 New Start treaty with Russia, which limits the number of deployed strategic warheads and delivery systems of both countries, principally because it does not cover tactical nuclear weapons, of which Russia has many more than the US.\n\nHe supports the Trump administration position that any new round of arms control talks should include China, and suggested other nuclear weapons powers could be involved too.\n\n\u201cI could imagine a strategic arms limitation discussion going forward that has all five permanent members of the [UN] security council, all five legitimate nuclear weapon states under the Non-Proliferation treaty,\u201d Bolton said.\n\nBolton said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d at the string of explosions and fires at Iranian nuclear facilities and other strategic sites in recent weeks, speculating that another Middle Eastern country could be behind the attacks.\n\nIran admits incident at Natanz nuclear site caused major damage Read more\n\n\u201cI think certainly the potential for external actors, a Gulf country, Israel, working with dissidents inside Iran.

More details about the extent of the pay disparity emerged in a memorandum filed in court on Tuesday to classify that lawsuit as class action, which, if approved, would mean it applies to 10,800 women who have been employed by Google at any time since September 2013.\n\nThe women affected encompass a large variety of positions, and more than half are software engineers.\n\nWomen at Google make an average of $2,000 less per year than men on paper, but may be losing out on even more, University of California Irvine distinguished professor of economics David Neumark found in a study cited in the lawsuit. His calculations showed women at Google may be losing out on $17,000 per year because of discriminatory job classifications.\n\nFifth Google worker-activist fired in a month says company is targeting the vulnerable Read more\n\n\u201cGoogle has a pattern and practice of channeling women with comparable education and experience into lower salary levels,\u201d James Finberg, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the case said.\n\nThe former employees bringing the lawsuit against Google have alleged the company tied starting salary to prior pay, perpetuating wage inequality. Google discontinued this practice in 2017, but has since failed to address the existing inequalities at the company, the lawsuit alleges.\n\nGoogle\u2019s job classification system divides employees into different responsibility levels to determine tasks and compensation. Under that system, workers in the same \u201cjob family\u201d at Google are \u201cthose that are doing similar job duties and responsibilities but stratified at different levels of capabilities or skill sets\u201d. Different levels within each job family comes with different salary grades. The lawsuit alleges women were consistently pushed into lower-level job tracks and paid less than men with similar job descriptions.\n\nKelly Ellis, a plaintiff in the case, claimed she experienced this when she was first hired at Google. She felt she had enough experience to be placed at a higher responsibility level, but was told all employees are initially assigned a lower responsibility level and thus paid less.\n\n\u201cThroughout my time at Google, I always felt like I was behind where I should have been and trying to catch up,\u201d she said. Later she learned that wasn\u2019t the case for her male colleagues: they had been assigned more responsibilities and higher pay from the beginning.\n\nUltimately Google paid women less base salary, smaller bonuses, and less stock than men in equal job codes and locations, the lawsuit alleges. The likelihood of such a disparity occurring by chance rather than by direct discrimination is 1 in 100, Neumark\u2019s analysis showed.\n\nHeidi Lamar, another plaintiff in the case claims she experienced the same patterns in her position in the Google childcare facilities. She said Google management blamed it on her work quality or the performance in her initial job interview, but investigations as part of the lawsuit found this wasn\u2019t the case. In this discovery process, during which the legal team searched for evidence of discrimination, an evaluation of her interview showed she received high marks.\n\n\u201cI felt very vindicated when I saw my interview scores were higher than my male colleagues,\u201d she said. \u201cI suspected as much, but it was nice to have it proven.\u201d\n\nThe discovery process revealed a number of systemic discriminations, including that 49% of people hired as Level 2 software engineers were women but that percentage dropped for higher level positions \u2013 22% for Level 3, 14.2% for Level 4, and 7.2% for Level 5. Ellis said that when she was hired, she was asked what she was paid at her previous job and given the same salary at Google.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really realize the full extent to which I was discriminated against until I stopped working there, and I realized even more being involved in this lawsuit just how blatant and what a pattern it all was,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nTo address pay equality, Google has been running yearly pay equity analyses since 2012 said Eileen Naughton, vice president of People Operations at the company. As a result of these investigations the company made salary adjustments for 2% of employees in 2019, totaling $5.1 million.\n\n\u201cThe claims in this lawsuit are unfounded and we plan to defend our policies and practices,\u201d Naughton said.\n\nThere will be a hearing for the case on 2 December.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/22/google-gender-pay-discrimination-lawsuit", "author": ["Kari Paul"]}, {"title": "Annie Ross, British-American jazz singer and actor, dies aged 89", "text": "Performer who worked with everyone from Louis Armstrong to Robert Altman was a pioneer of the vocalese singing style\n\nAnnie Ross, the British singer who became globally famous with jazz vocal trio Lambert, Hendricks & Ross and had a varied acting career, has died aged 89 at her home in New York City.\n\nHer death was due to emphysema and heart disease, confirmed her manager, Jim Coleman.\n\nRoss was born Annabel Short in 1930 to Scottish vaudeville artists John and Mary Short, with the family emigrating to New York when Ross was four.

They need to put their ICE uniforms and CBP uniforms back on,\u201d he told The Washington Post, referring to federal immigration officers and Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAD\n\nThe public has at turns mistaken police for soldiers since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in late May triggered demonstrations and civil unrest. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper was concerned about that conflation during protests in Washington last month, his chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe want a system where people can tell the difference,\u201d he said, adding that Esper has expressed those concerns within the Trump administration.\n\nAD\n\nThe blurring of the line between military and civilian law enforcement has been fueled in part by viral videos and photos of the DHS officers\u2019 actions, former officials and lawmakers said.\n\n\u201cUnidentified military are kidnapping protestors in Portland,\u201d the Lincoln Project, a political action group critical of President Trump, incorrectly told its Twitter followers. The group repeated the assertion in a tweet paired with a campaign video that received more than 9 million views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good for our democracy,\u201d David Lapan, a former Marine officer who served as DHS spokesman under Trump in 2017, told The Post. \u201cThe public should not feel there is a militarized response to civil unrest.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTom Ridge, who served as the first U.S. secretary of homeland security, said during an interview Tuesday with broadcaster Michael Smerconish that DHS was established to protect the country \u201cfrom the ever-present threat of global terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was not established to be the president\u2019s personal militia,\u201d he said.\n\nFederal officers in D.C., Portland and elsewhere have worn what is generally called the operational camouflage pattern, or multicam \u2014 a smattering of brown, green and beige daubs adopted by the Army for use in Afghanistan in 2010. It has since become the daily wear for Army soldiers and is being fielded by the Air Force.\n\nIt is also what National Guardsmen typically wore on the streets of Washington last month during protests, with federal officers often in similar patterns. The soldiers and police intermixed, and sometimes swapped gear, further spreading confusion. In one instance, Federal Bureau of Prisons officers in blue shirts stood behind riot shields marked \u201cMILITARY POLICE.\u201d Witnesses told The Post they mistook them for National Guard soldiers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPart of the Pentagon\u2019s after-action review of the National Guard response to civil unrest focused on whether law enforcement personnel should be wearing camouflage, Hoffman said. After the review is complete, Esper may discuss the findings with Attorney General William P. Barr and acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf, Hoffman said.\n\nCBP sees itself as a paramilitary organization and has become more emboldened as the Trump administration increasingly uses it and other federal law enforcement to respond to violence, Lapan said.\n\nBut the agency\u2019s mission is law enforcement, Lapan said, not warfare. And its use of military garb, he said, can jumble those missions and misses the point of camouflage in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of camouflage is to blend in and not be visible,\u201d said Lapan, now the vice president of communications for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank. \u201cAs a law enforcement officer, you shouldn\u2019t be blending in. That defeats the purpose.\u201d\n\nCBP has defended the use of the camouflage and said it was not aware of any confusion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the standard uniform for these agents and has been since 2015,\u201d CBP said in a statement. \u201cIt is a pattern chosen to be appropriate for any operational environment.\u201d\n\nMark A. Morgan, the acting CBP commissioner, pushed back against assertions that his officers were difficult to identify. They had agency patches and police emblazoned on their vests, he told reporters Tuesday, but their names were removed to protect their identities after officers were doxed.\n\nBut former officials and lawmakers said the uniforms, and videos like the one of officers apparently breaking the hand of a Navy veteran, can chip away at the image of the military, which enjoys the highest level of trust of any public institution.\n\nAD\n\nThe use of Customs and Border Protection and other agencies as a de facto national police force could erode that trust, said Carrie Cordero, a former Justice Department national security attorney and a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAn agency in military-style uniforms pulling people off the streets is a place we don\u2019t want to be,\u201d she said.

She also believed that if a woman gave birth to a large number of children, the latter children would be weaker. And to advance the birth control movement, she spoke with the Ku Klux Klan. But her views and actions have also often been taken out of context to claim Sanger wanted to \u201cerase the black race,\u201d Katz said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMargaret Sanger has been used as a tool for the anti-reproductive rights movement,\u201d Katz said. \u201cShe was not trying to eliminate the African American race from this country.\u201d\n\nSanger worked with black leaders and ministers to give black women the same access to birth control as white women, Katz said. She was single-mindedly focused on making birth control cheap and accessible to everybody.\n\n\u201cThe problem with Sanger was she was so single-minded that she was willing to align herself with anybody,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThese are problematic positions. She did speak to the Klan. But I think obliterating her ... doesn\u2019t allow us to discuss this in any way or debate it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn recent years, antiabortion activists and conservatives have often brought up Sanger\u2019s views on eugenics to criticize Planned Parenthood and the abortion rights movement, even though Sanger did not advocate for abortion rights. In 2015, a group of conservatives and antiabortion activists unsuccessfully called for a bust of Sanger to be removed from the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.\n\nAD\n\nIn an opinion last year, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas emphasized Sanger\u2019s eugenicist views and the fact that she opened a birth-control clinic in then-majority black Harlem. He implied that Sanger wanted to restrict the growth of the black community, which multiple scholars said was misleading. Ben Carson, now U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, has made similar claims.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and its founder have often become inaccurately intertwined in conversations about sterilization abuse that occurred in hospitals in the 1960s and later, abuse that disproportionately affected black and indigenous women, said Ayah Nuriddin, a PhD candidate in the department of the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University who is writing her thesis on eugenics and the African American community. Nuriddin said it\u2019s important to distinguish between Sanger\u2019s work and views and later state-sponsored sterilization.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s racist, she\u2019s eugenicist,\u201d Nuriddin said. \u201cThat does not make her unique among her contemporaries in this period. I think there\u2019s sometimes this notion that she\u2019s somehow superlative in her racism, and that\u2019s simply not the case.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMerle McGee, chief equity and engagement officer for Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, said the organization has been having public conversations about Sanger\u2019s complicated legacy for many years, and particularly since 2014.\n\n\u201cThe Sanger legacy unchecked or unmet with a reckoning has been weaponized against women of color, and has effectively hampered our ability to be in a right relationship with women of color,\u201d McGee said. \u201cAnd we have left women of color to grapple with the totality of Sanger\u2019s legacy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut taking Sanger\u2019s name off a building does not mean the organization is completely disconnecting itself from its founder, she said.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying is we are not going to center and essentialize Margaret Sanger as all good or all bad,\u201d McGee said.\n\nNuriddin agreed it was important not to consider Sanger as either \u201ca hero or a villain.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s also important to recognize that taking a name off or taking a statue down is not the whole story,\u201d Nuriddin added, \u201cand it\u2019s not a substitute for reckoning with a complicated history.\u201d", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/07/21/margaret-sanger-planned-parenthood-eugenics/", "author": ["Samantha Schmidt", "Reporter Covering Gender", "Family Issues"]}, {"title": "As Trump deploys federal agents to Chicago, his toxic history with the city has officials, residents on edge", "text": "Aggressive tactics used by federal agents to arrest protesters in Portland amid civil unrest have only deepened suspicions among Chicagoans that Trump will do whatever he can to project the image of a law-and-order president, even if it pushes the boundaries of civil liberties.\n\n\u201cWe welcome actual partnership, but we do not welcome dictatorship,\u201d Lightfoot (D) said during a news conference Tuesday. \u201cWe do not welcome authoritarianism, and we do not welcome the unconstitutional arrests and detainments of our residents, and that is something I will not tolerate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLightfoot sent Trump a letter on Monday specifying areas where the city would welcome federal support, such as drug enforcement and tracing efforts for illegal firearms. After conferring on Tuesday with John R. Lausch Jr., the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, the mayor said the city could expect agents from various federal agencies \u2014 including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \u2014 to be \u201cplugged into existing agencies that will help manage and suppress\u201d street violence.\n\nYet despite assurances that federal agents would be guided by the Justice Department and work in coordination with Lausch, few of Chicago\u2019s leaders said they felt they could rely on plans crafted by an administration whose signature is unpredictability.\n\nChicago Alderman Matt Martin said city council members deliberated Tuesday over whether Trump\u2019s rhetoric was political posturing or a serious threat. The summer before his election, Trump told then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) that the National Guard should storm the streets of Chicago to quell violence.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it can be discounted\u201d that Trump will send in troops, Martin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to step back and be really honest and candid about the moment we are in. This is a president who doesn\u2019t outreach his arms. This is pure political gamesmanship, whether he sends in troops or not; you can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that whatever he does will be driven primarily by what he thinks the political benefits will be and not what is best for the city of Chicago.\u201d\n\nJohn Catanzara, the president of Chicago\u2019s police union, praised Trump\u2019s approach. After a protest Friday turned violent because of instigation by \u201cvigilantes\u201d attaching themselves to the demonstration, according to police, Catanzara wrote a letter to Trump asking for help to calm the \u201cchaos\u201d created in part by Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d of leadership.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nReports that mysterious federal agents swept protesters in Portland off the streets in secretive arrests have sent a chill through Chicago\u2019s activist community, with some fearing Portland is a test case for how far the Trump administration will go to suppress protests \u2014 especially when they concern issues of race and police accountability.\n\nActivists are preparing by adjusting their strategies: avoiding protests after curfew or taking action with fewer than 50 people. Alycia Kamil, a 19-year-old organizer with the anti-violence group GoodKids MadCity, said activists are already vigilant because of the fraught history between protesters and Chicago police, and that the specter of a federal crackdown only reaffirms the importance of their demonstrations.\n\n\u201c[Authorities] think us not backing down is us being violent,\u201d said Kamil, who used her middle name for safety reasons. \u201cNo \u2014 us not backing down is us being powerful and showing we have courage.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nState Rep.

The team has hired D.C. attorney Beth Wilkinson to lead a review of its culture in the wake of the allegations.\n\nAD\n\nDonaldson is the second high-profile hire the franchise has made since the allegations were made public. On Monday, Terry Bateman, a longtime adviser to Snyder and twice a former team official, was hired as executive vice president and chief marketing officer.\n\nDonaldson joined NBC Sports Washington in 2010 and hosted several of the network\u2019s shows and was a part of the network\u2019s coverage of all area teams. In recent years, she has regularly been assigned to Washington\u2019s NFL team, helping to host some of the franchise\u2019s programs that are broadcast on NBC Sports Washington.\n\nAD\n\nBefore coming to Washington, she worked for Miami\u2019s Fox Sports affiliate, New York\u2019s SNY and WHDH in Boston.\n\nAD\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation said Washington is still trying to figure out how the radio booth will look this season. Donaldson will probably host the broadcast\u2019s pregame and postgame shows and work in the booth during games. For many years, the team\u2019s broadcast centered around a three-man booth anchored by Frank Herzog and later Michael, with Hall of Fame players Sam Huff and Sonny Jurgensen providing commentary. The setup was more of a three-way conversation than a traditional radio broadcast.\n\nHuff retired after the 2012 season and was replaced by former Washington tight end Chris Cooley. Jurgensen retired last August, leaving Michael and Cooley to announce games last year.\n\nAD\n\nDonaldson has barely more than a month to hire the new play-by-play voice. While the NFL has said it will cancel all preseason games because of concerns over the novel coronavirus pandemic, the regular season is still scheduled to start on time, with Washington\u2019s opener against Philadelphia set for Sept. 13.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement released by the team, Snyder called Donaldson \u201ca trailblazing journalist who has worked on multiple award-winning shows and has a passion for sports in the DMV.\u201d The team owner added that he \u201ccan\u2019t think of anyone better\u201d to run the franchise\u2019s broadcast operations.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/21/julie-donaldson-washington-nfl-radio-voice-larry-michael/", "author": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington'S Nfl Team", "Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"]}, {"title": "Giants manager takes a knee during anthem and Trump tweets \u2018the game is over for me\u2019", "text": "The demonstration by the Giants and one by Los Angeles Angels reliever Keynan Middleton, who took a knee and raised a fist before playing an exhibition game Monday night in San Diego, were the first in MLB since Bruce Maxwell took a knee in September 2017, when NFL players and other athletes followed the example set by Colin Kaepernick by taking a knee to protest police brutality and racial injustice. The demonstrations angered the president, who saw it as criticism of the flag and the military.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow, with sports competition returning a little less than two months after the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other unarmed black people sparked protests across the country, Trump is taking the same stance that set off a national debate.\n\n\u201cMy response [to Trump] is I don\u2019t see it as disrespect at all,\u201d Kapler said Tuesday (via USA Today). \u201cI see nothing more American than standing up for what you believe in.

Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the country\u2019s leading voices during the pandemic, throwing out the ceremonial first pitch.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Kapler and other members of the Giants again took a knee before an exhibition game. \u201cWhat guides our decision,\u201d the manager told USA Today, \u201cis standing up for people who need us to stand up for them.\u2019\u2019\n\nKapler, who is in his first season managing the Giants, is believed to be the first manager or head coach in any of the four major North American pro sports leagues to protest in such a way. He told players and staff his intention Monday and said he would support whatever decision each individual made.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI wanted them to know that I wasn\u2019t pleased with the way our country has handled police brutality,\u2019\u2019 Kapler told reporters after the exhibition game Monday against the Oakland Athletics at Oakland Coliseum. \u201cI told them that I wanted to amplify their voices and I wanted to amplify the voice of the black community and marginalized communities as well.\n\n\u201cAnd so I told them I wanted to use my platform to demonstrate my dissatisfaction with the way we\u2019ve handled racism in our country. I wanted to demonstrate my dissatisfaction with our clear, systemic racism in our country.\n\n\u201cI wanted them to know they\u2019ve got to make their own decisions. And we would respect and support those decisions. I wanted them to feel safe in speaking up. We\u2019ve had these discussions the last several days, and we will continue to have them.\u201d\n\nGiants outfielders Jaylin Davis, Mike Yastrzemski and Austin Slater took a knee, as did first base coach Antoan Richardson. Shortstop Brandon Crawford stood behind Davis and Richardson with his hands on their shoulders. Last month, Davis wrote of the racial discrimination he has experienced, adding, \u201cUnless we all find a way to openly talk and genuinely listen to each other about racism, we have no hope of rooting it out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMaxwell, who has been playing for the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League for the past two seasons after his protest, took a knee before a game the day after Trump, at a rally in the catcher\u2019s native state of Alabama, called on NFL owners to \u201cfire\u201d any \u201cson of a b----\u201d who didn\u2019t stand during the anthem. Maxwell continued to protest that season and was moved by the Giants\u2019 demonstration Monday night.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of joy in my heart, honestly. There was a lot of relief,\u2019\u2019 he told USA Today\u2019s Bob Nightengale. \u201cAnd there was a lot of emotion. Just seeing the spreading of awareness, that people are seeing the injustice of humanity in our country, and for people now standing up to it, that was so joyous for me.\u201d\n\nMaxwell continued: \u201cIf I was there, I would give Kapler a big hug, shake his hand, and tell him I\u2019m honored to be next to him. That was a big step. For somebody in that position, to put his title aside, to make himself vulnerable in that situation and stand for what is right, is big for humanity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with the flag, not the military. It\u2019s a message standing up for the right cause.\u201d\n\nGiants right-hander Kevin Gausman told Nightengale that Kapler had told players they were free to decide what to do.\n\n\u201cHis biggest thing is whatever side you\u2019re on, whether you decide to stand or kneel for whatever reason, that he was going to stand by us,\u201d Gausman said. \u201cI think that\u2019s important right now.\u201d\n\nThe hashtag #boycottMLB was trending briefly Tuesday morning on Twitter, with fans saying they were done with the sport. After tweeting video of Kapler and the Giants, MLB\u2019s account stood by Kapler and the team in replies to criticism. \u201cIt has never been about the military or the flag,\u201d the account tweeted in response to one user. \u201cThe players and coaches are using their platforms to peacefully protest.\u201d It went on to add, \u201cSupporting human rights is not political,\u201d and, \u201cSupporting our players and supporting equality is not political.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe account also shared quotes from Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw.\n\nThe day after his own demonstration, Middleton explained his gesture, tweeting, \u201cKneeling for me is one way to continue to \u201cuse my platform for change in a peaceful way.\u201d\n\nAngels Manager Joe Maddon told the Los Angeles Times that Middleton had suggested the idea during a team video conference on the Black Lives Matter movement in June.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he showed you tonight,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cI have a granddaughter who\u2019s going through the same thing right now, and I totally support her reaction to all of this.\u201d", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/21/giants-manager-takes-knee-during-anthem-trump-tweets-game-is-over-me/", "author": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories", "Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"]}, {"title": "Former Fox News anchor Ed Henry accused of sexual assault in new lawsuit", "text": "Fox announced July 1 it had fired Henry, saying that he had been credibly accused by a former colleague of \u201csexual misconduct in the workplace years ago.\u201d But, the new lawsuit alleges the network\u2019s statement \u201cintentionally downplayed the severity of the situation\u201d in an attempt \u201cto avoid taking accountability for what actually happened.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the complaint, Eckhart accuses Henry of sexually assaulting her in a guest office on the 17th floor of the Fox News office building in New York in September 2015, and raping her in a New York hotel room in 2017, after handcuffing her and taking naked photographs of her.\n\nAfter Eckhart reported details of her \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d to a human resources executive and her supervisor in February 2020, the lawsuit alleges, Fox News terminated her as an act of retaliation in June, once it realized that Eckhart \u201cengaged in protected activity by hiring counsel and putting Fox News on notice of her intent to bring legal claims.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Howard Kurtz and Gianno Caldwell engaged in inappropriate and suggestive behavior.\n\nAD\n\nFox News released the following statement to The Washington Post: \u201cBased on the findings of a comprehensive independent investigation conducted by an outside law firm, including interviews with numerous eyewitnesses, we have determined that all of Cathy Areu\u2019s claims against Fox News, including its management as well as its hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Howard Kurtz and its contributor Gianno Caldwell, are false, patently frivolous and utterly devoid of any merit.\"\n\nAD\n\nIt continued: \u201cWe take all claims of harassment, misconduct and retaliation seriously, promptly investigating them and taking immediate action as needed \u2014 in this case, the appropriate action based on our investigation is to defend vigorously against these baseless allegations.

He received an outpouring of support that convinced him that perhaps a memoir was warranted, after all: \u201cI want people to know a little more about the person they have been cheering on for the past year,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt\u2019s an aper\u00e7u of Alex Trebek, human being. What is he like? What has he done? How did he screw up? Things like that.\u201d\n\nIn the opening pages of the slim book, which Trebek worked on during the coronavirus pandemic, he warns readers that, aside from contributing the occasional \u201cJeopardy!\u201d clue, he\u2019s not a writer. But those who adore him for his reassuring nature and warmth likely aren\u2019t interested in his literary prowess; they\u2019ve come for his stories. And \u201cAnswer\u201d delivers. It\u2019s an amusing and at times sobering series of vignettes \u2014 a quickly inhaled highlights reel of Trebek\u2019s life.\n\nThe memoir opens in Ontario, Canada, where Trebek grew up. After a relatively uneventful childhood, he attended the Royal Canadian Air Force military academy college \u2014 for three days. He dropped out when he learned the college planned to buzz his luscious head of hair. Instead, he studied philosophy while working as a disc jockey, ultimately spending 12 years with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the early 1970s, Alan Thicke lured Trebek to the U.S. to film a game-show pilot in Los Angeles. That led to a flurry of hosting gigs and a new Hollywood lifestyle to complement his new address. Still, Trebek jokes that he didn\u2019t easily fit in with the guys: He had no vices; his drink of choice is low-fat milk. \u201cPeople can be suspicious of someone who\u2019s so chaste,\u201d he realized, so he temporarily took up cursing.\n\nTrebek quotes Mark Twain, Malcolm Gladwell and Chinese proverbs, and he shows off a quick wit and reverence for intellect. Those are among the traits that have served him well since joining \u201cJeopardy!\u201d in 1984, when the show was revived by creator Merv Griffin. Hosting, he says, is similar to being a Broadway actor. \u201cWe both do the same show night after night, and we have to find new ways to make it unique and interesting to ourselves,\u201d he writes. \u201cI have to keep the show moving, guide it, present an environment in which the contestants are going to be performing at their very best.\u201d\n\nTrebek dishes on \u201cJeopardy!\u201d superstars like Ken Jennings \u2014 who\u2019s co-narrating the audiobook version of the memoir with him \u2014 and whisks readers backstage at the game show. He appreciates the work-life balance the show affords, taping just two days a week. On those days, Trebek arrives at 6 a.m. to start prepping. The team tapes five shows a day, with 15 minutes in between each \u2014 enough time to change suits and get a makeup touch-up. (Or abruptly shave off his signature mustache, which Trebek did in 2001 to much ballyhoo.)\n\nThe behind-the-scenes intel is fun, especially for longtime fans of the show. But the rare insights into Trebek\u2019s personal life are far more revealing. He devotes loving passages to his \u201csoulmate\u201d \u2014 his wife, Jeanie \u2014 and their two grown children, Emily and Matthew. (He\u2019s also a father figure to his first wife\u2019s daughter, Nicky.) Trebek notes that Matthew recently returned home, allegedly to weather the pandemic. It\u2019s a convenient excuse: \u201cHe recognizes this is our last go-round. He\u2019s here to spend quality time with me before we have no time left to spend together.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Trebek has had so many maladies that \u201cJeopardy!\u201d turned them into a category.

The pancreatic cancer, he acknowledges, has taken the hardest toll.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis morning I sat down with (Emily), Matt, and Jeanie, and told them I had made my decision,\u201d he writes. \u201cI\u2019m going to stick with this current protocol, then that\u2019s it. If it doesn\u2019t work I\u2019ll probably stop treatment. It wasn\u2019t an easy conversation, and it isn\u2019t any easier writing these words. Quality of life was an important consideration.\u201d\n\nTrebek then slides into more comfortable territory: a joke. He hasn\u2019t lost his levity and says he\u2019s not afraid of dying. \u201cI\u2019ve lived a good, full life, and I\u2019m nearing the end of it. I know that. The only thing that might bother me is if I pass on before I get to have grandchildren.

And, if I may, it\u2019s an important line because it\u2019s the difference between federal law enforcement and a roving commission where you\u2019re using these law enforcement officers to go out and restore what they deem to be order,\u201d said Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nAD\n\nDHS officials defended their tactics in Portland again Tuesday, saying the department has an obligation to protect government buildings in the city that have been targeted for more than 50 consecutive nights by black-clad protesters shooting fireworks, lobbing projectiles and attempting to set alight the federal courthouse.\n\nChad Wolf, the acting DHS secretary, said federal agents are not deployed widely across the city and described the situation there as \u201cunique,\u201d blaming local officials who have eschewed cooperation with the Trump administration.\n\nAD\n\nDHS agents have been deployed \u201cto protect a symbol of justice \u2014 the courthouse,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cWe mostly do that in a very defensive posture. However, we have been forced because of a lack of local enforcement presence to take measures, such as arrests, to protect our officials.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOver the weekend, demonstrators pulled down a fence, employed radio frequency jammers, attempted to set the courthouse on fire and used slingshots to hurl ball bearings and batteries at federal agents, Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said Tuesday.\n\nWhile DHS and Justice officials have strained to depict their actions in Portland as isolated, emergency measures, President Trump has undermined that message with statements linking \u201cchaos\u201d in the city to a surge in violent crime in Chicago, New York and elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nStruggling in the polls and beset by multiple crises, Trump has been eager to more widely deploy DHS personnel he views as loyal to \u201cdominate\u201d U.S. cities as he campaigns for reelection as an urban lawman.\n\nThe president has exercised federal power primarily through DHS and its subagencies, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where several top political appointees lack Senate confirmation but appear almost daily on cable television to praise Trump\u2019s resolve.\n\nAD\n\nAt the center of his strategy is a willingness to deploy U.S. border and immigration enforcement agents on American streets, relying on agents who are accustomed to operating at airports and border crossings where they are generally subject to fewer constraints than ordinary police officers. The fact that many of those officers are not accustomed to dealing with urban unrest, analysts said, is also problematic.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt increases the danger both for the law enforcement officers and for the civilian population when you have law enforcement agents who are not trained in a particular duty being asked to perform that duty,\u201d said Jonathan Meyer, a former DHS lawyer now in private practice at Sheppard Mullin.\n\nThose specialized teams are among the most \u201cheavily militarized\u201d components in federal law enforcement, normally assigned to \u201cengage in low-grade warfare against heavily armed narco-terrorists,\u201d said Paul Rosenzweig, a former DHS official who now works as a senior fellow at the R Street Institute.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think it is not illegal, but it is an expansion of mission and what I would characterize as a misapplication of authority,\u201d Rosenzweig said. \u201cSo make it lawful but awful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump has signaled that he intends to increase the federal law enforcement presence in other cities run by Democrats \u2014 drawing pushback from local mayors who say they will not welcome it.\n\nIn the coming days, two administration officials said, the Justice Department is expected to announce an expansion of its \u201cOperation Legend,\u201d an initiative to surge federal agents from the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to Kansas City, Mo., to help address a spike in violent crime. That operation, officials said, is distinct from the efforts in Portland, which have largely been focused on courthouse protection and civil unrest. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss law enforcement deployments that have not yet been made public.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the cities to which federal authorities will deploy is Chicago, according to an official familiar with the matter; that city\u2019s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, has expressed concern over the plan because of what happened in Portland.\n\nAD\n\nDHS officials familiar with the Chicago preparations say it will include about 150 ICE agents from the Homeland Security Investigations divisions, which target drug networks, human trafficking and transnational crime. The HSI agents will not be deployed in an urban policing role, officials say, and will instead help target gang members and others driving the crime increase.\n\nLegal analysts said the department is well within its legal authority to surge federal agents in cities \u2014 even to places that don\u2019t want them.\n\n\u201cFederal law enforcement is not a by-invitation-only exercise,\u201d said Jonathan Turley, a constitutional expert and criminal defense attorney who represented journalists and legal observers arrested as part of a mass roundup during demonstrations in D.C. in 2002.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDHS officials have also expanded their abilities to gather intelligence on protesters who may be targeting federal monuments and statues, according to a memo that surfaced this week. DHS officials say they are relying on open-source social media posts to find whether violent actors are planning to show up.\n\nTrump\u2019s eagerness to leverage DHS powers and \u201csend in the feds\u201d has brought a backlash that increasingly includes Republicans wary of an expanded federal role on American streets.\n\nTom Ridge, the former Pennsylvania governor who served as the country\u2019s first homeland security secretary under George W. Bush, said during an interview Tuesday with broadcaster Michael Smerconish that DHS was established to protect the country \u201cfrom the ever-present threat of global terrorism.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was not established to be the president\u2019s personal militia,\u201d Ridge said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt would be a cold day in hell before I would consent to a unilateral, uninvited intervention into one of my cities,\u201d he added, \u201cand I wish the president would take a more collaborative approach toward fighting this lawlessness than the unilateral approach he\u2019s taken.\u201d\n\nThe federal government\u2019s power is not unlimited, legal analysts said. Federal agents can only investigate and enforce federal crimes, though that gives them the ability to go after gang and drug activity or other crimes involving the crossing of state lines. They can help enforce state laws if state or local authorities give them the authority to do so \u2014 which is common on task forces with state and federal law enforcement agencies, analysts said.\n\nIf state or local officials seek to pull back that power, analysts said, it might hamper federal law enforcement\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe problem with Operation Legend is that it can only fully function with the cooperation of local law enforcement,\u201d Turley said. \u201cThe federal government has no authority to enforce local, criminal laws.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s response to the unrest is partly an outgrowth of the border crisis he faced in 2018 and 2019, when record numbers of Central American families and children crossed into the United States and overwhelmed U.S. agents. Trump responded by deploying U.S. troops and tightening immigration laws, while heaping praise on Border Patrol agents and ICE personnel.\n\nSome of the DHS officers\u2019 recent tactics have generated controversy, including their wearing of uniforms that sometimes do not clearly note their identity or which agency they work for, and their use of unmarked vans. Legal analysts, though, said such tactics \u2014 while possibly objectionable \u2014 are legal and commonplace.\n\n\u201cPolice use unmarked cars regularly to conduct arrests,\u201d Turley said.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/facing-unrest-on-american-streets-trump-turns-homeland-security-powers-inward/2020/07/21/655e7822-cb71-11ea-89ce-ac7d5e4a5a38_story.html", "author": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security", "Matt Zapotosky", "National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department"]}, {"title": "\u2018What choice do we have?\u2019: Portland\u2019s \u2018Wall of Moms\u2019 faces off with federal officers at tense protests", "text": "In front of the federal courthouse, federal agents in tactical gear used batons to push back the moms in bike helmets.

The president called the protests in Portland, a liberal Pacific Northwest city, \u201cworse than Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMayors, members of Congress and state officials have pushed back, telling the federal government they do not want nor need federal troops in their cities.

It\u2019s like: What choice do we have but to do this?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAngie Noriega, 43, attended her first protest on Monday with a group of seven other mothers who piled into two minivans and drove downtown. Noriega, a health-care worker who has two black children, ages 3 and 7, said after weeks of avoiding attending protests in person due to the coronavirus pandemic, seeing the moms of Portland mobilize inspired her to get more involved.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been such a struggle to balance being afraid, but wanting to do the right thing for my kids,\u201d she said, her voice cracking with emotion. \u201cI want to be a role model for them, someone they can be proud of. But I also want to make it home safely.\u201d\n\nBefore she left home, Noriega\u2019s 7-year-old daughter begged her not to leave. She\u2019s old enough to understand the risks of facing off with heavily armed police officers, Noriega said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut we talked about that and I said, \u2018Sometimes we have to be brave and do the right thing even when it feels scary,\u2019 \u201d Noriega said.\n\nAs Rachel Weishaar, 34, was preparing to leave her home on Tuesday, she said, her 3-year-old offered this wish for her mother\u2019s safety: \u201cTell the police officers to be more gentle,\u201d the girl said.\n\nWeishaar carried her daughter\u2019s words on a sign she held outside the federal courthouse.\n\nThe night before, hundreds of moms joined to sing a lullaby outside the Multnomah County Justice Center, the site of the county jail and police headquarters. The lyrics were simple: \u201cHands up, please don\u2019t shoot me.\u201d\n\nThough the Wall of Moms has become an overnight Internet sensation, the group has also attracted skepticism. Some scholars and racial justice activists have criticized the group and the attention it has attracted for centering the voices of mostly white mothers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlack mothers have been calling for criminal justice reform and racial equity for many years. They have lost sons and daughters at the hands of police. A group of seven mothers who have lost African American children to police action or gun violence, known as the Mothers of the Movement, have toured around the United States to protests and conferences. But they have never gone viral quite like the Wall of Moms.\n\nWall of Mom organizers said they want to help amplify the voices of mothers like these \u2014 mothers who have suffered losses and who have for years fought for systemic change in police practices.\n\n\u201cWhen you have the privilege that we have as white women, you have to use it for good, and I hope that that\u2019s what this is,\u201d said Vinson, who is white. \u201cI think it\u2019s really, really important that we gain the trust of the black community here and that\u2019s going to take some work, because we haven\u2019t always been dependable. We have an obligation to be humble, to listen and center black voices.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVinson, a cancer survivor who joined about 50 other moms at their first rally on Saturday night, said the moms continue to show up for as long as the protests go on.\n\nShe was joined Tuesday by her husband, Scott Vinson, 42, donning an orange T-shirt that has been adopted as the uniform for Portland\u2019s emerging dad activists, known collectively as the PDX Dad Pod or DadBloc.\n\nWhile the moms chanted and sang in the face of wafting tear gas, a dad in orange strolled toward the cloud of gas with a leaf blower slung over his right arm.

Margot Turner, a senior lecturer in diversity and medical education, immediately got onboard.\n\n\u201cMalone came to me and said, \u2018I\u2019m not learning anything that could help my family at home,\u2019 \u201d said Turner, who is responsible for infusing diversity into the curriculum. \u201cI told him we can change this. We worked with Dr. Tamony and applied for a student-staff partnership grant.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeter Tamony, a lecturer in clinical skills and the co-lead of a peer tutor program, had already been working for more than a year on making the curriculum at the medical school more inclusive.\n\nAD\n\nAs a doctor and educator, Tamony said he thought Mukwende\u2019s project was critical: \u201cOur methods of teaching were unfairly disadvantaging and \u2018othering\u2019 students from black and minority ethnic groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other issue is one of patient safety. Are we adequately training our students to be competent health-care professionals who can detect important clinical signs in all patient groups?\u201d\n\nWith Mukwende at the helm, he and the lecturers came up with the idea to write a book called \u201cMind the Gap: A Handbook of Clinical Signs in Black and Brown Skin.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMukwende\u2019s inspiration for the name of the handbook came from the London metro system, where warning signs saying \u201cmind the gap\u201d are used to alert passengers to take caution while crossing the gap between the train and the station platform.\n\n\u201c \u2018Mind the gap\u2019 is a warning sign to alert you of a danger and if you don\u2019t do anything about it, there can be fatal consequences,\u201d said Mukwende. \u201cSimilarly, if we don\u2019t do anything about addressing the issue at hand, people will continue being misdiagnosed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOnce the grant was approved in December 2019, the team of three co-authors began compiling a number of conditions to put in the handbook, including Kawasaki disease \u2014 which presents in an obvious red rash on white skin, but is far less conspicuous on darker skin tones \u2014 as well as skin cancer, meningitis, jaundice, eczema, psoriasis and even covid-19, among other conditions.\n\nAD\n\nMukwende spent hours each week researching for the book, he said, on top of his rigorous course load.\n\nThe manual will feature images of common clinical signs, along with descriptors and suggested language for health-care workers to learn and adopt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about the words we use,\u201d said Turner. \u201cWe are looking to decolonize the curriculum and make sure the medical education is reflective of everyone.\u201d\n\nGathering photos has been a challenge, she said, which further reinforces the lack of medical resources pertinent to nonwhite patients.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been approached by the British Association of Dermatologists and the NHS (National Health Service) digital services, because they too find it difficult to get pictures,\u201d Turner said.\n\nAD\n\nMukwende is constructing a website to address this scarcity, with the goal of encouraging people to send in their own photos to be used as examples in the handbook.\n\nIn fact, the ultimate plan for the manual is to make it a \u201clive document,\u201d whereby clinicians, medical students and patients can actively contribute their own images and descriptions.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to keep expanding the literature, not only in relation to the pictures, but in relation to the language, as well,\u201d Turner said.\n\nOthers in the medical community have vouched for the importance of the project.\n\nMinal Singh, the curriculum director at the School of Medical Sciences at the University of Manchester, and the chair of medical student education at the British Association of Dermatologists, commended Mukwende and the issues he has highlighted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think that the role of medical education is to teach across all types of diversity,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re talking about race, sexuality or social inequality, medical education must teach all varieties and backgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cMalone has identified an absolute need,\u201d Singh continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much just the visual pictures that are important, it\u2019s understanding the story the patient has told.\u201d\n\nTamony agrees. That\u2019s why part of the project includes diversity training for staff at the university.\n\n\u201cAlongside the handbook, we have been reviewing our curriculum,\u201d Tamony said. \u201cAs part of the project, our team delivered diversity training to our clinical skills peer tutors.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPatricia Louie, an incoming assistant professor at the University of Washington, who co-authored a paper in the National Library of Medicine on the representation of race and skin tone in medical textbook imagery, has done extensive research on the subject.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe found that medical textbooks overrepresented light skin tones and underrepresented dark skin tones,\u201d said Louie, adding that nearly 75 percent of the images found in widely used medical literature showcase light skin tones, while fewer than 5 percent feature dark skin tones.\n\nLikewise, her research demonstrated that the majority of textbooks used in South Africa\u2019s top medical schools also feature mostly white bodies and light skin tones, despite the fact that the population is predominantly black.\n\nAD\n\nBeyond incorporating more diverse imagery in the medical curriculum, \u201cit is pertinent that doctors understand the role that structural racism plays in producing these disparities in the first place,\u201d Louie said.\n\n\u201cMind the Gap\u201d is not the first of its kind, as similar texts have been written in the past. But the goal of this particular project is to make the content dynamic, concise and, above all, easily accessible.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe want it to be a resource that everybody around the globe can pick up and read,\u201d Mukwende said.\n\nThe project, which is supported by St George\u2019s, is nearly completed, and the authors are determining how best to disseminate the handbook, which will not be sold for profit.\n\n\u201cThis has taken off way beyond our expectations,\u201d said Turner, who said people have already started asking for copies.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this project results in lasting change to clinical training across universities and is just the start of similar initiatives by ourselves and other institutions, to level the playing field when it comes to equitable health care,\u201d said Jane Saffell, deputy principal for education at St George\u2019s.\n\nMukwende said the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 which has disproportionately impacted people of color \u2014 coupled with the global reckoning on race, has made his project more critical than ever. People are demanding change, he said, as evidenced by a recent petition with thousands of signatures, calling for medical schools to include BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) representation in clinical teaching.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy hope is that the handbook will become a staple resource in medical settings around the world,\u201d said Mukwende. \u201cI want it to empower medical professionals, so they feel more competent, and so patients can be confident that their doctors understand them.\u201d\n\nRead more:", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2020/07/22/malone-mukwende-medical-handbook/", "author": ["Sydney Page"]}, {"title": "Pandemic likely to \u2018get worse before it gets better,\u2019 Trump says in somber return to coronavirus briefing", "text": "Six months after the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the United States \u2014 and with almost 4 million confirmed infections \u2014 Trump\u2019s attempt to re-engage with the crisis and embrace public health guidelines marked a notable departure from his recent approach to the pandemic.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of developing a strategy that\u2019s going to be very, very powerful,\u201d Trump said Tuesday, reading from prepared remarks that did not include details of what the strategy would entail.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Trump continued to showcase his trademark boosterism with repeated praise of his administration, he also appeared to acknowledge that the virus he once said would soon disappear continues to pose a serious threat to the country, as well as to his reelection chances.\n\n\u201cIt will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better,\u201d he said during the 30-minute briefing in which he spoke in subdued tones. \u201cSomething I don\u2019t like saying about things, but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat somber approach harked back to late March, when Trump warned of a \u201cgreat national trial unlike any it has ever faced before\u201d and predicted a \u201cvery painful two weeks\u201d for the country.\n\nThe soberness didn\u2019t last long, as Trump spent much of April and May attacking governors who did not reopen their economies and resisting calls for the federal government to play a more central role in managing the crisis.\n\nAD\n\nPublic health experts blame much of the country\u2019s current predicament on that lack of leadership in those months \u2014 specifically pointing to Trump\u2019s unwillingness to push face coverings and social distancing as he traveled the country holding rallies and mocking people who wore masks. Trump\u2019s approval among the general public has also plummeted in recent months, with Americans giving him low marks for his leadership in crisis.\n\nAD\n\nOn the same day that his Democratic rival Joe Biden slammed him by saying \u201che\u2019s quit on this country,\u201d Trump attempted to use the revived daily briefing to prove otherwise.\n\nTrump used part of his time in the briefing room to push a public health message that many lawmakers and medical experts have been requesting for months. He praised health-care workers for saving lives, largely avoided attacks on Democrats, and urged Americans to wear masks and stay away from crowded bars.\n\nAD\n\nWhile he avoided some of the gaffes from his previous briefings and spent less time airing personal grievances, Trump still used the televised platform to break away from White House talking points and stir controversy. He contradicted press secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s claims that he gets tested multiple times a day for the virus, and he sent well wishes to a woman who has been accused of grooming Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s underage victims and recruiting them to be sexually abused over several years.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just wish her well,\u201d Trump said when asked about Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s longtime companion who prosecutors say was an accomplice in his predation.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to appear at the briefing without members of the coronavirus task force was itself a matter of controversy in the hours before the event. Fearing that the president might become distracted and unfocused without public health officials in the room, several Republicans \u2014 and some White House officials \u2014 have called for the briefings to feature less Trump and more doctors.\n\nAD\n\nBut several top health officials in the administration did not know as of Tuesday morning whether they would be participating in the briefing alongside the president.\n\nAD\n\nAppearing Tuesday on CBS News\u2019s \u201cThis Morning,\u201d U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams did not directly answer a question about whether high-profile members of the coronavirus task force would appear.\n\nAsked by co-host Gayle King whether he, White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Birx or National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci would be in attendance, Adams said: \u201cThey\u2019re still figuring that out.\u201d\n\nShortly before the briefing, Fauci told CNN he had not been invited.\n\nDuring the briefings Trump headlined in March and April, the president regularly undercut or muddled the messaging from public health officials. Trump, who rarely attended the coronavirus task force meetings, would often show up for the televised briefings with a different set of talking points.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president regularly pitched the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a \u201cgame changer\u201d even as Fauci and others cautioned that it was untested and might not serve as an effective treatment. The Food and Drug Administration has since pulled its emergency use authorization for the drug after some studies showed that it could lead to a higher risk of death.\n\nTrump also used previous briefings to contradict health experts on face coverings, telling reporters in April that he did not plan to use one. Several administration officials, including Fauci, Birx and Adams, have pleaded with Americans to use masks when in public \u2014 a message ensnared in partisan politics as Trump has vacillated on whether face coverings are a vital public health measure or a political statement.\n\nThe president appeared to reverse course on his mask skepticism on Monday, tweeting a picture of himself wearing a mask and writing that \u201cmany people say that it is Patriotic\u201d to use a face covering when social distancing is not possible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiven Trump\u2019s history of criticizing mask use \u2014 he told the Wall Street Journal in June that some Americans wore masks as a protest of him personally \u2014 some medical experts said they wished the president would model good public health by walking into the briefing room with his face covered.\n\n\u201cI genuinely hope the President wears a mask to the press briefing as a signal to the several million people watching on TV that wearing a mask is simple and important,\u201d tweeted Rob Davidson, an emergency physician and executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare, a national network of doctors that has lobbied against Trump. \u201cAt a minimum I hope he encourages all Americans to #maskup. A national mandate would be better.\u201d\n\nTrump did not wear a mask to the briefing, but he pulled one out of his pocket and \u2014 in a rare departure \u2014 did not equivocate as he called on Americans to use them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.\u201d\n\nTrump has long viewed the briefings as an opportunity to tout his handling of the pandemic and put a positive spin on the situation. Even as daily deaths were spiking in March and April, Trump told reporters that his actions had actually saved millions of lives. He repeated the claim Tuesday.\n\nTrump favorably compared the United States to other countries during the briefing, saying \u201cwe\u2019ve done much better than most.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the United States has performed far worse than most of the industrialized world in containing the spread of the virus. Cases in the United States have continued to spike in recent weeks, reaching records even as countries in Europe and elsewhere began to bring their outbreaks under control.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Americans make up less than 5 percent of the global population, the United States accounts for almost a quarter of all coronavirus deaths.\n\nAhead of the briefing, several previous White House press secretaries offered advice about how Trump should approach the briefing room.\n\nThe president \u201cshould come out and present the update on what the government is doing in terms of fighting #COVID19 and getting economy open then walk off and allow other officials to provide additional updates and answer questions,\u201d Sean Spicer, the first press secretary in the Trump White House, wrote Tuesday on Twitter.\n\nHe quoted a post from Ari Fleischer, press secretary in the George W. Bush White House, which called the briefings a \u201cmistake\u201d before going on to offer guidance.\n\n\u201cBe specific about what the Fed government is doing\u201d and \u201cGet out of the room within 30 minutes,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSarah Sanders, who succeeded Spicer, told Fox News on Monday that Trump should remind people that he is doing everything he can to protect them from the virus.\n\n\u201cDo it in a way that\u2019s compassionate \u2014 talk about how he cares about the people and remind them of that being the core of who he is,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump did take a moment during his prepared remarks to acknowledge the more than 139,000 Americans who have died \u2014 though he stopped short of taking any responsibility for lost lives.\n\n\u201cWe mourn every precious life that\u2019s been lost,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI pledge in their honor that we will develop a vaccine.\u201d", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-will-get-worse-briefing/2020/07/21/2e224734-cb63-11ea-b0e3-d55bda07d66a_story.html", "author": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter"]}, {"title": "Takeaways from Trump's coronavirus briefing return", "text": "We didn\u2019t see that version of Trump at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, but there was plenty of evidence that these briefings are geared toward shoring up Americans\u2019 widespread disapproval of his handling of the pandemic. Here are five takeaways from the return of the briefing.\n\n1. It\u2019s the Trump show\n\nRepublican strategists and some of Trump\u2019s allies have said that the best use of these briefings would be to have public health experts clearly convey to Americans what the status of the virus is, what the status of vaccine research is and how Americans can keep themselves safe in the meantime.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut rather than put recognized public health officials like Deborah Birx and Anthony S. Fauci center stage, Trump took it. In fact, he was the only one onstage. (When asked, Trump said Birx was standing \u201cright outside.\u201d)\n\nIn an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday just an hour before the briefing, Fauci said he wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nEarlier in the day, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany argued that Trump is the best person to convey information about the virus because he\u2019s the president. \u201cHe was elected by the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a leader on this.\u201d\n\nBut the data show Americans think otherwise. Trump\u2019s approval on how he\u2019s handled the coronavirus has fallen 28 points since March, according to Washington Post-ABC News polling. Now, 60 percent disapprove of the job he\u2019s doing. And he remains one of the least-trusted public figures on coronavirus.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump has calculated that he needs to be back in front of the cameras to have a chance at reelection, and he\u2019s formulated these briefings in a way that puts him at the forefront.\n\n2. Trump expressed a new level of seriousness about the virus, but he still downplayed it\n\nTrump struck a more concerned tone about the virus \u2014 at least by the standards of his previous run of briefings. \u201cIt will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better,\u201d he said. He encouraged people to wear masks, stay apart when possible and to \u201cavoid packed bars.\u201d He said he carries a mask with him and puts it on if he\u2019s in an elevator.\n\nBut he also fell back on political attacks and misleading or false statements to downplay the virus and cast blame away from him. He called the virus \u201cthe China virus\u201d and repeated his false claim that the United States has one of the lowest mortality rates in the world. He said again that the virus \u201cwill disappear,\u201d for which there is no scientific evidence, even if there is a vaccine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd he refused to acknowledge widespread problems with testing in the United States, including test shortages and slow turnaround times for results. Even some top Senate Republicans have said that testing isn\u2019t working as is. The Post has reported the Trump administration wants to block billions of dollars in federal money going to states for testing and contact tracing in a new coronavirus relief bill.\n\nUnder questioning from reporters at the briefing about that stance, Trump backed down slightly on blocking testing funds: \u201cI think that we are doing tremendous amount of testing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the doctors and the professionals feel that even though we\u2019re at a level that nobody ever dreamed possible, that they would like to do more, I\u2019m okay with it.\u201d\n\n3. Trump did not offer any clear updates about the virus or a vaccine\n\nThis week, a major vaccine candidate reported promising results and could soon move to greater testing. At the briefing, Trump offered vague predictions about what that means for Americans: \u201cNobody\u2019s going to maybe ever fully understand, but we\u2019ll end up with a cure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll end up with therapeutics, will end up with a vaccine very soon or three.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the president is not a vaccine or public health expert. (Nor is he expected to be.) So his predictions carry less weight than had they come from someone who is steeped in the science, especially given how much Trump has questioned, contradicted and even derided experts like Fauci.\n\nFauci told CNN on Tuesday that the latest vaccine developments underscore what he has been repeating for months: That he\u2019s cautiously optimistic there could be a vaccine candidate by late this year or early 2021.\n\n(Then it\u2019s a question of ramping up production globally \u2014 not an easy task.)\n\n4. Trump does not have a response to his administration\u2019s failures on containing the virus\n\nTrump\u2019s primary defense Tuesday about the virus ravaging the South and Southwest is to deny reality: \u201cI think we\u2019ve really started it up very successfully,\u201d he said of America reopening.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nContrast that with detailed reports this weekend in The Washington Post and New York Times that show Trump and his administration missed signs about the virus spreading as he pushed states to reopen before they were ready. As a result, the United States is one of the only industrialized countries to still be facing such high infection rates.\n\nThe rest of Trump\u2019s defense about his handling of the virus is the same as it was five months ago, when Americans first realized the virus was here: That he shut down travel from China and Europe (the latter of which backfired in its containment strategy and came too late anyway), and that he tried to ramp up personal protective equipment for health-care providers (which is now again in short supply in some hard-hit states).\n\nAll of that hasn\u2019t worked so far to improve how Americans view his response.\n\n5. Expect a lot more briefings\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be doing these quite often,\u201d Trump said on his way out the door of a very short briefing for him. In the spring, they stretched some two hours. This one lasted around 30 minutes.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/21/takeaways-trump-coronavirus-briefing-return/", "author": ["Amber Phillips", "Reporter For The Fix Analyzing Congress"]}, {"title": "White House, GOP in disarray over coronavirus spending plan as deadline nears on expiring emergency aid", "text": "Complicating matters, other Republican lawmakers appeared mortified about the growing size of the spending bill, leading to bickering over which policies to remove and warning that miscalculations could allow Democrats to seize control of the White House and the Senate in November.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat in the hell are we doing?\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who according to multiple officials was incensed at the push to boost spending levels, asked his colleagues at the lunch with the administration negotiators, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the exchange.\n\nThe whole process now appears likely to spill into August, something the White House and congressional Democrats had hoped to avoid, because it would mean more than 20 million Americans would lose emergency unemployment benefits when they expire at the end of this month. They have not mapped out a plan for what would happen to these people as the pandemic\u2019s turmoil continues to weigh on the U.S. economy.\n\nPart of the problem stemmed from the White House\u2019s failure to go into the talks with a preset strategy or a list of proposals that they knew GOP lawmakers would rally behind. This miscalculation created immediate problems. Numerous demands the White House had tried to formulate over the weekend were erased within hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday that the goal was to keep the spending bill around $1 trillion, but by Tuesday he had abandoned that. White House officials also indicated they would no longer push for cuts to testing and the CDC. And after a barrage of criticism of Trump\u2019s tax cut demand, White House officials stopped trying to press the matter.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to spend what we need to spend, and we\u2019re going to make sure we don\u2019t spend more than that,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nDemocrats pointed fingers at the Republican infighting and said the White House and GOP leaders were unprepared to handle the country\u2019s mounting economic and health care challenges. House Democrats passed a $3 trillion spending bill in May that would send another round of stimulus checks, provide more money to states and help hospitals, among other things, but the White House has vowed to block it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRepublicans are in complete disarray,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. \u201cTotally incompetent. Totally in disarray. Totally at war with one another.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to bridge differences, Mnuchin, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow met with Senate Republicans over lunch. But that led to little progress, as Republicans made clear to Mnuchin and Meadows that they were not supportive of Trump\u2019s insistence on a payroll tax cut or curbed funding for coronavirus tests and the CDC.\n\nRepublicans do appear to be gravitating toward a proposal on what to do about the expiring unemployment benefits, however. In March, Congress approved an additional $600 weekly benefit through the end of July for unemployed Americans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats have proposed extending those benefits through January, but the White House and some Republicans now want to cut the extra benefits to about $200 per week. Democrats haven\u2019t agreed to this, however.\n\nRepublicans were finding a harder time coming to a consensus on many other issues. Mnuchin on Monday had insisted the payroll tax idea was in the bill, but he didn\u2019t even bring it up during the lunch as the opposition snowballed, two people briefed on the interaction said.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t reached a conclusion on anything,\u201d Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said when the lunch ended.\n\nMeadows acknowledged the discontent, telling reporters, \u201cWell as you can imagine, any time you have Senate Republicans there, you have a number of different thoughts on what should or should not happen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nUnderlying the confusion surrounding the GOP stimulus package are tensions among Trump administration officials about their priorities.\n\nTrump is being represented on Capitol Hill by Mnuchin and Meadows, a tandem that hasn\u2019t brokered a deal jointly with Congress before. Trump has for months privately worried that Mnuchin, his chief negotiator with Democrats, was giving away too much to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), leading conservative lawmakers to push for Meadows to have a more active role in this round of talks. Before joining the White House, Meadows was a congressman and leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Mnuchin, meanwhile, has a background as a banker and a Hollywood producer with few ties to the conservative movement.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, Meadows sat toward the back of the room and deferred to Mnuchin as he led the conversation with the GOP senators, according to two people aware of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. Mnuchin discussed the importance of sending another round of stimulus checks and providing more money for the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nAD\n\nMnuchin also told reporters it was important for lawmakers to reach an agreement before the supplemental increase in unemployment benefits runs out by the end of this month. Republican lawmakers, including Trump, have consistently bashed that benefit increase because they think it makes it more lucrative for workers to stay home than reenter the labor market, but Mnuchin stressed the importance of providing some financial cushion for the jobless.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to try to get something done before the enhanced unemployment insurance expires. There\u2019s a lot of people who are still out of work,\u201d Mnuchin said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters, though, that it was very unlikely a deal would be reached by the end of next week, laughing and saying no when asked whether that was possible.\n\nAD\n\nOne area the White House appeared to be shifting its position on was whether to include more money for coronavirus testing. Over the weekend, the White House had opposed new money for testing, but Senate Republicans pushed back. On Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said the administration would seek \u201ctargeted\u201d money for testing, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re willing to put in money for targeted testing that makes sense, not just dumping money into a pot that contains $10 billion.\u201d\n\nThese programs are just one part of what the administration and McConnell had envisioned as a $1 trillion package that is likely to be the last major coronavirus relief bill before the election. But the price tag appeared to be growing.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans have spent much of the past several days clashing over how to handle Trump\u2019s demand for a payroll tax cut plan. Mnuchin and Meadows were met with so much blowback to the idea at the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday that Mnuchin didn\u2019t try to persuade anyone to reconsider, several attendees said.\n\nAD\n\nHe was also confronted by multiple complaints about the size of the emerging package, with some lawmakers who had voted for the $2 trillion Cares Act in March saying they couldn\u2019t support the new package if it were to exceed $1 trillion.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) argued against the payroll tax cut, making the case that no voters would notice the tax relief and that he was skeptical that the policy changes could even be implemented before October.\n\nAD\n\nElectoral politics were also in consideration at the lunch. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) urged other GOP senators to be attentive to what Republicans in competitive reelection bids are hearing on the ground from voters, and he made the case that if the GOP loses the majority, Democrats in control will implement policies that are much more costly to the national debt. So spending a bit more money now in a rescue bill that would aid Republicans in their races would be cheaper in the long run, he argued. Cotton is also up for reelection in November but is not considered to be in a competitive race.\n\nAD\n\nCotton\u2019s viewpoint appeared to clash with that of Cruz, who vigorously warned against spending too much money in the package and said it could lead to a revolt among conservative voters in November.\n\nCruz said the GOP should be focused on a safe restart of the economy. He said if the economy remains shuttered in November, Democrats will win both the White House and the Senate and that Republican senators, who usually meet in the ornate Mansfield Room in the Capitol, will \u201cbe meeting in a much smaller lunchroom\u201d next year.\n\nMcConnell did provide some details of what he hoped would be an eventual GOP package. He said it would include $105 billion to help schools reopen, another round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, more stimulus checks to individual Americans, incentives for hiring and retaining workers, and reimbursement for businesses to establish safety measures.\n\n\u201cThe American job market needs another shot of adrenaline,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cSenate Republicans are laser-focused on getting American workers their jobs back.\u201d\n\nTrump has already enacted four laws that provided close to $3 trillion in new tax cuts and spending to try to help the economy and health-care system navigate the coronavirus pandemic. The economy remains weak, however, with an unemployment rate of 11.1 percent and millions of people collecting unemployment benefits. Lawmakers are split over what to do next. When he was heading into a meeting with Senate appropriators, Meadows was asked about the highest price tag they could agree to.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/21/coronavirus-trump-congress-stimulus/", "author": ["Erica Werner", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On Economic Policy", "Jeff Stein", "Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter"]}, {"title": "Live updates: Trump says pandemic will \u2018get worse before it gets better\u2019 as daily coronavirus deaths top 1,000", "text": "An estimated 9 in 10 people displaying symptoms of the coronavirus in the Australian state of Victoria are failing to isolate after being tested for the infection, leading to a spike in cases that has sparked the country\u2019s worst numbers since the pandemic began.\n\nOn Wednesday, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews criticized the actions of those who had failed to abide by the stay-at-home measures and threatened to extend lockdown restrictions as the densely populated state reported 484 new cases and two deaths from the virus.\n\nAndrews said he was \u201cvery unhappy and very sad\u201d that of the 3,810 cases recorded between July 7 and July 21, almost 9 in 10 people (3,400 cases) failed to isolate during the period of feeling unwell and taking a coronavirus test and then waiting for results.\n\n\u201cPeople have felt unwell and just gone about their business.

(There are four more episodes left to the season \u2014 which was filmed just before the pandemic-related shutdowns \u2014 including the finale, which is Aug. 12.)\n\nFor one thing, crowd appeal \u2014 a key factor that judges Jennifer Lopez, Derek Hough and Ne-Yo are measuring \u2014 isn\u2019t confined to extreme, acrobatic tricks, even here. It doesn\u2019t matter whether dancers are competing before millions of TV viewers for a $1 million prize, as they\u2019re doing on this show, or whether they\u2019re soaring in an opera house or they\u2019ve micro-calibrated for the small screens of Instagram and TikTok. What sets the most interesting dancers apart is a yin-yang tension of musical responsiveness (watching them, we want to be swept away) and astonishment (we also want to be pulled up short).\n\nThat\u2019s why a small-scale dance style like tutting, which focuses on angular shapes of the arms, hands and fingers, can project unexpectedly if it\u2019s inventive and well-directed. The three French street dancers of Geometrie Variable proved this in WOD\u2019s \u201cduel\u201d round on July 14.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey took tutting beyond the crisp two-dimensionality inspired by Egyptian hieroglyphics (the King Tut roots of its name). Responding to Flume\u2019s stuttering, bittersweet \u201cNever Be Like You,\u201d the trio sculpted itself into a fast-paced fantasy of machines and hinged contraptions and even, eerily, a guillotine matched to a chilling sound effect.\n\nThe three men barely moved apart, working together in a tightknit brotherhood. They didn\u2019t explode with crazy energy or take up a lot of space. They created corporeal pictures that grew and transformed not by virtue of muscular force, but through intricate interconnections. That was the human, and the most moving, dimension.\n\nIt was a taut, compact starburst of a performance, which Hough rightly praised as \u201csurgical.\u201d And at the end, after all the fine-tuned detail, came a surprise that made you catch your breath: One of the dancers broke from the others and flew into a flip, spinning smoothly like a coin tossed in water.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe throughline of WOD is: Show us something we\u2019ve never seen before. As a dance critic, I want to see that, too, whenever I\u2019m in the theater. What new revelation jumps out in a premiere, or in a reinterpretation of a classic work? What fresh response is there to the music, the setting, the story? Part of \u201cnew\u201d involves sheer novelty, but part of it is also framing \u2014 how the choreographer and the dancer set up a moment for the best impact. Like the tutter\u2019s scene-stealing chin, or the group breaking apart for a sudden solo backflip.\n\nOn WOD, there\u2019s not a lot of time to shine: The format is a two-minute performance followed by instant appraisal. So the judges are focused and get right to the point. This is one of the show\u2019s great strengths. Hough\u2019s forte is identifying the elements that succeed or fail. Ne-Yo has an eye for unusual moments. J-Lo, with her hearty, buoyant good humor, nevertheless cuts to the bone: Are you going to wow America? Can you compete against all the others? Do you have what it takes to win? It\u2019s not for nothing that she\u2019s the boss judge (and one of the show\u2019s executive producers). She makes the simplest, clearest case for who belongs on the show, or doesn\u2019t, and she draws on honest values: the elements of her own starpower.\n\nFor example, J-Lo told one group that when she\u2019s putting her own concerts together, a ballad might be a nice part of the package. \u201cBut if I\u2019m going to come out for only two minutes,\u201d she said while narrowing her eyes at the lead dancer, \u201cI\u2019m gonna need to slay.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGot that, WOD hopefuls? You have a very tiny window to impress. Don\u2019t fill it with anything less than killer material.\n\nAll of the judges zero in on the art of drawing the eye, the ability to make an action leap out at us because we\u2019ve been directed to see it. In the qualifying rounds, the all-female group Pumpfidence did this the wrong way. They strutted and twisted in heels to a J-Lo song, but J-Lo, who knows more than a little about performing in heels, told them theirs were so high that they were distracting.\n\nShe faulted the Dutch popping group Oxygen for not \u201cpushing the boundaries\u201d and losing the beautifully coordinated weirdness that had made them stand out.\n\nAD\n\nAll three judges swooned over Styles & Emma, a highly attractive ballet duo that combined long, stretchy flexibility with powerful lifts and jumps. Guest judge Stephen \u201ctWitch\u201d Boss was their biggest advocate when it came to the \u201credemption\u201d round, where they competed against Oxygen. Comparing ballet and hip-hop sounds untenable, but this show is pretty consistent in what it values \u2014 surprise, clean execution, a vivid relationship to the music \u2014 so you could kind of compare the dance styles on those points.\n\nAD\n\nOxygen, donning hats and gloves, fired off a snappy, stylish number with cascades of syncopated precision hits rippling through the group, and they left everyone gasping. By contrast, there was a sameness about Styles & Emma, with one leggy, gorgeously extended move after another. The basic structure never changed: He was the target, and she was the projectile. Twitch had seemed to note this when he lamented after an earlier performance that he \u201cwanted to see y\u2019all dance together more.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a request for simple human harmony, not just the tricks. Twitch brought the emphasis back to an essential performance value: the ability to touch our own humanity. He reminded us how good it feels when we can connect with dancers vicariously, on a plain, earthy, human level. When we can see something of ourselves in them. I\u2019m glad Twitch brought this to the fore; it\u2019s a grounding value, quite different from jaw-dropping extremes of physicality. Styles & Emma were eliminated, and while I was sorry to see them go \u2014 as Twitch said, their art form is underrepresented on the show \u2014 I can understand why they were cut. They didn\u2019t take his note.\n\nAD\n\nA sense of harmony and oneness ran throughout Geometrie Variable\u2019s routine, especially in that chin-ography bit, with its wacky, chummy connection between two men. The evident unity among the three dancers helped create a performance that was emotionally moving as well as astonishing technique-wise.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/theater_dance/what-nbcs-world-of-dance-gets-right-about-dance/2020/07/21/b8dcafe4-cae2-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html", "author": ["Sarah L.

Jordan among its executive producers.\n\n\u201cThe Good Fight\u201d\n\nEven if you watched and loved CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d you may not have seen this spinoff \u2014 following the unexpected second act of veteran prosecutor Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) at a predominantly black law firm \u2014 because it\u2019s only available on CBS All Access, the network\u2019s streaming platform. Let us reiterate what Washington Post TV critic Hank Stuever said following the show\u2019s 2017 premiere: It\u2019s worth yet another subscription. Now on the heels of its fourth season (shortened because of the global pandemic), \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d has continued to impress critics with sharp if forceful commentary on the legal system and its limitations. It helps that the show is infused with the slightly surreal DNA of its predecessor \u2014 a trademark of creators Robert and Michelle King.\n\n\u201cGodfather of Harlem\u201d\n\nForest Whitaker plays legendary Harlem drug kingpin Bumpy Johnson in this thrilling prequel series to the \u201cAmerican Gangster\u201d film. The show begins with Johnson\u2019s release from Alcatraz; his return to New York pits him against Italian mob boss Vincent \u201cThe Chin\u201d Gigante (Vincent D\u2019Onofrio). The Epix series also incorporates other real-life figures including Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch, in a repeat role) and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. (Giancarlo Esposito), both of whom build a strategic alliance of sorts with Johnson.\n\n\u201cGentleman Jack\u201d\n\nThis HBO period drama, a collaboration with the BBC, explores the life and diaries of Anne Lister, the 19th-century landowner who flouted societal mores as an open and unapologetic lesbian. Suranne Jones plays the protagonist, whom we meet as she is reeling from a breakup with a woman who rejected her by accepting a marriage proposal from a man. Anne sets her sights on upgrading the now-historic estate she inherited from her family \u2014 and courting the heiress neighbor she hopes to make her wife. Stuever called the eight-episode series, renewed for a second season, one of last year\u2019s \u201cmost engaging dramas.\u201d\n\n\u201cSearch Party\u201d\n\nThis tongue-in-cheek satire follows a group of self-absorbed millennials, led by Dory (Alia Shawkat), who become obsessed with the mysterious disappearance of a college classmate. The series became a sleeper hit after landing somewhat unceremoniously on TBS in 2016. It has since moved over to HBO Max, where the dark comedy\u2019s third season premiered last month. As Dory and her friends confront the consequences of their inadvertently criminal high jinks, \u201cSearch Party\u201d continues to deliver smart, exacting commentary on the listlessness of young adulthood.\n\n\u201cWynonna Earp\u201d\n\nThis Syfy series follows Wynonna (Melanie Scrofano), great-great-granddaughter of the legendary Wyatt Earp, as she battles literal demons: the ghosts of the outlaws slain by her forefather. Creator Emily Andras has said the supernatural Western draws inspiration from \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d which she told the Hollywood Reporter was ultimately \u201cabout being a woman in the modern world and carving your path and making your own family.\u201d \u201cWynonna Earp\u201d excels at those themes, and has also earned praise for LGBT representation, particularly around the show\u2019s most-shipped couple, \u201cWayhaught.\u201d Stream the show\u2019s first three seasons on Netflix; the fourth will arrive July 26 on Syfy.\n\n\u201cSorry for Your Loss\u201d\n\nNot everything that pops up on Facebook is good but we highly recommend this series, which stars Elizabeth Olsen as Leigh Shaw, a widow grieving the sudden death of her husband. The chaos that unfolds in the wake of this monumental loss feels poignant and real. It\u2019s a shame Facebook Watch canceled the series after two seasons.\n\n\u201cImposters\u201d\n\nA beautiful con artist (Inbar Lavi) is pursued by several of her former victims in this comedy that aired on Bravo for two seasons before being canceled. Their vengeance takes them on an international journey that\u2019s twisty and fun. Available to stream on Netflix, \u201cImposters\u201d makes for a perfectly respectable binge.\n\n\u201cTwin Peaks: The Return\u201d\n\nWe get it: At 18 episodes, Showtime\u2019s ambitious \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d reboot seems like a long slog. Perhaps that\u2019s why the series courted such a small audience when it premiered opposite HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d in summer 2017. But if you\u2019ve got time \u2014 and a subscription to the premium cable network \u2014 it\u2019s worth your (re)consideration. As Stuever wrote that August, the reboot \u201cturned out to be a stunning rumination on heroic good and innate evil, told through a refreshingly coherent, expertly paced plot that managed to keep its loyal fans and curious newcomers guessing the entire way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Baby-Sitter\u2019s Club\u201d\n\nNetflix\u2019s adaptation of Ann M. Martin\u2019s beloved novels honors our enduring nostalgia around the franchise, while also giving the BSC universe a few updates that feel contemporary and important \u2014 but never forced. The show\u2019s cast, notably more diverse than other adaptations, introduces a host of new talent who embody the spirits of Kristy, Mary Anne, Claudia and Stacey.

Here\u2019s how to buy and use it.", "text": "We all grew up hearing that it\u2019s not what\u2019s on the outside but the inside that counts, that you can\u2019t judge a book by its cover, and all those other oft-repeated pieces of wisdom. Of course, as we\u2019ve learned, those things apply to food, too.\n\nUgly produce, misfit produce, whatever you want to call it: Those misshapen, bumpy, sometimes holey fruits and vegetables can taste just as good as their more pristine cousins. At farmers markets, they\u2019re typically referred to as seconds.\n\n[4 tips to help you get the most out of that farm box or CSA share produce]\n\nSeconds can be a great way to get a deal on a large amount of food, while helping farmers waste less food from the fields. Here\u2019s some advice.\n\nKnow what you\u2019re getting. Liz Whitehurst, owner of Maryland\u2019s Owl\u2019s Nest Farm, says she most often offers seconds on tomatoes. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of quality issues that can come up,\u201d she says, such as holes, splits or bruises. Different farmers may use different criteria for deciding what qualifies as a second. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s about size, sometimes it\u2019s about shape, sometimes it\u2019s about quality,\u201d Whitehurst says. Farmers may also decide to second \u2014 Whitehurst says the term can be used as a verb as well \u2014 produce that is particularly ripe. That\u2019s why you might find discounted peaches over the summer. Often, the problems are merely cosmetic \u2014 dented winter squash or scarred or russeted apples, for example.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask. There\u2019s no need to feel ashamed about asking whether a vendor has any seconds to sell, if you don\u2019t see any on display. To catch the eyes of people walking by, \u201cI want to put my best quality, my most perfect looking things\u201d out for display, Whitehurst says. So seconds might be stored under the table or back on the truck. Be considerate about the farmer\u2019s time, and try to inquire at a less busy time, either at the beginning or end of the market. Also feel free to call ahead if you want to put in a request. Avoid the hectic harvesting and packing days if you can.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re cheating the farmer, either. They\u2019ll sell the seconds if they want \u2014 not everyone does, as some use them for their own canned products \u2014 and at a price they think is appropriate. Just don\u2019t try to bargain them down, which Whitehurst says some customers do.\n\n[Frequently asked questions: Tomato canning]\n\nThink about what you want to make. Produce appearance is not important in a lot of recipes, but there are certain applications for which seconds are especially ideal, when the fruit or vegetables will be completely broken down. That might include sauces (tomato, applesauce), canned goods (crushed tomatoes, salsa, jam) and drinks or drink components (shrubs, bloody mary mix). As Post contributor and canning expert Cathy Barrow says, just be sure to cut away any bad spots while you\u2019re prepping your ingredients. Less-than-pristine apples are fine for pie, and no one will know your greens were holey before you wilted them. Puree fruit into a smoothie and ice pops, vegetables into an elegant soup.\n\n[Ice pops are a quintessential summer treat. Here\u2019s how to make your own.]\n\nBe prepared to make it. Seconds may not have the same shelf life as regularly priced produce and may need to be used in the next day or two. \u201cAny time you\u2019re buying in bulk, having a plan is important,\u201d Whitehurst says. So not only do you want to have your recipe in mind, you want to have all the other ingredients you need to make it. Also important: equipment, especially if you\u2019re going to be canning and require jars, bands and lids. I\u2019m pretty sure every time I have set out to make strawberry jam, I have momentarily panicked about not having my pectin (thankfully, I did, I just can never remember where I put it). Ingredients like that or, say, pickling salt may require even more forethought and could be trickier to grab at the last minute if your grocery store is not particularly well-stocked.\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nIt\u2019s everything but the bagel with this summer tomato tart inspired by a deli favorite\n\nYour food scraps deserve another shot.

Texas, Florida and Arizona are among the states already on the brink of overwhelming their health-care systems. More and more intensive-care units will reach and exceed capacity. Arizona has already implemented \u201ccrisis standards of care\u201d to ration its increasingly scarce resources.\n\nPolicymakers have instituted some mitigation measures, but most are too little, too late. Arizona bars are closed, but not restaurants. Some counties in Florida are requiring masks, but the governor refuses to issue a statewide mandate. Politicians are pushing for in-person schooling to begin next month even as test positivity approaches 20 percent there and results take up to two weeks. If schools reopen in this hotbed of infections, outbreaks will quickly mushroom and sicken students, teachers and their families.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere will be a breaking point. Perhaps it will come when patients can\u2019t access non-coronavirus health services: when women in labor or heart attack patients are turned away from ERs. In the meantime, the United States is on track to surpass 200,000 deaths by the fall. By then, out-of-control spread is estimated to leave nearly 1 in 4 Americans unemployed.\n\n2. Full shutdown. A full shutdown would mean that everyone in the entire country stays at home for four to six weeks. Those already infected would spread the virus only to their immediate households. If no one has additional contacts, we collectively starve the virus and stop transmission.\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: Didn\u2019t we try that already, back in March? Some states did, and it worked: The New York region is a case in point. But only half the states had full stay-at-home orders at the end of March. Many states began loosening restrictions even as infection rates there climbed. At best, the United States \u201cflattened the curve,\u201d with roughly 17,000 daily infections as our lowest point. Contrast that with Germany, Australia, South Korea and many other countries that crushed their curves and brought their case counts essentially to zero. That\u2019s how these other countries have resumed most parts of pre-pandemic life. Their schools opened with few outbreaks; businesses are back; and large-scale events such as concerts are beginning to safely take place.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is an argument for a do-over \u2014 but this time, we all do it and we do it right. \u201cThe idea of a hard shutdown should be on the table,\u201d says Andy Slavitt, former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u201cIt would be more difficult and disruptive, but the short-term pain could bring the economy back more quickly.\u201d An added benefit: If we were to reduce cases that much, we would have enough testing and contact tracing when reopening.\n\n3. Whack-a-mole. However effective a full shutdown would be, many would say it\u2019s too impractical. Some believe it may not be necessary. As Harvard global health professor Ashish Jha explains, \u201cWe can take a more targeted approach than we did in March; we don\u2019t need to shut down the places that are doing well.\u201d States facing the most dire conditions will need some version of stay-at-home orders until they hit specific goals, such as test positivity rates below 5 percent, results returned in less than 48 hours and sustained downward trends in infections for 14 days. Others trending in the wrong direction must reinstitute some restrictions until they can meet these metrics, too.\n\nWould this approach be sufficient? Perhaps, though the rebound that follows reopening would be much more rapid than with \u201cfull shutdown\u201d since cases would not be fully suppressed. Problems of inadequate testing and tracing are almost certain to recur. There is also no evidence from other countries that such a piecemeal approach would work. Some states could get their infections under control but experience surges as a result of interstate travel. And even if political will exists to close businesses (and to offer necessary support for small businesses and employees), there will again be tremendous pressure to reopen before doing so is safe.\n\nSo which scenario will it be?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is America\u2019s third strike,\u201d says professor and epidemiologist Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota. First, the country wasn\u2019t prepared for a pandemic. Next, the U.S. response was far from adequate \u2014 and we still lack a national strategy.\n\nDecision time has arrived. Is the specter of \u201cstatus quo\u201d bad enough to force an urgent course correction, or will complacency continue until death hits home for more families? It would take a lot to switch to \u201cwhack-a-mole\u201d \u2014 and a \u201cfull lockdown\u201d would save even more lives.

Certainly, we are creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, \u2018Oh, we have more cases.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. President, we have more cases because we have more sickness. In mid-May, the United States was recording about 23,000 new cases a day, but after ill-considered, premature reopenings and a virus surge, the daily total reached more than 74,000 last Friday. A revealing analysis by the health news organization STAT of all 50 states and D.C. shows that in only seven states was the rise in reported cases from mid-May to mid-July driven primarily by increased testing. In 26 states, the case count rose because there was more disease. For example, the number of cases per 1,000 tests, a measure of the disease prevalence, was 32 in Florida on May 13, rising to 75 on June 13 and 193 on July 13. The jump in hospitalizations reinforces the conclusion that the coronavirus is spreading. Still, Mr. Trump ridiculously brushes it off: \u201cMany of those cases are young people that would heal in a day. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDiagnostic testing has risen in frequency to about 800,000 tests a day, or more than 5.4 million a week, but this is still way below what\u2019s really needed. The surge in viral outbreaks has swamped existing testing networks, creating new bottlenecks for supplies such as chemical reagents and equipment, and prolonging the wait for test results for many people to a week or more. That delay can make contact tracing \u2014 also vital \u2014 practically impossible. The Rockefeller report calls for a massive scale-up of cheap, fast screening tests, say up to 25 million a week, and cutting the processing time for diagnostic testing to 48 hours.\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) said over the weekend, \u201cThe national testing scene is a complete disgrace.\u201d If Mr. Trump can\u2019t lift a finger, Congress must. In the next round of stimulus, Congress ought to inject robust new financial support for testing, especially aimed at overcoming the supply-chain troubles that are hampering every state trying to act alone, and to support expanded methods such as pooled testing and antigen testing. In his White House news conference Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that if medical experts want more testing, \u201cI am okay with it.\u201d The urgency is much greater than the president lets on; a leader would make it happen, not be \u201cokay with it.\u201d Congress should try again to spur a national strategy, enabling and encouraging governors to pick up the slack.\n\nAll roads out of this pandemic require more testing.

No one seems to know her name yet; the Los Angeles Times described her as an \u201capparition\u201d emerging out of a hazy night. You might have thought the story-spinners would have called her some sort of nymph. Instead, they named her Athena, goddess of war.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNaked Athena bursts into the national consciousness as one of those symbols that provides convenient moral clarity at a time when, otherwise, things might be hazy. She\u2019s the sleeker version of this week\u2019s Wall of Moms. These mothers made a human-link fence around protesters to shelter them from harm by supposed peacekeepers \u2014 and they were pepper-sprayed just like the rest.\n\n\u201cCalling all moms,\u201d their organizing Facebook page reads. \u201cLet\u2019s do what we do best \u2014 protect people.\u201d Certainly it\u2019s tougher to justify your own violence by claiming you\u2019re trying to prevent violence when your victims have explicitly cast themselves as society\u2019s nurturers.\n\nAthena, of course, wasn\u2019t especially motherly, and she didn\u2019t even have a mother herself. She\u2019s supposed to have sprung from her father, Zeus\u2019s, head fully grown and fully outfitted in the garments of a fighter. Which is why the mythology the activists have revived packs a punch. They\u2019ve bestowed the mantle of a famous warrior on an anonymous figure who never took up any weapons at all \u2014 who eschewed not only the trappings of the battle but any trappings at all.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019ve seen symbols like this before. Occasionally they\u2019ve stepped into starring roles, as Rosa Parks did when she refused to move to the back of a Montgomery, Ala., public bus. You could cynically cast a man defending his rights as aggressive, and convince a racist nation, but it was a harder sell with a bespectacled middle-aged woman. Occasionally our symbols have never sought attention, and earned it only after terrible suffering, as a 9-year-old Phan Th\u1ecb Kim Ph\u00fac did when she ran screaming down a South Vietnam road as napalm burned her back. No longer was it possible to see the United States on the side of the angels.\n\nThe Naked Athena, bending into ballet poses as her armed adversaries stand stiff-limbed yards away, gives the rest of us a prism through which to understand what\u2019s happening in Portland. Badge-less authorities and warrantless arrests are indefensible, though some may try to defend them. But even people sympathetic to protesters\u2019 goals have shrugged at the riot gear, and shrugged at the gas, because somehow order has to be maintained. Because these people\u2019s job is to protect not only the populace but also property, and the windows of a federal building are reduced now to shards.\n\nAdmittedly, there\u2019s ample gray in this world, and there\u2019s ample gray in today\u2019s uprisings. It\u2019s understandable that people whose ancestors were treated as property would target property now \u2014 challenging their fellow Americans to defend bricks-and-mortar more vigorously than they defend darker-skinned citizens\u2019 lives. And it\u2019s understandable, at the same time, that police would attempt to prevent looting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet when some things are gray, the gray threatens to swallow up even what should be black-and-white. This is where symbols can help us. They throw reality into relief, and let everyone see what ought to be obvious. That tossing a brick isn\u2019t the same thing as tossing a half-eaten apple; that violence from some isn\u2019t a reason to assume violence from all; that city streets aren\u2019t combat zones to start with but become combat zones when those with the biggest guns treat them that way.\n\nThese forces the president has dispatched to defend a city that hasn\u2019t asked for defending, dressed up to take down an enemy army that barely exists, are doing exactly what the utterly exposed woman was doing right back at them: putting on a show.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/21/naked-athena-put-show-portland-just-like-trump/", "author": ["Molly Roberts", "Editorial Writer Covering Technology", "Editorial Writer"]}, {"title": "Opinion | The new season of Trump\u2019s pandemic reality show is headed for early cancellation", "text": "If only he hadn\u2019t taken the bait when Steven Nelson of the New York Post asked him about Ghislaine Maxwell, the woman accused of aiding Jeffrey Epstein in the sexual abuse of minors.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just wish her well,\u201d Trump said.\n\nYou could almost hear palms being smacked against foreheads in unison throughout the West Wing. \u201cI\u2019ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach and they lived in Palm Beach,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI wish her well,\u201d he repeated.\n\nAD\n\nUsing a nationally televised briefing from the White House to offer good wishes to the accused procurer for a convicted sex criminal?

His Five O\u2019Clock Follies returned at their original hour \u2014 \u201ca good slot,\u201d Trump explained.

But it\u2019s a difficult act to maintain for Trump, even over a half-hour-long news conference.\n\nAD\n\nABC News\u2019s Jonathan Karl asked about White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s claim hours earlier that Trump is tested \u201cmultiple times a day\u201d for the virus.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any time I\u2019ve taken two tests in one day,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump was asked about the contradiction between his new claim that \"it will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better\u201d and his previous claim that the virus would \u201cdisappear.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe virus will disappear \u2014 it will disappear,\u201d Trump reprised.\n\nDoes he want Americans to judge him on the ballot in November by how he has handled the pandemic?\n\nTrump replied that \u201cnext year\u2019s going to be a record year and I think they\u2019re going to judge me on that.\u201d He then went into a long, unbidden boast about taxes, regulations and \u201cVeterans Choice.\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018choice,\u2019 \u201d he explained.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s call for mask-wearing would be more persuasive if he were wearing a mask himself, or if he had worn one at a fundraising event at his Trump International Hotel Monday night after tweeting a photo calling mask-wearing \u201cpatriotic.\u201d\n\nAsked about the mixed message, Trump pulled a presidential-seal mask out of his hip pocket. He explained that he puts it on in close quarters to protect others. \u201cAnything that potentially can help \u2014 and that certainly can potentially help \u2014 is a good thing,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThis is the right thing to say.

Trump has fundamentally reset America\u2019s relationship with the Chinese Communist Party, and in a series of recent speeches by national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray and Attorney General William P. Barr, a hardheaded realism about the CCP has been laid out in detail. This Thursday, at the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, Calif. (where I serve as the president of the Nixon Foundation), Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to deliver a definitive statement of Trump\u2019s policy toward Beijing. The last rites over a once-dramatic opening to China will be delivered on a stage 100 yards from Nixon\u2019s grave.\n\nTrump will again run on a platform of America first, and on rebuilding the economy he built once until it was shuttered by the novel coronavirus. Trump will point to his build-up of the military budget, his clear-eyed view of the CCP, a growing Navy, the Space Force, the revitalized nuclear deterrent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump will run on his massive deregulation, which will allow the economy to rebound rather than be bound up by the regulatory Lilliputians he has swept aside with the repeal of hundreds of regulations embodied in tens of thousands of Federal Register pages. Trump will run toward his handling of the coronavirus as well, citing again and again his decision to restrict travel from China in late January.\n\nDemocrats were late to the bell. On Jan. 31, the same day that Trump imposed restrictions on travel from China, Biden blasted Trump, saying, \u201cWe have, right now, a crisis with the coronavirus. This is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia \u2014 hysterical xenophobia \u2014 and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) visited San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown. \u201cEverything is fine here,\" Pelosi said. \u201cCome because precautions have been taken. The city is on top of the situation.\u201d As late as April 1, The Post published an article with the headline \u201cNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s repeated comments downplaying the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s blunt pummeling of opponents provides his opponents with an aesthetic argument against him that boils down to: He\u2019s just not nice enough to be president. Their arguments about his \u201cthreat to the Constitution\u201d are absurd. Trump has appointed justices and judges faithful to the Constitution. President Barack Obama is the president who ignored the document with wild theories about, to cite just two examples, recess appointments and wholesale suspensions of the laws governing immigration. Trump is the constitutionalist; Biden leads the radicals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn often hysterical media endlessly chants the same anti-Trump refrains. But voters have to ask themselves: Which man do they want squaring off against Xi Jinping, rebuilding the economy, appointing judges, funding the military?", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/21/trump-will-run-his-handling-coronavirus-china/", "author": ["Hugh Hewitt", "Contributing Columnist"]}, {"title": "Opinion | Trump wants to be king. Did John Yoo just hand him the crown?", "text": "Yoo\u2019s argument, in National Review, goes like this: President Barack Obama lacked the legal authority to implement, by executive fiat, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to protect from deportation dreamers brought to the United States as children. The Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., joined by the liberal justices, found that while Trump had the authority to revoke DACA, he hadn\u2019t gone through the proper administrative procedures to do so lawfully.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThus, Yoo argues, \u201cSuppose President Donald Trump decided to create a nationwide right to carry guns openly. He could declare that he would not enforce federal firearms laws, and that a new \u2018Trump permit\u2019 would free any holder of state and local gun-control restrictions.\u201d\n\nUnder Roberts\u2019s approach, \u201cEven if Trump knew that his scheme lacked legal authority, he could get away with it for the length of his presidency. And, moreover, even if courts declared the permit illegal, his successor would have to keep enforcing the program for another year or two.\u201d\n\nExpanding on this fantasy in Newsweek, Yoo adds that under the ruling, \u201cTrump could unilaterally cut income taxes by 50 percent, accelerate infrastructure projects and cut red tape for starting new businesses. He could create a \u2018recovery permit\u2019 that would give businesses the right to sidestep agency red tape, burdensome environmental regulations and onerous obstacles to opening new enterprises.\u201d All, says Yoo, because \u201caccording to the Supreme Court\u2019s DACA opinion, presidents now can use their prosecutorial discretion to set the enforcement level for any federal law at zero.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is ridiculous. Yoo dismisses DACA as \u201cillegal presidential action,\u201d which is mighty rich coming from someone who concluded that the president, as chief executive, could not be bound by a criminal statute outlawing torture \u2014 indeed, could order the massacre of a village of civilians.\n\nYes, before Obama formulated DACA, he acknowledged limits on his power to act. \u201cI\u2019m president, I\u2019m not king,\u201d he said at one point. But in crafting the program, Obama relied on a careful opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel detailing how he could \u2014 and couldn\u2019t \u2014 use prosecutorial discretion to defer immigration enforcement. The opinion emphasizes what the Supreme Court has described as \u201cthe broad discretion exercised by immigration officials\u201d; it is confined to that context. In any event, a president has the sworn constitutional duty to faithfully execute the law, not to, as in Yoo\u2019s fanciful hypotheticals, knowingly violate it.\n\nNo matter. Trump appears poised to out-Yoo Yoo. The law professor, at least, was warning of the dangers, as he saw it, of the Roberts opinion. Trump is taking Yoo as a potential road map for executive lawlessness. According to Axios, Yoo\u2019s National Review piece has been \u201cspotted atop Trump\u2019s desk in the Oval Office,\u201d and the president \u201chas brought up the article with key advisers.\u201d Yoo told the Guardian that he has been consulting with White House officials on the matter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd so there was Trump, on Fox News Sunday, law-splaining to Chris Wallace: \u201cWe\u2019re signing a health-care plan within two weeks, a full and complete health-care plan that the Supreme Court decision on DACA gave me the right to do. So we\u2019re going to solve \u2014 we\u2019re going to sign an immigration plan, a health-care plan, and various other plans . . . The Supreme Court gave the president of the United States powers that nobody thought the president had, by approving, by doing what they did \u2014 their decision on DACA.\u201d\n\nPowers that nobody thought the president had, indeed. For good reason \u2014 the president doesn\u2019t have them. Obama acknowledged he wasn\u2019t king. Trump, of course, would like to be.

Trump should be raising the bar for Biden, talking about what an experienced debater Biden is, having participated in so many debates during his more than four decades as a politician in Washington. If Trump continues to dismiss him as incompetent, all Biden will have to do to win is string together a few coherent sentences.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSecond, mocking Biden\u2019s decline is offensive to seniors. In 2016, Trump won seniors by nine points, but today, Trump is losing among seniors by six points in key battleground states. His push to reopen the economy has many older Americans spooked, because they are most vulnerable to the novel coronavirus and least concerned about bringing back jobs quickly since most are retired. Instead of helping win these voters back, making fun of Biden\u2019s mental functions further alienates them. Many struggle with memory problems themselves.

Instead of telling people Biden is not competent, let Biden continue to show it. The former vice president will misspeak a lot in the coming weeks and months.

As I walked around my neighborhood in the early evenings, I\u2019d pass houses with cars packed into their driveways. The sounds of Pitbull and J Balvin blared through the tropical shrubbery \u2014 a sure sign of a Miami house party.\n\nA month later, Miami has become the pandemic\u2019s epicenter. Miami-Dade County\u2019s intensive-care units and emergency departments are jammed. Specialists unaccustomed to managing critically ill patients are being called into action. The state has sent 100 additional health workers, mostly nurses, to the county\u2019s large public hospital to help its exhausted staff.\n\nAD\n\nI see patients in one of the hospital\u2019s primary-care clinics. Recently, a colleague started her week as ward attending by being called to a code, one of several occurring simultaneously in different parts of the hospital; a middle-aged woman recovering from the coronavirus had suddenly gone into cardiac arrest. Other colleagues have been intubating physically fit young people who precipitously went into respiratory failure.\n\nAD\n\nThis is what happens when your state becomes a national embarrassment. And the reason is clear: We have suffered from failures of political leadership at every level.\n\nFlorida\u2019s challenges are similar to those that New York and other northern states faced months ago. But while leaders in those states took aggressive action and modeled good behavior, our state has been significantly more laissez-faire and chaotic. Bars and restaurants closed for indoor service in March but reopened in June; now, Miami-Dade County\u2019s mayor has shut them down again. Opening business might have worked if our state and local officials had enforced the correct wearing of appropriate masks, or modeled good mask-wearing behavior themselves, or provided businesses with instructions on maintaining proper ventilation. But they didn\u2019t.\n\nAD\n\nCovid-19 testing is woefully inadequate, and the lucky folks who can actually score an appointment at one of the state\u2019s free testing sites, such as Marlins Park, are waiting more than a week to receive their results. The perpetually underfunded and politically influenced Florida Department of Health lacks enough staff to adequately trace all the people who test positive. Our leaders should have developed a robust public-health infrastructure capable of supporting contact tracing and quarantine enforcement long ago. They didn\u2019t, and scrambling to assemble these systems in the midst of a pandemic is too little, too late.\n\nAD\n\nIronically, I feel safer at work, where everyone wears masks correctly and takes proper precautions, than I do out in public. We still have adequate personal protective equipment \u2014 for now \u2014 and are not yet forced to wear garbage bags and rain ponchos like our colleagues in New York. But many staff are already calling in sick, and we worry we won\u2019t have enough nurses, respiratory therapists and doctors to manage the continuing deluge. And still young medical trainees tell me they see crowds of people, many without masks, congregating in the trendy areas of Miami Beach and in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\nIn a rational world, the federal government would help us test more people, faster; state and federal leaders would set an example by wearing masks correctly and consistently; local officials would strictly enforce quarantine rules; someone would slap warning labels on those awful ubiquitous online ads for valved masks; and our public health departments would be guided by health experts, not politicians. But this is Florida, a state with a well-established history of being anything but rational.\n\nAD\n\nSo for now, the state\u2019s citizens continue to muddle through. My fellow physicians and I are trying to stay on top of a fast-changing situation, while also keeping an eye on hurricane season.

Those numbers smash records set just last year, as I lay out in a recent report. Previously, the most mass shootings ever seen in one month was 51, set in June 2019.

From 2013 to 2019, states with weaker laws had 5 percent more mass-shooting incidents (though it was not statistically significant) and 50 percent more mass-shooting fatalities than states with stronger laws.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe disparity in deaths between strong- and weak-law states can be explained in part by the use of assault-style weapons, such as AR-15s and AK-47s. States with weak laws had 63 percent more mass shootings with such weapons than states with stronger laws. Despite comprising just 5 percent of overall mass shootings, shootings with these weapons were four times more lethal than shootings in which other types of firearms were used. Further, of the top 20 highest-casualty shootings across the country, 14 were committed with an assault weapon.\n\nWe are a country on the brink of a gun violence crisis. While our national attention has been rightfully fixated on the covid-19 catastrophe, we have largely ignored the increase in gun violence and mass shootings. This is a public health crisis and requires a data-driven, comprehensive public health approach.\n\nPrevious academic research has found that firearm licensing laws are not only effective at reducing overall rates of firearm violence, but also at directly curbing the frequency of mass shootings. Extreme risk protection orders are another promising policy that, if implemented and enacted properly, could also prevent potential mass shooters from arming themselves. Strong gun laws save lives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the research also tells us that one program or policy cannot stop the surge of violence on its own. To stop the rapid advance down this path of mass gun violence, we need to enact a comprehensive package of firearm laws and programs that are based on data, fact and best practices \u2014 not emotion or anecdote. Effective public policy requires our leaders to listen to data and to science. That is the only way we can stop this crisis from continuing to escalate.\n\nThe data and research only provide a glimpse into the devastation that mass shootings wrought in communities throughout our country. Each of these statistics represent horrific incidents that cut lives short and irreparably harmed others; tragedies that shatter families and communities again and again. No statistic can fully capture the trauma these shootings inflict, and mass shootings are just one part of America\u2019s ongoing gun violence epidemic.\n\nHow can the United States continue to call itself a world leader when we can\u2019t even end the violence on our own streets? It\u2019s time that we listen to the data and stop the violence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWatch Opinions videos:", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/21/2020-is-shattering-gun-violence-records-we-must-act/", "author": ["Devin Hughes"]}, {"title": "\u2018We thought it was a war out here\u2019: 14 people shot outside Chicago funeral home", "text": "One person has been taken in by police for questioning, but no arrests have been made in the case, First Deputy Superintendent Eric Carter said at a news conference.

Compared with this time last year, shootings in the city are up 47 percent, going from 1,110 in 2019 to 1,637 now, according to Chicago Police Department data. Homicides have increased by 51 percent, spiking from 275 at this time in 2019 to 414 as of Sunday.\n\nThe Tuesday night shooting was Chicago\u2019s worst in recent years.

That to me is disgusting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the statement to The Post, Yamaguma explained that the temporary painting had been \u201callowed as an extension of City efforts to preserve art related to the peaceful Black Lives Matter protests in Redwood City,\u201d and was also intended to complement a recently commissioned chalk mural in same area.\n\n\u201cThe painting was informally processed, and intended for a short duration,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Pease told KPIX over the weekend that he was aware of the artwork\u2019s limited life span, he said he was still disappointed.\n\n\u201cBecause we were using the poster board paint that would eventually deteriorate over time, my understanding from them was that the mural would last as long as the paint lasted,\u201d he said.\n\nThe news that the city would be erasing the giant message was swiftly met with outcry.

Mike DeWine, called on the lawmaker to resign.\n\n\u201cBecause of the nature of these charges, it will be impossible for Speaker Householder to effectively lead the Ohio House of Representatives,\u201d DeWine wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is a sad day for Ohio.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile leaving federal court Tuesday, the speaker told a reporter for WSYX that he does not plan to leave office.\n\nThe complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, said Householder and his associates campaigned for the bailout in exchange for hefty payments they used to fund his bid for speaker, enrich themselves and hide their scheme.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is likely the largest bribery, money laundering scheme ever perpetrated against the people of the state of Ohio,\u201d U.S. Attorney David DeVillers said at a news conference. \u201cThis was bribery, plain and simple. This was a quid pro quo. This was pay to play.\u201d\n\nBesides Householder, four others \u2014 his adviser Jeffrey Longstreth, former Ohio Republican Party chair Matt Borges, and lobbyists Neil Clark and Juan Cespedes \u2014 were each charged with a racketeering conspiracy and taken into custody Tuesday. They each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\nAD\n\nThe lawmaker, who represents a district east of Columbus, first arrived at the state House more than two decades ago. He was elected as House speaker in 2001, and stepped down almost four years later due to term limits. At the time, he and several aides were being investigated for possible money laundering. The federal probe was closed without any charges being filed.\n\nAD\n\nAfter winning his old seat back in 2016, his profile shot up quickly. Amid infighting among Ohio Republicans, he embarked on a multimillion-dollar bid for the speaker\u2019s gavel less than two years later.\n\nDeVillers, the U.S. attorney, said there was a \u201cstrong inference\u201d in the complaint that the alleged bribery scheme began when Householder reached out to FirstEnergy during his campaign, rather than the other way around.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis enterprise went looking for someone to bribe them,\u201d DeVillers said.\n\nFirstEnergy, which was struggling to compete with cleaner, newer energy sources, appeared to be a promising target. Already facing a grim future, the utility had been engaging in talks with state officials over a possible bailout for its coal and nuclear plants.\n\nThat\u2019s where Householder came in to help. In the 2018 election cycle, millions in the company\u2019s funds bankrolled the campaigns of 21 state House candidates, the complaint said. DeVillers called the group \u201cTeam Householder\u201d because they helped push the politician across the finish line in his race for speaker.\n\nAD\n\nThose lawmakers also proved instrumental in helping FirstEnergy. In July 2019, all but one voted for House Bill 6, which included the nuclear bailout and also slashed subsidies for renewable energy, prosecutors said.\n\nAD\n\nAs consumer advocates and the natural gas industry started a referendum last summer to challenge the law, a nonprofit political group called Generation Now launched a forceful campaign to quash that effort, including hiring people to intimidate petition canvassers. Among dozens of mailers and TV ads, one warned that China was trying to take over Ohio\u2019s power system, the complaint said.\n\nProsecutors say it was another part of the plot. Generation Now was an \u201centity secretly controlled by Householder,\u201d the complaint said, receiving payments \u201cakin to bags of cash\u201d that, unlike regular campaign contributions, were \u201cnot regulated, not reported, not subject to public scrutiny.\"\n\nAD\n\nOf the $63 million involved in the alleged scheme, as much as $38 million went to the nonprofit. The company also wired $500,000 into Householder\u2019s personal accounts, including more than $100,000 that was spent on the speaker\u2019s residence in Florida, the complaint said.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement to The Washington Post, a spokesperson for Energy Harbor said it was reviewing the complaint and would cooperate with government investigators.\n\nTuesday\u2019s arrests are only just the start for the corruption saga. Ohio\u2019s secretary of state, Frank LaRose said he had alerted the state\u2019s elections commission over 19 possible violations of campaign finance law tied to the alleged scheme.

She\u2019s old enough to understand the risks of facing off with heavily armed police officers, Noriega said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut we talked about that and I said, \u2018Sometimes we have to be brave and do the right thing even when it feels scary,\u2019 \u201d Noriega said.\n\nAs Rachel Weishaar, 34, was preparing to leave her home on Tuesday, she said, her 3-year-old offered this wish for her mother\u2019s safety: \u201cTell the police officers to be more gentle,\u201d the girl said.\n\nWeishaar carried her daughter\u2019s words on a sign she held outside the federal courthouse.\n\nThe night before, hundreds of moms joined to sing a lullaby outside the Multnomah County Justice Center, the site of the county jail and police headquarters. The lyrics were simple: \u201cHands up, please don\u2019t shoot me.\u201d\n\nThough the Wall of Moms has become an overnight Internet sensation, the group has also attracted skepticism. Some scholars and racial justice activists have criticized the group and the attention it has attracted for centering the voices of mostly white mothers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBlack mothers have been calling for criminal justice reform and racial equity for many years. They have lost sons and daughters at the hands of police. A group of seven mothers who have lost African American children to police action or gun violence, known as the Mothers of the Movement, have toured around the United States to protests and conferences. But they have never gone viral quite like the Wall of Moms.\n\nWall of Mom organizers said they want to help amplify the voices of mothers like these \u2014 mothers who have suffered losses and who have for years fought for systemic change in police practices.\n\n\u201cWhen you have the privilege that we have as white women, you have to use it for good, and I hope that that\u2019s what this is,\u201d said Vinson, who is white. \u201cI think it\u2019s really, really important that we gain the trust of the black community here and that\u2019s going to take some work, because we haven\u2019t always been dependable. We have an obligation to be humble, to listen and center black voices.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVinson, a cancer survivor who joined about 50 other moms at their first rally on Saturday night, said the moms continue to show up for as long as the protests go on.\n\nShe was joined Tuesday by her husband, Scott Vinson, 42, donning an orange T-shirt that has been adopted as the uniform for Portland\u2019s emerging dad activists, known collectively as the PDX Dad Pod or DadBloc.\n\nWhile the moms chanted and sang in the face of wafting tear gas, a dad in orange strolled toward the cloud of gas with a leaf blower slung over his right arm. He turned it on and blew the fumes away, back toward advancing law enforcement officers.", "link": "https://washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/22/portland-moms-protests/?tid=pm_pop&itid=pm_pop", "author": ["Marissa J.

Staff members wore masks with one-way valves, allowing their breath to escape as they told customers the cost of fixing their clunkers. And no one was enforcing limits on the number of customers who could enter the reception area while waiting for their repairs.\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the repair shop. As I walked around my neighborhood in the early evenings, I\u2019d pass houses with cars packed into their driveways. The sounds of Pitbull and J Balvin blared through the tropical shrubbery \u2014 a sure sign of a Miami house party.\n\nA month later, Miami has become the pandemic\u2019s epicenter. Miami-Dade County\u2019s intensive-care units and emergency departments are jammed. Specialists unaccustomed to managing critically ill patients are being called into action. The state has sent 100 additional health workers, mostly nurses, to the county\u2019s large public hospital to help its exhausted staff.\n\nAD\n\nI see patients in one of the hospital\u2019s primary-care clinics. Recently, a colleague started her week as ward attending by being called to a code, one of several occurring simultaneously in different parts of the hospital; a middle-aged woman recovering from the coronavirus had suddenly gone into cardiac arrest. Other colleagues have been intubating physically fit young people who precipitously went into respiratory failure.\n\nAD\n\nThis is what happens when your state becomes a national embarrassment. And the reason is clear: We have suffered from failures of political leadership at every level.\n\nFlorida\u2019s challenges are similar to those that New York and other northern states faced months ago. But while leaders in those states took aggressive action and modeled good behavior, our state has been significantly more laissez-faire and chaotic. Bars and restaurants closed for indoor service in March but reopened in June; now, Miami-Dade County\u2019s mayor has shut them down again. Opening business might have worked if our state and local officials had enforced the correct wearing of appropriate masks, or modeled good mask-wearing behavior themselves, or provided businesses with instructions on maintaining proper ventilation. But they didn\u2019t.\n\nAD\n\nCovid-19 testing is woefully inadequate, and the lucky folks who can actually score an appointment at one of the state\u2019s free testing sites, such as Marlins Park, are waiting more than a week to receive their results. The perpetually underfunded and politically influenced Florida Department of Health lacks enough staff to adequately trace all the people who test positive. Our leaders should have developed a robust public-health infrastructure capable of supporting contact tracing and quarantine enforcement long ago. They didn\u2019t, and scrambling to assemble these systems in the midst of a pandemic is too little, too late.\n\nAD\n\nIronically, I feel safer at work, where everyone wears masks correctly and takes proper precautions, than I do out in public. We still have adequate personal protective equipment \u2014 for now \u2014 and are not yet forced to wear garbage bags and rain ponchos like our colleagues in New York. But many staff are already calling in sick, and we worry we won\u2019t have enough nurses, respiratory therapists and doctors to manage the continuing deluge. And still young medical trainees tell me they see crowds of people, many without masks, congregating in the trendy areas of Miami Beach and in Miami\u2019s Brickell neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\nIn a rational world, the federal government would help us test more people, faster; state and federal leaders would set an example by wearing masks correctly and consistently; local officials would strictly enforce quarantine rules; someone would slap warning labels on those awful ubiquitous online ads for valved masks; and our public health departments would be guided by health experts, not politicians. But this is Florida, a state with a well-established history of being anything but rational.\n\nAD\n\nSo for now, the state\u2019s citizens continue to muddle through. My fellow physicians and I are trying to stay on top of a fast-changing situation, while also keeping an eye on hurricane season. In the absence of responsible leadership, we doubt Florida will stop setting records \u2014 of the wrong kind \u2014 anytime soon.\n\nRead more:", "link": "https://washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/21/im-doctor-miami-heres-how-i-know-floridas-covid-19-outbreak-wont-improve-anytime-soon/?tid=pm_pop&itid=pm_pop", "author": ["Erin N.

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who according to multiple officials was incensed at the push to boost spending levels, asked his colleagues at the lunch with the administration negotiators, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the exchange.\n\nThe whole process now appears likely to spill into August, something the White House and congressional Democrats had hoped to avoid, because it would mean more than 20 million Americans would lose emergency unemployment benefits when they expire at the end of this month. They have not mapped out a plan for what would happen to these people as the pandemic\u2019s turmoil continues to weigh on the U.S. economy.\n\nPart of the problem stemmed from the White House\u2019s failure to go into the talks with a preset strategy or a list of proposals that they knew GOP lawmakers would rally behind. This miscalculation created immediate problems. Numerous demands the White House had tried to formulate over the weekend were erased within hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday that the goal was to keep the spending bill around $1 trillion, but by Tuesday he had abandoned that. White House officials also indicated they would no longer push for cuts to testing and the CDC. And after a barrage of criticism of Trump\u2019s tax cut demand, White House officials stopped trying to press the matter.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to spend what we need to spend, and we\u2019re going to make sure we don\u2019t spend more than that,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nDemocrats pointed fingers at the Republican infighting and said the White House and GOP leaders were unprepared to handle the country\u2019s mounting economic and health care challenges. House Democrats passed a $3 trillion spending bill in May that would send another round of stimulus checks, provide more money to states and help hospitals, among other things, but the White House has vowed to block it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRepublicans are in complete disarray,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. \u201cTotally incompetent. Totally in disarray. Totally at war with one another.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to bridge differences, Mnuchin, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow met with Senate Republicans over lunch. But that led to little progress, as Republicans made clear to Mnuchin and Meadows that they were not supportive of Trump\u2019s insistence on a payroll tax cut or curbed funding for coronavirus tests and the CDC.\n\nRepublicans do appear to be gravitating toward a proposal on what to do about the expiring unemployment benefits, however. In March, Congress approved an additional $600 weekly benefit through the end of July for unemployed Americans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats have proposed extending those benefits through January, but the White House and some Republicans now want to cut the extra benefits to about $200 per week. Democrats haven\u2019t agreed to this, however.\n\nRepublicans were finding a harder time coming to a consensus on many other issues. Mnuchin on Monday had insisted the payroll tax idea was in the bill, but he didn\u2019t even bring it up during the lunch as the opposition snowballed, two people briefed on the interaction said.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t reached a conclusion on anything,\u201d Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said when the lunch ended.\n\nMeadows acknowledged the discontent, telling reporters, \u201cWell as you can imagine, any time you have Senate Republicans there, you have a number of different thoughts on what should or should not happen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nUnderlying the confusion surrounding the GOP stimulus package are tensions among Trump administration officials about their priorities.\n\nTrump is being represented on Capitol Hill by Mnuchin and Meadows, a tandem that hasn\u2019t brokered a deal jointly with Congress before. Trump has for months privately worried that Mnuchin, his chief negotiator with Democrats, was giving away too much to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), leading conservative lawmakers to push for Meadows to have a more active role in this round of talks. Before joining the White House, Meadows was a congressman and leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Mnuchin, meanwhile, has a background as a banker and a Hollywood producer with few ties to the conservative movement.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, Meadows sat toward the back of the room and deferred to Mnuchin as he led the conversation with the GOP senators, according to two people aware of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. Mnuchin discussed the importance of sending another round of stimulus checks and providing more money for the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nAD\n\nMnuchin also told reporters it was important for lawmakers to reach an agreement before the supplemental increase in unemployment benefits runs out by the end of this month. Republican lawmakers, including Trump, have consistently bashed that benefit increase because they think it makes it more lucrative for workers to stay home than reenter the labor market, but Mnuchin stressed the importance of providing some financial cushion for the jobless.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to try to get something done before the enhanced unemployment insurance expires. There\u2019s a lot of people who are still out of work,\u201d Mnuchin said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters, though, that it was very unlikely a deal would be reached by the end of next week, laughing and saying no when asked whether that was possible.\n\nAD\n\nOne area the White House appeared to be shifting its position on was whether to include more money for coronavirus testing. Over the weekend, the White House had opposed new money for testing, but Senate Republicans pushed back. On Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said the administration would seek \u201ctargeted\u201d money for testing, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re willing to put in money for targeted testing that makes sense, not just dumping money into a pot that contains $10 billion.\u201d\n\nThese programs are just one part of what the administration and McConnell had envisioned as a $1 trillion package that is likely to be the last major coronavirus relief bill before the election. But the price tag appeared to be growing.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans have spent much of the past several days clashing over how to handle Trump\u2019s demand for a payroll tax cut plan. Mnuchin and Meadows were met with so much blowback to the idea at the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday that Mnuchin didn\u2019t try to persuade anyone to reconsider, several attendees said.\n\nAD\n\nHe was also confronted by multiple complaints about the size of the emerging package, with some lawmakers who had voted for the $2 trillion Cares Act in March saying they couldn\u2019t support the new package if it were to exceed $1 trillion.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) argued against the payroll tax cut, making the case that no voters would notice the tax relief and that he was skeptical that the policy changes could even be implemented before October.\n\nAD\n\nElectoral politics were also in consideration at the lunch. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) urged other GOP senators to be attentive to what Republicans in competitive reelection bids are hearing on the ground from voters, and he made the case that if the GOP loses the majority, Democrats in control will implement policies that are much more costly to the national debt. So spending a bit more money now in a rescue bill that would aid Republicans in their races would be cheaper in the long run, he argued. Cotton is also up for reelection in November but is not considered to be in a competitive race.\n\nAD\n\nCotton\u2019s viewpoint appeared to clash with that of Cruz, who vigorously warned against spending too much money in the package and said it could lead to a revolt among conservative voters in November.\n\nCruz said the GOP should be focused on a safe restart of the economy. He said if the economy remains shuttered in November, Democrats will win both the White House and the Senate and that Republican senators, who usually meet in the ornate Mansfield Room in the Capitol, will \u201cbe meeting in a much smaller lunchroom\u201d next year.\n\nMcConnell did provide some details of what he hoped would be an eventual GOP package. He said it would include $105 billion to help schools reopen, another round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, more stimulus checks to individual Americans, incentives for hiring and retaining workers, and reimbursement for businesses to establish safety measures.\n\n\u201cThe American job market needs another shot of adrenaline,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cSenate Republicans are laser-focused on getting American workers their jobs back.\u201d\n\nTrump has already enacted four laws that provided close to $3 trillion in new tax cuts and spending to try to help the economy and health-care system navigate the coronavirus pandemic. The economy remains weak, however, with an unemployment rate of 11.1 percent and millions of people collecting unemployment benefits. Lawmakers are split over what to do next. When he was heading into a meeting with Senate appropriators, Meadows was asked about the highest price tag they could agree to.", "link": "https://washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/21/coronavirus-trump-congress-stimulus/?tid=pm_pop&itid=pm_pop", "author": ["Erica Werner", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On Economic Policy", "Jeff Stein", "Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter"]}, {"title": "U.S. and Britain change diplomatic immunity rules in light of Harry Dunn death", "text": "In August, Harry Dunn, 19, was killed when police say his motorcycle was struck by a car driven by Anne Sacoolas.\n\nSacoolas, an American official\u2019s wife, admitted to driving on the wrong side of the road last August when she collided with Dunn.

She was always packing and unpacking for foreign posts, for the war zones where she fought enemy combatants at ground level and for the stateside assignments where she has ended up in another type of fight with her former colleagues.\n\nAD\n\nSpletstoser, who rose to the rarefied rank of full-bird colonel before retiring in 2019, fashioned herself as a fixer of broken things \u2014 systems and underperforming units and cultures. She still sees herself that way.\n\nAD\n\nWhat Spletstoser and her supporters perceive as broken, others see as whole, sturdy and vital: the parallel justice systems that generally seal the grievances of military personnel inside the confines of military institutions, and the legal doctrines and rulings that have long blocked service members from suing superior officers in civilian courts for claims deemed to be related to their military service, including sexual assault.\n\nFor Spletstoser, 52, embarking on what could be seen as her latest fix-it job has meant challenging one of America\u2019s most powerful men \u2014 four-star General John E. Hyten. He is the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military\u2019s second-highest-ranking officer, and has recently been coordinating the military response to coronavirus pandemic as co-chair of Defense Department\u2019s covid-19 task force.\n\nAD\n\nSpletstoser has accused Hyten of sexually assaulting her more than half a dozen times while she was under his command and then retaliating against her \u2014 accusations that he has vigorously denied during a military investigation and in front of the U.S. Senate.\n\nAD\n\nHyten declined interview requests for this story. At his confirmation hearing last year, he said that he wanted to state \u201cin the strongest possible terms that these allegations are false.\u201d He cited a \u201cvery extensive, thorough investigation\u201d that he said \u201crevealed the truth: Nothing happened ever.\u201d\n\nHyten and his attorneys have overstated the results of the Air Force\u2019s investigation, saying it found Spletstoser\u2019s allegations to be \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d In fact, the investigation \u2014 which was triggered by a complaint Spletstoser filed with the Air Force in April 2019 \u2014 neither supported her version of events or completely exonerated Hyten.\n\nAD\n\nThe investigation ended without a determination of \u201cguilt or innocence\u201d or a conclusion about whether Spletstoser\u2019s allegations had been \u201csubstantiated or unsubstantiated,\u201d according to the Air Force\u2019s announcement when the investigation report was publicly released. The case did not move forward because the Air Force general in charge of reviewing the investigation determined there was \u201cinsufficient\u201d evidence to charge him or recommend administrative action, according to the Air Force statement.\n\nAD\n\nSpletstoser also brought her complaint to the Senate, which didn\u2019t think enough of her accusations to prevent Hyten\u2019s confirmation as vice chairman.\n\nSo now, she turns to a federal court in Los Angeles, where a victory in a sexual assault lawsuit she filed against Hyten, which reached a critical juncture Monday when a federal judge in Los Angeles heard arguments on Hyten\u2019s attempt to dismiss the suit, would be the equivalent of a major legal earthquake that could possibly set precedent for other service members, permitting them to sue their commanders in federal court for damages.\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, on the other side of the country, Spletstoser is meeting with members of Congress in hopes of persuading lawmakers to loosen the doctrine governing service members\u2019 access to the civilian courts in sexual assault cases.\n\nAD\n\nThey\u2019d be trying to overcome decades of legal precedents that have blocked suits, despite periodic efforts to overturn those rulings. The Justice Department attorneys representing Hyten have cited numerous rape and sexual assault cases that have been blocked over the years, including one in which the court said that \u201cwhile the acts of sexual harassment served no military purpose, they were incident to\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s military service. Another says \u201ceven sexual misconduct can be within the scope of employment\u201d in the military.\n\nSpletstoser says her lawsuit is \u201cabout equal justice under the law. Military members must be afforded equal opportunity in our judicial system, which they currently don\u2019t have. I want him to be held accountable for what he did.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNot long ago, she was talking to her brother \u2014 John Spletstoser, a federal law enforcement officer in the Midwest \u2014 who\u2019d encouraged her to use her voice and status as a former high-ranking officer with two bronze stars to inspire lower-ranked female service members who might be fearful of speaking up about sexual misdeeds.\n\nBut he also offered a dose of reality about what lies ahead: \u201cYou\u2019re fighting Goliath.\u201d\n\nTours of duty\n\nKathy Spletstoser wanted to \u201cblow things up.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe\u2019d had fun in her first foray into the military as an Army reservist rigging parachutes in the late 1980s.

They called themselves the \u201cFour Thirsty Worst.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut she wanted action.\n\nThis was no surprise to her sister, Jean Spletstoser, a deputy sheriff in Wisconsin, who remembers her as a \u201ctom boy,\u201d growing up in Eau Claire, Wis. They were raised by a nurse anesthetist mother working long hours after their parents divorced when she was a teenager. She\u2019d been a Catholic school jock, a force on the basketball court. She also did some modeling.\n\nBut the uniform of a soldier fit her better than the latest fashions.\n\n\u201cIt became your professional life, your social life,\u201d Spletstoser recalls. \u201cWhen it\u2019s at its best, it\u2019s very good.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMore than any place, the battlefield made sense to her.\n\nSides are clear. There are rules of engagement. Frissons of energy coursed through her, along with a sense of purpose.\n\nAD\n\nShe served four tours of combat duty in the early and mid-2000s, two each in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2005, her unit was ambushed outside Kandahar in Afghanistan, and she suffered what she describes as a severe concussion and a mild traumatic brain injury when her vehicle flipped.\n\nStill, she says, \u201cthe funnest times I\u2019ve had in my life have been in war.\u201d\n\n'A transformer, a fixer'\n\n\u201cWe have tribes in the Army,\u201d Spletstoser says one afternoon. \u201cI had not adhered to any particular tribe.\u201d\n\nIt was that way in 2011 when Spletstoser was sent to South Korea as a commanding officer overseeing more than 4,000 troops, with what she says was a straightforward mandate: shake things up and improve readiness of the U.S. troops based there.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy reputation is definitely as a transformer, a fixer, a results-driven person,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, that\u2019s good and bad. You love that or hate that. That can rub people the wrong way.\u201d\n\nAnd so it was just a bit of an odd fit in 2016 when Spletstoser was assigned as the director of the Commander\u2019s Action Group at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, where the U.S. Strategic Command manages the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal. There, she\u2019d be mixing with Air Force personnel, whom she perceived as less accustomed to the brusque Army style that came so naturally to her. Nonetheless, she earned glowing marks, according to copies of her evaluations.\n\nLess than a year after starting the job, she got a new boss, a tall, Harvard-educated, four-star general, John E. Hyten, who\u2019d made a name for himself in the Air Force\u2019s space operations. Spletstoser was leery. She considered him a \u201cdesk jockey\u201d with expertise in acquisitions and space but none of the on-the-ground war-fighting experience she had.\n\nAD\n\nShe says she \u201cquickly learned that he was exceedingly bright and he was willing to learn and he was willing to engage in a back-and-forth dialogue that leveraged both of our quick wits in a professional environment.\u201d\n\nAccording to Spletstoser, their professional relationship quickly took a turn. Not long after she began reporting to Hyten, Spletstoser alleges, he dismissed all the other staffers from a meeting in his hotel room while they were on a temporary duty assignment in Palo Alto, Calif., then grabbed her hand and placed it on his crotch. She alleges that she could feel his erect penis through his uniform pants.\n\nA few months later, on a work trip to Monterey, Calif., he summoned her to his hotel room for what she thought was a meeting, then tried to kiss her, she says. In the coming months, in locations as far-flung as Seoul, and Washington, D.C., she says Hyten grabbed her breasts or tried to kiss her, according to her lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI was confused by his behavior,\u201d Spletstoser says in an interview. \u201cIt was just a horrible, horrible feeling.\u201d\n\nShe was trying to preserve her career, she says, and didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\u201cI fear no man in battle,\u201d she says. But challenging a four-star general was different: \u201cThe reality is they have as much power as God.\u201d\n\nIn December 2017, according to Spletstoser\u2019s lawsuit, Hyten knocked on her hotel room door while they were attending the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif. Once inside, he pulled her toward him so she couldn\u2019t move and groped her, she says in her lawsuit. He told her something like, \u201cI want to make love to you.\u201d\n\nHe rubbed against her, Spletstoser says, and ejaculated in the workout shorts he was wearing. When she freed herself, he asked if she would report him, and \u2014 fearing retaliation \u2014 she said she wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThe month before the alleged assault in Simi Valley, Hyten had gushed to another officer about her promotion potential, according to Spletstoser\u2019s lawsuit. The month after the alleged assault, an internal investigation was launched into whether Spletstoser was a \u201ctoxic\u201d leader, the lawsuit says. The investigation, which was completed by a general who reported to Hyten, concluded she\u2019d \u201cbullied\u201d subordinates, was an \u201cinsensitive driven achiever\u201d and \u201ctoxic self-centered abuser\u201d \u2014 accusations she denies. Hyten relieved her from her position. Spletstoser believed it was pay back for rejecting his advances.\n\nHyten has denied wrongdoing. But the circumstances of the inquiry drew a reproach at Hyten\u2019s confirmation hearing from Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, who said he\u2019d failed to counsel Spletstoser about alleged complaints regarding her behavior and did nothing about them until questions about his own leadership were being raised. Ernst, the only GOP senator to vote against his confirmation, also noted that the investigation was not completed by an independent entity outside his chain of command.\n\nHyten had told Spletstoser he planned to retire, she said in an interview. She figured that there was no risk of Hyten engaging in the same type of alleged misconduct with other service members once he\u2019d retired, and she decided to take her allegations \u201cto the grave.\u201d\n\nShe had no idea that she would be going back to war in a few months.\n\nNot against al-Qaeda or the Taliban this time, but against a four-star general.\n\n'The machine takes over'\n\nIn April 2019, Spletstoser says, she learned that Hyten would be nominated by President Trump to be vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nWith Hyten remaining in the military, she decided to end her silence and filed a complaint that prompted an investigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations.\n\nAt first, the complaint was cathartic for Spletstoser. But the feeling didn\u2019t last.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much the machine takes over,\u201d she says. \u201cThe machine being the Department of Defense.\u201d\n\nCritics of the military\u2019s handling of sexual assault cases found much to alarm them in Spletstoser\u2019s case. The decision not to go forward with a court-martial of Hyten was made by another Air Force four-star general \u2014 part of a small and ultra-elite group of military leaders. The investigative interviews were also conducted by officers who were junior in rank to Hyten.\n\nA standard investigative technique \u2014 recording a phone call between the accused and the accuser \u2014 was conducted in less than ideal circumstances: while Hyten was in the car with his wife, an environment in which, presumably, he\u2019d be less forthcoming.\n\n\u201cIt was completely botched,\u201d said Don Christensen, a retired Air Force colonel who was the Air Force\u2019s chief prosecutor from 2010 to 2014 and is now president of \u201cProtect Our Defenders,\u201d a not-for-profit group focused on ending \u201can epidemic\u201d of military rape.\n\nOn the taped call, which was disclosed but not specifically quoted in the Air Force investigation report, Hyten had told Spletstoser something like, \u201cI have my eye on you,\u201d according to her lawsuit. She considered the remark threatening. He\u2019d taken a polygraph that his wife, Laura, told investigators was \u201cinconclusive\u201d and upset him, according to Spletstoser\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nLaura Hyten did not respond to an interview request made through her husband\u2019s office.\n\nStill, the investigation surfaced issues that could be problematic for Spletstoser, potentially undercutting her claim that her superiors unfairly retaliated against her during the investigation into her alleged \u201ctoxic leadership.\u201d While some witnesses were supportive, there were numerous others who made complaints about Spletstoser.\n\nShe was \u201cbitchy\u201d and \u201crough,\u201d witnesses said. Hyten called her \u201cbrilliant up but toxic down,\u201d according to the investigation report.\n\nHyten also raised questions about Spletstoser\u2019s mental health, saying she made threats alluding to the possibility she could harm him or herself, according to the investigation report. Spletstoser says her remarks, were misinterpreted, including emails in which she says, \u201cthe only one who gets to judge me now is God,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t plan on being around any longer.\u201d\n\nHyten\u2019s Justice Department attorneys and his congressional supporters have characterized the investigation as definitive and thorough, noting that 53 investigators took part, interviewing 63 people in three countries and 14 states, and reviewing 196,000 emails and 4,000 pages of documents.\n\nWhen a redacted version of the report was released in August, the Air Force noted that the special investigations office \u201cdoes not make a determination as to innocence, guilt, weight of the evidence, or whether to substantiate or unsubstantiate the allegations.\u201d The purpose of the investigations are to provide findings to the military\u2019s \u201ccourt martial convening authority,\u201d which decides whether to charge the accused, take administrative action or not move forward with the case.\n\nBut, in many instances, the results have been portrayed differently. Hyten\u2019s spokeswoman, Maj. Trisha Guillebeau, noting that the Air Force and Congress had conducted investigations, said in a statement to The Washington Post that the allegations were \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d but did not respond to a request to provide documentation to support that claim.\n\nOn the first page of the Justice Department\u2019s motion to dismiss Spletstoser\u2019s lawsuit, Hyten\u2019s attorneys state that the Air Force found her allegations to be \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d Reginald M. Skinner, a senior trial attorney on the case, did not respond to multiple emails saying The Post would specifically report that the statement appears to be in conflict with the Air Force\u2019s announcement accompanying the release of its investigation.\n\nSpletstoser\u2019s name became public during Hyten\u2019s confirmation hearings, and she believes that a person with whom she\u2019d previously worked leaked her name. Hyten declined to answer questions about whether he was involved in making Spletstoser\u2019s name public or knew who had.\n\nInside the hearing room, Sen. Martha McSally, (R-Ariz.), an Air Force veteran who has said she was raped while serving in the military but has not identified her assailant \u2014 declared that Hyten is \u201cinnocent.\u201d\n\nHer statement rankled Spletstoser\u2019s sister, Jean, who said McSally \u201cdidn\u2019t have the guts to name her perpetrator.\u201d\n\nMcSally did not respond to multiple interview requests.\n\nFormer Air Force secretary Heather Wilson, a Hyten supporter who oversaw the investigation of Spletstoser\u2019s allegation before leaving her post as secretary, told senators at the hearing that he\u2019d been \u201cfalsely accused.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is entirely possible that his accuser is a wounded soldier who believes what she is saying is true, even if it is not,\u201d said Wilson, a onetime congresswoman from New Mexico who is now the president of the University of Texas at El Paso.\n\nWilson declined to answer written questions from The Post about the basis for her unequivocal assertion that Hyten had been falsely accused or that wounds may have been a factor in Spletstoser\u2019s allegations against Hyten.\n\nA military protective order had been issued at Spletstoser\u2019s request against Hyten months earlier, according to a copy of the order included as an exhibit in her lawsuit. Spletstoser said she asked for the order, which states that it is not intended to indicate wrongdoing, because she felt threatened on the taped call, he knew where she lived, and she\u2019d been told by Air Force investigators that Hyten had been Googling her. Hyten did not respond to questions about the protective order.\n\nSix days after the order was lifted, the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Hyten.\n\nTwo months after that, Spletstoser left the Army.\n\nAn enormous hurdle\n\nSpletstoser didn\u2019t know what to do. But she knew she had to do something.\n\nShe ended up being referred to Ariel Solomon, an employment lawyer who splits her time between New York and Washington, and agreed to take her case pro bono along with several other lawyers. She gained more firepower when Ridgely Walsh chief executive Juleanna Glover, a well-connected Washington public affairs specialist who was formerly active in Republican politics but is now a supporter of Trump\u2019s 2020 Democratic opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, also signed on to provide pro bono services.\n\nIn November, Spletstoser filed her lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles against Hyten, seeking damages \u2014 and another chance to prove she wasn\u2019t lying.\n\nThe lawsuit has an enormous hurdle to clear. It\u2019s called the Feres doctrine, and it goes back to a 1950 Supreme Court decision related to government immunity from lawsuits. A core concept of the doctrine, as it has been applied by the courts, is that allowing subordinates to sue their superiors would undermine military discipline.\n\n\u201cThe military constitutes a specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian,\u201d Hyten\u2019s attorneys argue, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\nThe interpretation of what is related to \u2014 or more precisely \u201cincident to\u201d \u2014 military service has been broad, incorporating allegations that take place in uniform and out, on-base or off, anything \u201ceven remotely related\u201d to a person\u2019s status as a member of the military.\n\nLate Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once famously wrote that \u201cFeres was wrongly decided and heartily deserves the widespread, almost universal criticism it has received.\u201d\n\nAnd yet it has endured, vigorously defended by the military, despite criticism from activists such as Christensen, who has been a supporter of Spletstoser\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of bizarre world we live in that we view sexual assault by your superior as part of your military service,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an absurdity.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s defense of Hyten can basically be boiled down to the idea that even if he had committed the assaults, Spletstoser still couldn\u2019t sue him because he outranked her, and the alleged assaults took place while they were \u201con official assignment.\u201d\n\nSpletstoser hopes to persuade the courts that \u201cthere is nothing uniquely military\u201d about alleged assaults that took place in private hotel rooms.\n\nWhile waging their legal fight, Spletstoser and Solomon have been engaged in a parallel battle over records, including emails and investigation testimony, they say the Air Force and Defense Department refuse to provide. The Defense Department has argued that the records she\u2019s requesting are exempt from the federal Freedom of Information Act.\n\nSpletstoser believes the records, which she thinks could provide information helpful to her case, are being shielded because they contain material that would be damaging to Hyten\u2019s career.\n\nAs an example, she shared a snippet of her previously undisclosed testimony from one of her interviews with Air Force investigators that she believes is included in material that is not being released. It relates to a dinner attended by Hyten, President Trump and the first lady in October 2017.\n\n\u201cThe president is an idiot,\u201d Spletstoser says Hyten told her and other staffers, according to notes she says she took during a briefing on the meal and later provided to investigators. \u201cHe is just a businessman without the basic understanding of national security. Everything is a business transaction for him and making money is winning to him and the only thing that matters.\u201d\n\nHyten went on to say, according to Spletstoser\u2019s notes, that \u201cthe president wanted to sell nuclear-powered submarines to the South Koreans, and I had to talk him out of it, explaining why this was a bad idea. Everything is about a business deal \u2014 that is how the President views things, through that lens.\n\n\u201cI also spent a lot of time talking to Melania Trump about the locations of all our Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Fields. She was more inquisitive and smarter than the president.\u201d\n\nThe Post sent the full text of Spletstoser\u2019s notes to Hyten. He declined to comment.\n\n\u201cWe are unfamiliar with any conversation like this,\u201d said a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters related to how private conversations are conducted with the president. \u201cDiscussions like this would not be had casually around a dinner table.\u201d\n\nThis summer, Spletstoser could not believe her eyes when she saw an article posted to Military.com in which Hyten disclosed that he would create a high-ranking position to analyze programs, including those addressing sexual assault and domestic violence. He said he\u2019d gotten the idea from his daughter, who\u2019d attended his confirmation hearings.\n\nSpletstoser saw Hyten\u2019s plan as \u201cdisturbing and self-serving.\u201d\n\nBy then, Spletstoser had been living in a kind of netherworld for a long time, believing she\u2019s been blackballed from civilian government jobs. She stopped going to Washington Wizards basketball games for a while after some men in the audience recognized her and began making lewd comments behind her back.\n\nHer brother, John, detected a difference in her, a kind of fog, \u201clike there\u2019s something always on her mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not favorable for her, I hope she can move on,\u201d he said.\n\nSometimes, as she waits for a day in court, Spletstoser finds herself reflexively turning away when she passes the Pentagon, once a place that almost felt like home, a place she\u2019d returned to no matter how many times she\u2019d packed and unpacked.\n\n\u201cThe five-sided puzzle palace I never go in \u2014 I knew it inside and out,\u201d she says one afternoon. \u201cThe thought of going there.\u201d\n\nShe pauses, gathering her thoughts.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/retired-col-kathy-spletstoser-wasnt-able-to-stop-joint-chiefs-vice-chairman-gen-john-hyten-from-being-confirmed-but-shes-not-done-with-him/2020/07/21/47855cfa-a1c1-11ea-9590-1858a893bd59_story.html", "author": ["Manuel Roig-Franzia", "Feature Reporter"]}, {"title": "Where is my tax refund?

We are continuing to whittle away at our paper inventory.\u201d\n\nThe coronavirus-related chaos that has marred this year\u2019s tax season should give people who still mail paper tax returns additional incentive to switch to electronic filing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne reader, waiting on a $10,000 refund, said his tax preparer doesn\u2019t like e-filing returns.\n\n\u201cBig mistake,\u201d he emailed. \u201cNext time will hope my accountant of 40 years will do electronic filing or just retire. We filed a paper federal return on February 25. We are due a large refund. I got my Maryland state tax refund promptly (paper return) and can\u2019t tell if my federal return got lost in the mail. Stupid me, I did not send it certified. Or is it still sitting in a trailer waiting to be reviewed? I\u2019m not sure if the IRS \u2018penalizes\u2019 someone due a refund of several thousand dollars if the return just never got to them.\u201d\n\nThe agency began a phased reopening on June 1, with employees working to dig out from under a backlog of mail. \u201cEven now, we\u2019re still not at 100 percent staffing,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAD\n\nAs of the week ending July 4, the agency estimates that it had 7.8 million pieces of mail correspondence, which includes about 3.6 million unopened returns, Smith said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThese are not exact figures, and because both paper and electronic returns continue to come in, it\u2019s very much a moving target,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we don\u2019t yet have an estimated date of when the backlog will be completed.\u201d\n\nThe IRS remains scaled back to comply with social distancing recommendations. Still, in the week ending July 10, the agency processed more than 4 million returns compared to the previous week.\n\nAt least if you\u2019re getting a refund, your return gets priority treatment \u2014 whether your return arrived early in the year or during the typical spike around the filing deadline, which shifted to July 15 this year.\n\nAD\n\nThere are four key points to keep in mind if you\u2019re worried about when your return will be processed, or whether the IRS received it.\n\n\u2014 Even without receipt proof, it\u2019s very likely your return is in the backlog. But if you\u2019re unsure, don\u2019t file a second tax return or bother calling the IRS.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe completely sympathize with your concern that the IRS may not have received your return, especially when it comes to refunds,\u201d said Smith. \u201cRight now, sending in a follow-up letter or another copy of the return won\u2019t help, and in fact it will usually slow things down. It could take even longer to get your refund.\u201d\n\nAs of July 10, the average refund was $2,762.\n\n\u2014 Check the status of your refund by using the \u201cWhere\u2019s My Refund?\u201d tool at irs.gov/refunds or by calling 800-829-1954. But you don\u2019t have to check multiple times a day. The refund portal is only updated once a day, usually overnight.\n\nAD\n\nYou should call the IRS if it has been more than 21 days since you e-filed your return or you get a message while using the \u201cWhere\u2019s My Refund?\u201d tool to contact the IRS. Although phone lines supported by customer service representatives are open, expect long waits because of limited staffing.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 If you\u2019re due a refund, you\u2019ll get the full amount. There\u2019s no penalty assessed by the IRS even if the return is late. There is only a late-filing penalty if you owe.\n\n\u2014 There is a decent bonus for your wait. If you filed your tax return before July 15, you\u2019ll receive interest on your refund. The interest rate for the second quarter, which ended June 30, is 5 percent, compounded daily. After this date, the interest rate for the third quarter, ending Sept. 30, drops to 3 percent.\n\nAD\n\nThe interest accrues from April 15 to whenever the IRS issues your refund, and it comes in a separate check or direct deposit.\n\nAnd, in case you\u2019re wondering, yes, the interest is considered taxable income.\n\n***", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/21/tax-refund-delay-irs/", "author": ["Michelle Singletary", "Personal Finance Columnist"]}, {"title": "She had her dream job as a sideline reporter. An accident at Audi Field changed everything.", "text": "The summer of 2018 had been a whirlwind of excitement and activity. United had just signed Wayne Rooney, a bona fide international star who put the Major League Soccer team in newspaper headlines around the world. The organization had cut the ribbon on a much-anticipated stadium, Audi Field, and was poised to usher in a new era as one of the league\u2019s cornerstone franchises.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking right before the opener, like, this may be the best year of my life,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust before that first game, as Simpson was preparing to go on air, a long aluminum railing cover fell from the seating area overhead and came crashing down. The team told reporters Simpson was struck in the head and was off the night\u2019s broadcast. The incident created a minor social media stir before Rooney and his teammates took center stage, delivering an exciting victory to a raucous sellout crowd.\n\nSimpson says she doesn\u2019t remember any of it.\n\nJuly 14 marked the two-year anniversary of the accident, and Simpson is still struggling through her recovery while also locked in a legal battle with United and its insurance company over workers\u2019 compensation. Simpson, 34, says she suffered a head injury that profoundly changed everything. She since has had two surgeries as she tries to emerge from the fog.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe insurance company sent Simpson to a doctor who said she was never struck in the head that day at Audi Field. And even though her treating physicians were certain Simpson had suffered a concussion and was debilitated, the insurance company stopped paying her workers\u2019 compensation in September \u2014 14 months after the accident but before Simpson says she is close to being fully recovered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re fighting this tooth and nail at this point,\u201d said her attorney, David Schloss. \u201cCertainly, they\u2019re entitled to do that. We\u2019re surprised they\u2019d choose to do that in this case.\u201d\n\nEven though the team is named in the labor complaint Simpson filed, United contends the matter is really between Simpson and Great Divide Insurance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cD.C. United is not party to the workers\u2019 compensation matter and the club is not adverse to Ms. Simpson,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s our hope that the final outcome is just and we wish Ms. Simpson the best for her health and happiness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSchloss asserts that the team is an \u201cequal party\u201d and that it had the authority to instruct the insurance company to act differently. He says United could have nixed the independent medical review and ensured Simpson continued to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\n\nA spokesperson for Great Divide Insurance declined to comment, citing a company policy against publicly discussing any claims.\n\nThe entire affair highlights the murky nature of traumatic brain injuries, where doctors can have conflicting diagnoses, symptoms can feel pronounced one day and invisible the next, and there\u2019s no clear recovery timeline.\n\nAD\n\nSimpson said she has experienced numbness and pain in her extremities, headaches, vision troubles, nausea, fatigue, balance issues and memory problems. \u201cI remember more from being a 15-year-old than I do from the last two years of my life,\u201d she said.\n\nA history of injuries\n\nBy her count, Simpson, a lifelong soccer player, has suffered seven or eight concussions. The first occurred when she was a high school junior, when the undersized goalkeeper dived and hit her head on the ground. The migraines lasted about nine months, she recalled \u2014 \u201call day, every day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI eventually learned to live with it. And it just became white noise in my life,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nShe suffered another as a member of the University of Maryland soccer team that left her unconscious. \u201cTen seconds? 30? I really don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\nDoctors told Simpson her competitive days were over, but she stayed around the game, suffering still more playing in an adult recreation league and even one coaching.\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the risks of brain injuries in soccer, particularly among female athletes. One, led by researchers from Northwestern University and Wake Forest University, found more high school girls suffer concussions playing soccer than boys do on the football field, and another out of Michigan State highlighted the way genders are affected differently by head injuries, with women and girls often taking longer to recover.\n\nSimpson eventually turned to journalism as her ticket back into the soccer world she loved so much. She enrolled in a graduate program at Maryland and was hired by United in 2015. She wore several hats in her three years with the club, eventually overseeing marketing, communications and digital media, in addition to her on-camera role on game day.\n\nShe helped plan festivities surrounding the team\u2019s last match at RFK Stadium, organizing an alumni reunion that brought back luminaries such as Hristo Stoitchkov, Bruce Arena and Freddy Adu. In the days before her wedding in Spain, she was on the phone helping coordinate the Rooney announcement. And she spent months helping to strategize and plan for the opening of Audi Field. She has a hard hat and a commemorative shovel from the groundbreaking on display in her Alexandria home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSimpson married Nathan Getty on May 26, 2018, and the weeks that followed were consumed by preparations for the new stadium. \u201cIt was a little tough to be newlyweds with somebody working 14-hour days, seven days a week,\u201d Getty said. \u201cBut I was very proud of her.\u201d\n\nThe pivotal moment\n\nSimpson was at the stadium until around midnight the day before the first game getting things ready. Crews were putting the final touches on the stadium, going through a checklist to obtain a temporary certificate of occupancy.\n\nGetty dropped Simpson off at Audi Field the next day around noon, eight hours before the match was set to begin. Simpson had just finished taping an interview with former player Jaime Moreno, one of the franchise\u2019s most celebrated stars, and was near an outdoor set at field level about 15 minutes before the pregame show was scheduled to begin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe was juggling text messages, and her broadcast partners, Dave Johnson and Devon McTavish, were just a couple of feet away.\n\n\u201cThen, all of a sudden, I just hear this clanging,\u201d she said.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have any recollection of the strip of metal hitting her. The aluminum cap had covered a railing about 15 to 20 feet above and had apparently become detached. Simpson believes it was about 12 feet long and weighed 40 pounds.\n\nWhat exactly happened next is the subject of debate. The Washington Post reviewed video of the incident. It shows the railing falling near the right side of Simpson\u2019s head. The action unfolds quickly and, given the camera angle, it\u2019s difficult to discern the nature of any impact.\n\nAD\n\nIn the video, Simpson immediately crouches. Johnson and McTavish check on her. She never drops her phone, but after 40 seconds she stumbles backward and nearly collapses. McTavish helps brace her. And a minute after the railing fell, Simpson is holding her head as she is helped to a seat.\n\nAD\n\nNeither Johnson nor McTavish was made available by United to comment on the incident. One person who was there that day said Simpson \u201cwas really dazed and kind of out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was conscious, but you could tell she was really stunned,\u201d said the person, who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the incident and requested anonymity. \u201cWe had to fight with her to leave. She wanted to stay. \u201d\n\nGetty was nearby and, though he didn\u2019t see the railing strike his wife, he rushed to her side when it became clear what had happened. He recalls holding her hand and looking at Simpson as she said to him, \u201cWhere\u2019s my husband?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know it was him,\u201d she said recently through tears.\n\nGrim aftermath\n\nSimpson said she barely could leave the couch for weeks afterward. She couldn\u2019t keep any food down, had trouble seeing out of her right eye and was in constant pain. Getty covered the front window with a blanket to keep the living room as dark as possible.\n\nAD\n\nSimpson said she was having trouble speaking and couldn\u2019t remember how to make coffee. The couple moved two weeks later, and Simpson said she has no recollection of packing or unpacking or settling into their new home.\n\nAccording to medical notes from one of her treating physicians from around that time, Simpson had suffered a concussion, and the \u201crelated cognitive, physical, emotional and social difficulties are resulting in periodic depressed mood and anxiety that further exacerbate her physical symptoms. Another physician wrote \u201cconcussion without loss of consciousness\u201d in listing Simpson\u2019s ailments and symptoms in his medical notes.\n\nBut after viewing the video of the incident, Great Divide Insurance reached a different conclusion. In February 2019 \u2014 71/2 months after the accident \u2014 the company sent Simpson to a neurosurgeon for an independent medical examination, and he found \u201ca lack of evidence to support cerebral concussion or postconcussive syndrome.\u201d Schloss, Simpson\u2019s attorney, said the insurance company relied on a spinal specialist, not a concussion expert, and his opinion runs counter to what all of her treating physicians said.\n\nThe surgeon said Simpson probably was struck in the shoulder and her symptoms were unrelated to the accident. He relied heavily on the video in making his determination, according to his notes, reviewing it frame by frame and in slow motion.\n\n\u201cIt is completely unlikely based on this film that she actually sustained a head strike,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile she has a slight flinch corresponding with the sound of the railing coming loose, she does not flinch as it goes by her head or move in reaction to a head strike stimulus. Instead, her movement secondary to the trauma occurs when the railing hits her shoulder. I am convinced that there was absolutely no head strike.\u201d\n\nUnited declined to comment on the specifics of Simpson\u2019s case, saying in a statement: \u201cThe workers\u2019 compensation matter is directed by the insurance carrier and its designated counsel and is not within D.C. United\u2019s control. It is our understanding that the insurance company arranged for Ms. Simpson to be examined by a medical expert as part of the workers\u2019 compensation process and based on the medical expert\u2019s findings, the insurance company discontinued Ms. Simpson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d\n\nSimpson has an administrative hearing in her workers\u2019 compensation case scheduled for December.\n\nJohns Hopkins specialists recently recommended inpatient rehabilitation, which means Simpson\u2019s expenses are mounting. The accident caused nerve damage that has required two surgeries, she said, and the couple has spent more than $80,000 with the aid of a medical loan.\n\nOn a mission\n\nTwo years in, the symptoms are like a constant companion. Simpson said she will forget why she is in a grocery store and become unsure how to get out. She is scared to drive. She is having to relearn Spanish, in which she was once fluent. The smallest tasks exhaust her, reading is difficult, and electronic screens are blinding. She keeps a nausea pill in her wallet, and so does Getty whenever they leave the house. She uses sticky notes to remind her of simple tasks and forgets to close cabinets, turn off lights and shut off the stove.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stuff that you hear about your 85-year-old grandmother doing. And it\u2019s scary,\u201d she said.\n\nSimpson gets choked up talking about the sacrifices her husband has made to serve as a caretaker, and talking about how their time as newlyweds was marred by the accident and her recovery.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s hard because, you know, these are moments that you can\u2019t take back,\u201d she said.\n\nShe got a Coton de Tulear puppy to aid with her recovery, spends time in the garden and finds that some days are better than others.\n\nSince her first concussion as a high school goalkeeper, she has faced questions about the veracity of the injury. Even loved ones at times struggle to understand the severity of a wound they can\u2019t see.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just always this scrutiny of, you know, if I can\u2019t see it, if there\u2019s not an X-ray that proves it, then what\u2019s real?\u201d she said.\n\nSimpson would love to return to the pro sports world someday, but for now she is starting to see value in sharing her story. She is launching a nonprofit called the Champion Comeback Foundation and wants to provide resources for others recovering from brain injuries. Getty is also hopeful the foundation can provide a support network for caregivers, the family and friends who tend to those who have suffered brain injuries.\n\nFor weeks, she had been dreading the two-year anniversary of the accident, but she began to embrace it as a \u201csecond birthday,\u201d as she called it, and a chance to start anew.\n\n\u201cOver the last few weeks, really, I\u2019m no longer waiting for that magic moment where I wake up and everything\u2019s back to normal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about training my brain so I can do the things I used to do cognitively.\u201d\n\nSimpson recently agreed to donate her brain to researchers at Boston University, and even as her recovery slowly moves along, creating the foundation \u2014 finally planning for something \u2014 has buoyed her spirits.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/21/she-had-her-dream-job-sideline-reporter-an-accident-audi-field-changed-everything/", "author": ["Rick Maese", "Reporter Covering A Variety Of Subjects", "Including Health", "Safety", "Olympics", "Legal", "Political Issues In Sports"]}]}, "americanflavor": {"link": "https://americanflavor.news/category/public-health/", "articles": []}, "bb4sp": {"link": "https://bb4sp.com/tag/donald-trump/", "articles": []}, "beforeitsnews": {"link": "https://beforeitsnews.com", "articles": [{"title": "X22Report: Never Seen Panic Like This, it\u2019s Time, This Is Not About Another 4 Year Election! - Must Video", "text": "X22Report: Never Seen Panic Like This, it\u2019s Time, This Is Not About Another 4 Year Election! - Must Video\n\n% of readers think this story is Fact.

A biblical look at the history of fallen angels and it\u2019s relationship to the New World Order and the new age movement. Topics covered are the fall of mankind, the pre-flood world as Atlantis, the new age through theosophy, the fallen angels and their origin of planting the seeds to society, UFO\u2019s, ET\u2019s and abduction cases, demonic possession, channeling, and more. All of these things are explained and predicted in the bible\n\n*AGE OF DECEIT 2* (FULL)\n\nMany believe Alchemy is merely a false science with the hopes to transmute base metals into gold. In reality, alchemy is an occult metaphor for transforming the human being from our current fallen state into a godlike ascended state. Such desires to discover the elixir of life, known as the philosophers stone, that would give man longevity, and the return to our glorified state of being has been part of mythological lure for centuries. But with the advent of the scientific and technological advancement in our day, these occult dreams founded in the alchemical philosophy are now being fulfilled. The Bible seems to speak of a day when the false prophet, through the lies of Satan would create an Image that will have breath and speak, causing the world to worship the image, and take it\u2019s mark, or else be killed. Is it possible that these future events spoken about in Revelation 13, are in fact unfolding right before our eyes? Does Artificial Intelligence, a hope for a singularity, and the advent of transhumanism, all play a role in the grand deception that will enslave humanity through the lie that the Mark of the Beast is actually the Philosophers Stone?\n\n*AGE OF DECEIT 3* (FULL) Remnants in the Cyber_Hive Earth\n\nIn this third film in the AGE OF DECEIT series, we explore the massive and rapid changes from the economy, the infrastructure of cities, communities, families, and even our own biology, and how it\u2019s all beginning to look/sound/feel/become eerily similar to what was recorded in the ancient Scriptures. Understanding the circumstances surrounding the Tower of Babel helps us properly analyze and assess our current conflict laden society regarding everything from politics, geopolitics, science and technology, among a variety of spiritual issues like metaphysics, angels, demons, gods, and God. The human rebellion has been part of the issue concerning our current state of affairs. But too many do not consider the divine rebellion as the primary source of our situation. Agents of the divine rebellion seem to be all over the emergence of computing technology and cybernetics in the 20th century. As the 21st century marches on, we expect to see the tangible effects emerge more and more. In our contemporary milieu where philosophical propositions like the \u201csimulation theory\u201d are becoming the common perception of the world, it becomes obvious that sin itself is akin to a computer virus, attempting to derail the intended purpose, will and work of God\u2019s creation. The effects of the sin virus is decay, with the goal of death. But our reality is not left to dust. Embedded in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, are all the necessary pieces of information to declare the reversal of the sin virus (remission of sin/repentance) and hence the eradication of death. His bodily resurrection also declares the promised state of our own resurrection, when we will get to reign with God as heirs to Christ.", "link": "https://beforeitsnews.com/prophecy/2020/07/age-of-deceit-1fallen-angels-and-the-new-world-order-2alchemy-and-the-rise-of-the-beast-image-3-remnants-in-the-cyber-hive-earth-great-videos-by-face-like-the-sun-to-give-you-a-solid-foundation-2512774.html", "author": ["The Last Trumpet", "Stellar Prophet"]}, {"title": "Information About The Dreaded \"Virus\" They Don't Want You To Know", "text": "Information About The Dreaded \"Virus\" They Don't Want You To Know\n\n% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith COVID-19 still a threat and the flu, common cold, and other bugs lurking, you want to make sure your immune system is ready to mount a strong defense and keep you from getting sick. \u201cThe best strategy at this point is two-fold: both prevention of infection and strengthening the immune system,\u201d Valerie LeComte, DO, an emergency medicine specialist in Southern Colorado\n\nOlder adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing serious complications from COVID-19 illness.\n\nImmune System Information\n\nDo you seem to always get sick, while your friends seem to never get sick? Maybe it\u2019s time you need to think about strengthening your immune system. A Balanced Immune System is the key to wellness.\n\nYou may pay more attention to the health of your immune system, when colds and flu surround you. But the truth is, your immune system has to work hard all through the year, whether it\u2019s offering protection from a flu virus or an infection that could happen any time.\n\nAccording to WebMD, The immune system is your body\u2019s natural defense system. It\u2019s an intricate network of cells, tissues, and organs that band together to defend your body against invaders. Those invaders can include bacteria, viruses, parasites, even a fungus, all with the potential to make us sick. They are everywhere \u2013 in our homes, offices, and backyards. A healthy immune system protects us by first creating a barrier that stops those invaders, or antigens, from entering the body.\n\nThe Immune System does not know the name of any sickness or disease.\n\nIn today\u2019s society it seems like we are confronted with ever increasing health issues and are more vulnerable to them. Dr. Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization, speaking at a conference in Copenhagen, said antibiotic resistance could bring about \u201cthe end of modern medicine as we know it\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately we have become accustomed to treating the health effects, overlooking the health cause, which usually is a compromised Immune System. This can occur through our diet, environment, life style, injury, disease or infection.\n\nThe purpose of the Immune System is to keep microorganism such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites out of the body and destroy infectious microorganism that invade the body.\n\nThe Immune System is a complex network of cells and organs that protect the body from infection. Lymphoid organs play a role in the production and activation of lymphocytes. Lymphocytes both B & T cells are two major groups which recognize and attack infectious microorganisms.\n\nNatural Immunity is created by the body\u2019s natural barriers skin, mouth, urinary track and eye surface. Another is in the form of antibodies passed from mother to child.\n\nAcquired Immunity develops when antigens enter the body. The Immune System recognizes these intruders and produces antibodies to fight future intruders. This minor overview of an amazing interconnected Immune System demonstrates the vital necessity in maintaining a healthy immune system.\n\nSurfactant Information\n\nIn the surfactant family there are over 5,000 products. These products are usually organic compounds that reduce the surface tension. This is called Interfacial Tension as between two liquids or a liquid and a solid. Hydrogen Bonding occurs both in Inorganic molecules such as water which is polar with positive and negative ends and Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic organic molecules such as proteins.\n\nSurface tension is a measurement of the attraction molecules have for each other. The attraction force pulls fluids into a shape with the smallest surface area. This is why drops of water on a flat surface are round and beaded rather than flat. If the surface tension is lowered, the attraction among molecules of the fluid is decreased and the surface area of the fluid flattens out and increases.\n\nImmusist is a Ground Breaking Surficant that helps you on a cellular level.\n\nExample: If a drop of IMMUSIST\u2122 is added to a drop of water, this fluid flattens out making water wetter and accelerating absorption. This is the same type of principle that can take place at a cellular level in the body.\n\nWhat is IMMUSIST\u2122\n\nIMMUSIST\u2122 is a Proprietary blend of Surfactants. It was formulated by blending certain surfactants with characteristics such as Antivirals, Antifungals, Antioxidants and Antibacterials that can reduce surface tension, reduce inflammation while hydrating and oxygenating the cells. This unique formula which is not a drug, medicine or dietary supplement has its own molecular foot print that is called IMMUSIST\u2122.\n\nWhy IMMUSIST\u2122\n\nThough Research, Development and Life Experiences IMMUSIST\u2122 has shown the benefits of Surfactant Wellness\u2122 in the Immune Systems. That\u2019s why all age groups children, adults and seniors use IMMUSIST\u2122 Beverage Concentrate, the Clear Choice for Immune Systems.\n\nWhy IMMUSIST\u2122\n\nThough Research, Development and Life Experiences IMMUSIST\u2122 has shown the benefits of Surfactant Wellness\u2122 in the Immune Systems.

We are two events away from the Great Tribulation namely the assassination of the two false prophets in Rev. 11:7-11 and the Harpazo.\n\nHave the Nazis infiltrated the American Government?\n\nAt the end of World War 2, America brought thousands of former Nazis into the country. This Nazi invasion was done with the help of the Vatican, which constructed ratlines, a series of safe Catholic institutions to move these Nazis into countries like Spain and Argentina and then on to America. This Nazi infiltration was orchestrated with the help of the Khazars, who say they are Jews and are not, the Freemasons and the Jesuits. These three groups have one thing in common with their god the devil. They want to destroy the ethics and morals of Protestant America and Britain and the Commonwealth. They want to destroy capitalism and the freedoms the constitution offers Americans, and introduce a global system of authoritarian communist dictatorship. The devil\u2019s commandments are completely opposite of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s commandments. There will no longer be good and evil. Just evil! Instead of Love your Neighbour, the devil is encourageing everyone to \u201csnitch\u201d on their neighbour. God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob tells us to \u201cGo forth and Multiply\u201d. The Devil will prohibit the white couples by procreating by separating all heterosexual couples and killing all babies as soon as they are born.\n\nPeople have been given strong delusion (2 Thess. 2:11), and will accept a False Savior when a powerful, charismatic leader spouting peace and unity comes on the scene. But this antiMessiah will turn out to be much more than they bargained for. He will be a dictator whose cruelty will be more than any other the world has ever imagined. This man referred to as The Little Horn in Daniel 7:7-8 will be the final Nimrod type antiChrist to come onto the world scene as he will rule the world and demand recognition as a god to be worshipped.\n\nDeciphering Revelation with the Pesher and Holy Gematria\n\nLed by the Holy Ghost, I then discovered that there were two cyphers embedded in the works of the New Testament and the Dead Sea Scrolls. The first is a word based cypher referred to as a Pesher or Riddle, but with only one possible solution. It was used to hide valuable historical information such as the true identity of individuals, times and dates of events, distances and locations. The second type of cypher was a number based cypher based on the twenty-two characters of the Hebrew alphabet. The characters in both the Hebrew and Greek alphabet equate to numbers. Revelation was written in Hebrew and Greek, and John gives us the mathematical formula to solve the entire veiled prophecy when he tells us to calculate the name of the beast, whose number is six hundred three score and six (660+6). Note it is not 666 but rather it is 660+6 that the number of the Beast must match. We can only unveil the prophecy in Revelation by the same means it was originally veiled, namely Holy Gematria.\n\nEvery fact is to be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses (2 Corinthians 13:1; Deuteronomy 17:6 and 19:15). The word witnesses in Gematria also equates to the word Gematria, and I have used three types of Holy Gematria to confirm my findings, namely Jewish, English and Simple Gematria. These three Gematria numbers reduced to a single digit are my three witnesses. How do we know using Holy Gematria is a valid concept to verify truth in the Bible? Our Father, who art in heaven, used His Holy Gematria to veil His prophecy in Revelation, and King David used Holy Gematria with an Ephod or an Abacus to submit questions to God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob (1 Samuel 30:7-8). As long as you have received wisdom and understanding directly from the Holy Ghost, you can use Holy Gematria to help you decipher the Holy Scriptures as our Father God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob cannot lie (Titus 1:2; Numbers 23:9).\n\nHoly Gematria and a Pesher Code was used to seal the prophecy in Revelation which I have used to unseal the prophecy along with my helper, the Holy Ghost. The Gematria calculator at gematrix.org was used for all calculations and the NASB77 version of the Bible unless otherwise noted. I am primarily using Mispar Katan Mispari Gematria (integral reduced value) where the total numerical value of a word is reduced to a single digit. If the sum of the value exceeds 9, the integer values of the total are repeatedly added to produce a single-digit number. I have some additional rules for Holy Gematria such as adding and subtracting the Gematria numbers, taking factors of the numbers and adding or subtracting an aleph to the number and an additional aleph for every aleph in the number as confirmed by the Holy Ghost.\n\nI am comparing a word or phrase in the Holy Scriptures to the underlying meaning of the word or phrase lead by my helper, the Holy Ghost, and Holy Gematria. Providing I obtain three witnesses or the matching of three Holy Gematria numbers using the Gematria calculator, I can be confident that a match has been found and the underlying meaning of the Holy Scripture verse has been revealed. If there is a four digit number in Gematria between 1000 to 2022, then we must examine the events in that year to see what additional information God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob may be giving us. History shows us that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\n\nThe Calculation of \u201cThe antiChrist\u201d Referred to as The Little Horn Dan 7:7-8\n\nHere is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is six hundred three score and six. (Revelation 13:18)\n\nThe number 666 consists of three digits or three pieces of information, namely the name, city and country of birth. We then must locate a conqueror whose name, city and country add to 600 three score (60) and 6.\n\nSix six six\n\n= 1197 or 97+11 = 108 or 10+8 = 18 or 6\n\n= 936 or 93+6 = 99 or 9+9 = 18 or 6\n\n= 156 or 1+5+6 = 12 or 6\n\nthree pieces of information\n\n= 841 or 84 or 8+4 = 12 or 6\n\n= 1608 or 16+8 = 24 or 6\n\n= 268 or 26-8 = 18 or 6\n\nname city and place of birth\n\n= 1761 or 61+17 = 78 or 7+8 = 15 or 1+5 = 6\n\n= 1818 or 18+18 = 36 or 6\n\n= 303 or 3+0+3 = 6\n\nWe must first see how the number 666 relates to man. An atom is a basic unit of matter that consists of a dense central nucleus surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. Carbon-12 is one of five elements that make up human DNA, being composed of six protons, six electrons, and six neutrons, or 666. This is how 666 relates to man. Carbon-12 is the more abundant of the two staple isotopes of the element carbon, accounting for 98.89% of carbon. Its abundance is due to the triple-alpha process, by which it is created by the stars. Our bodies are actually atoms, which are connected to the entire solar system! Songwriter Joni Mitchell was correct in the song she wrote entitled \u201cWoodstock\u201d. We are all Star Dust!\n\nThere are many antiChrists in the End Times. The main antiChrist is the Little Horn in Daniel 7:7-8.\n\nOn 13 October 2016, the UN General Assembly adopted by acclamation a resolution to formally appoint Ant\u00f3nio Guterres of Portugal as Secretary-General for a five-year term of office, starting on 1 January 2017.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Manuel de Oliveira Guterres, the current Secretary General of the United Nations, was born on 30 April 1949 in Lisbon Portugal. Note that Portugal is part of one of the Tribes of Israel.\n\nWe need to use the English Gematria on gematrix.org in order to calculate the number beast.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Manuel de Oliveira Guterres = 2202 or 2+2+0+2 = 6 )*\n\nLisbon = 426 or 42+6 = 48 )*\n\nSubtotal = 2202+426 = 2628 or 2+6+2+8 = 18 or 6\n\nAlternatively \u03a3 * = The Sum of 6+48 = 54 or 6 (6\u00d79 = 54)\n\nPortugal = 660\n\nCountry of Birth = 660 + (Full Name + City of Birth) = 6\n\nTotal 660+6\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres will be the ruler of the New World Order. Antonio Guterres who is the last world leader is actually Nimrod who was the first world leader. He is again trying to usurp God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob, Creator of the Universe, through the use of CERN, the Large Hadron Collider which is located along the Franco-Swiss border. CERN\u2019s headquarters is in the town of Meyrin, which is not far from Geneva Switzerland. CERN is actually a weapon which is trying to create a hole in the veil that God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob stretched over the entire earth (Isaiah 25:7). Earth is actually a prison colony. After the removal from earth of the Saints or Firstfruits in the Rapture, Cern will be successful in tearing the veil, allowing dark matter and every evil imaginable to descend to earth. Men\u2019s hearts will fail them from fear (Luke 21:25-26). However as I stated previously, the main objective of Nimrod is to attempt to kill Jesus when he touches down and returns to earth by having Jesus sucked into the black hole they are trying to create by tearing the veil. See Psalm 2:4-5 and Psalm 37:12-15 for God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s reaction to Nimrod\u2019s and humankind\u2019s efforts. God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob laughs at the wicked in derision.\n\nNow let us look at the Gematria of Ant\u00f3nio Guterres who is currently the Secretary General of the United Nations who will lead the New World Order.\n\nI am matching all three Gematria numbers (Jewish, English and Simple) from the Bible verse to the underlying meaning of the verse. I reduce the Gematria number to a single digit and am comparing the three final numbers from the bible verse to the underlying to obtain a match of all three numbers or three witnesses.\n\nBeast (Revelation 13:18)\n\n= 198 or 98+1 = 99 or 9+9 = 18 or 8-1 = 7\n\n= 282 or 28+2 = 30 or 6\n\n= 47 or 4+7 = 11 or 8\n\nanother horn, a little one (Daniel 7:8)\n\n= 812 or 81-2 = 79 or 7+9 = 16 or 1+6 = 7\n\n= 1494 or 94-14 = 80 or 8\n\n= 249 or 49+2 = 51 or 5+1 = 6\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres\n\n= 807 or 80+7 or 87 or 8+7 = 15 or 1+5 = 6\n\n= 1206 or 12+6 = 18 or 8\n\n= 201 or 20+1 = 21 or 7\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the current Secretary General of the United Nations is the main antiChrist of the end times who will lead the One World Government, One World Currency and One World Religion or the Little Horn as referred to in Daniel 7:7-8.\n\nDaniel 7:7-8 The Little Horn\n\n\u201cAfter this I kept looking in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, dreadful and terrifying and extremely strong; and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and trampled down the remainder with its feet; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. \u201cWhile I was contemplating the horns, behold, another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were pulled out by the roots before it; and behold, this horn possessed eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth uttering great boasts. (Daniel 7:7-8 NASB77)\n\nI considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things. (Daniel 7:8 KJV)\n\nAnd out of one of them came forth a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Beautiful Land. (Daniel 8:9)\n\nanother horn, a little one\n\n= 812 or 12+8 = 20 or 4\n\n= 1494 or 94-14 = 80 or 8\n\n= 249 or 49+2 = 51 or 5+1 = 6\n\nanother little horn\n\n= 716 or 7+1+6 = 14 or 4\n\n= 1284 or 84+12 = 96 or 9+6 = 15 or 1+5 = 6\n\n= 214 or 14+2 = 16 or 8\n\na rather small horn\n\n= 614 or 14+6 = 20 or 4\n\n= 1098 or 98+1 = 99 or 9+9 = 18 or 8\n\n= 183 or 1+8+3 = 12 or 6\n\nThe Little Horn\n\n= 545 or 45-5 = 40 or 8\n\n= 996 or 9+9+6 = 24 or 6\n\n= 166 or 1+6+6 = 13 or 1+3 = 4\n\nAnother Little Horn or The Litte Horn refers to the Nimrod type antiChrist on the evidence of three matching numbers or witnesses (8-6-4).\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Manuel de Oliveira Guterres\n\n= 1986 or 1+9+8+6 = 24 or 4\n\n= 2202 or 22+2 = 24 or 6\n\n= 367 or 3+6+7 = 16 or 8\n\nantiChrist\n\n= 440 or 4+4+0 = 8\n\n= 726 or 7+2+6 = 15 or 1+5 = 6\n\n= 121 or 21+1 = 22 or 2+2 = 4\n\nI believe Ant\u00f3nio Manuel de Oliveira Guterres is the Little Horn or the \u201cNimrod the antiChrist\u201d that will be ruling the One World Government, One World Currency and One World Religion along with False Prophet Francis and Killer Gates.\n\nRevelation 13:11 The Beast Coming Up Out of The Earth (WW3)\n\nLet us now see who the False Prophet is today.\n\nAnd I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon. (Revelation 13:11)\n\nAnd I saw another beast coming up out of the earth;\n\n= 2639 or 39+26 = 65 or 65+1= 66 or 6+6 = 12 or 6\n\n= 2754 or 2+7+5+4 = 18 or 666 or 6\n\n= 459 or 45+9 = 54 or 6\n\nFalse Prophet\n\n= 485 or 48-5 = 43 or 43-1 = 42 or 4+2 = 6\n\n= 846 or 8+4+6=18 or 666 or 6\n\n= 141 or 1+4+1= 6\n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio (Pope Francis)\n\n= 1142 or 42-11 = 31 or 31-1= 30 or 6\n\n= 1206 or 12+6= 18 or 6\n\n= 201 or 20-1 = 19 or 19-1 = 18 or 666\n\nPope Francis\n\n= 404 or 40-4 = 36 or 6\n\n= 732 or 7+3+2 = 12 or 6\n\n= 122 or 22+1 = 23 or 23+1 = 24 or 6\n\nand he spoke as a dragon\n\n= 547 or 54+7 = 61 or 61-1 = 60 or 6\n\n= 1068 or 68+10 = 78 or 7+8 = 15 or 1+5 = 6\n\n= 178 or 1+7+8 = 16 or 6\n\nand he spoke as a pope\n\n= 540 or 54 or 6\n\n= 1026 or 26+10 = 36 or 6\n\n= 171 or 71+1 = 72 or 6\n\nCalculation of the Number of the Beast using English Gematria:\n\nJorge = 330\n\nMario = 336\n\nSubtotal = 666 or 660 + 6\n\nBergoglio = 540\n\nFlores = 450\n\nBuenos Aires = 768\n\nArgentina = 534\n\nSubtotal = 2292 or 2+2+9+2 = 15 or 1+5 = 6\n\nTotal = 660 + (6+6 or 12 or 6) = 660 + 6\n\nThe False Prophet today is Pope Francis. Note the calculation of the Beast is 660+6.\n\nIn Revelation chapter 13, the Apostle John wrote of the coming last days events and the plans of the antiChrist to rule the world with his pawn and puppet, the False Prophet forcing the entire world into beast/satan worship. There will be worldwide Satanism. In order to participate in the new global economy, every person will be forced through various government\u2019s legislations to accept a chip or mark of some kind in or on their right hand or forehead. By accepting this chip or mark, one is also announcing their loyalty to the antiChrist and the acceptance of his world rule over this new economic system. The entire world will be forced to worship him as god.\n\nKiller Gates will be in charge of the Mark of the Beast which is tied to Digitial ID 2020 and will include the Covid-19 vaccines, Covid-19 contaminated tests, biometrics, body interfacing digital currency, RFID digital tattoo and digital vaccine passport tattoo. I believe the Covid-19 vaccines will be laced with the Bubonic plague and / or Ebola and will turn people either into a zombie or kill you.\n\nThe neuralink could also be another type of Mark of the Beast as God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob does not dwell in a machine and the neuralink will separate you from God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and make you lose your free will and become a zombie.\n\nDo not get the chip or tattoo. Do not get the mark of the beast!\n\nEscape the coming enslavement by accepting Jesus Our Messiah, Yeshua Ha Mashiach, as your Savior now before it\u2019s too late. For once you accept this chip or mark, you will forfeit your soul to Satan. You will spend an eternity or at least 1,000 years in hell with Satan once you die. Satan wants your soul and it is up to you to proect your soul by not taking the Mark of the Beast.\n\nThree for the Price Of One World Leaders\n\nThe three major characters Leading us to Armageddong are Antonio Guterres, Pope Francis, Killer Gates and all three have the same Gematria numbers of 1206 and 201. It is interesting to also note that Guterres is a Portugese Jew, Francis is an Argentinian Jew and Killer Gates is a Bavarian German Jew.\n\nAntonio Guterres (Secretary General of the United Nations)\n\n= 857 or 85+7 = 92 or 9+2 = 11 or 8\n\n= 1206 or 12+6 = 18 or 9\n\n= 201 or 20+1 = 21 or 7\n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio. (Pope Francis)\n\n= 1142 or 1+1+4+2 = 8\n\n= 1206 or 12+6 = 18 or 9\n\n= 201 or 20+1 = 21 or 7\n\nWilliam Henry Gates\n\n= 1725 or 25-17 = 8\n\n= 1206 or 12+6 = 18 or 9\n\n= 201 or 20+1 = 21 or 7\n\nIt is interesting to note that Antonio Guterres, Pope Francis and Bill Gates all have 1206 and 201 in their Gematria numbers. These are all fallen angels which I believe are all controlled by \u201cthe Devil and Satan\u201d Rev. 12:9.\n\nThere are many antiChrists in the End Times as prophesied in 1 John 2:18. The main antiChrist is represented by the little Horn in Daniel 7:7-8.\n\nZechariah 13:8-9 tells us that 2/3 of the white Israelite people and Christians will perish in the Great Tribulation and 1/3 will be brought the flood and fire by Jesus Our Messiah.\n\nThe Church of Philadelphia will be saved from the hour of testing and removed and hidden before th nuclear war. The Israelites and Christians will be brough through the flood and nuclear fire unscathed by Jesus Our Messiah.\n\n8\u201cAnd it will come about in all the land,\u201d\n\nDeclares the LORD,\n\n\u201cThat two parts in it will be cut off and perish;\n\nBut the third will be left in it.\n\n9\u201cAnd I will bring the third part through the fire,\n\nRefine them as silver is refined,\n\nAnd test them as gold is tested.\n\nThey will call on My name,\n\nAnd I will answer them;\n\nI will say, \u2018They are My people,\u2019\n\nAnd they will say, \u2018The LORD is my God.\u2019\u201d (Zechariah 13:8-9)\n\n\u201cWhen you pass through the waters, I will be with you; And through the rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched, Nor will the flame burn you. (Isaiah 43:2)\n\nGod of Abraham Isaac and Jacob promised to save a remnant of the white race and gather them from the four corners of the earth after they have spent time in a slave labour camp in foreign lands, most likely China in their ghost cities. The remnant will be sent by ships to Egypt as per Deut. 28:68 for the Greater Second Exodus in Egypt. Jesus the Messiah will lead His people into the promised land as Jacob promised Joseph in Genesis 48:21.\n\nAmerica is the Tribe of Manasseh and Britain and the Commonwealth are The Tribe of Ephraim, the two tribes that received most of the blessings.\n\nAmerica and Britian are also Babylon the Great and will receive God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s wrath from turning their face away from Him and disobeying His Laws and Ordinances. America will be receiving a double portion of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s wrath for her wicked deeds and Canada (Ephraim) and Mexico will be a casualty of war. (Revelation 18:2-6).\n\nAmerica is the Tribe of Manasseh, the Thirteenth Tribe\n\nEven the first two civil war battles fought in America were named after Manassas and places in America are named after Manassas. Manasseh means forgetfulness and America has certainly forgotten their heritage.\n\nThe First Battle of Bull Run was also known as the First Battle of Manassas.\n\nSecond Battle of Bull Run, also called Second Battle of Manassas or Second Manassas, (August 29\u201330, 1862), fought at a small stream named Bull Run, near Manassas in Northern Viriginia.\n\nRev 11:7-12 The Assassination of Trump and Pence\n\nTrump and Pence (the two prophets of Rev 11:10) will be assassinated, (when they have finished their testimony as per Rev 11:7) or have been removed through the establishment of martial law. (The beast that comes up out of the abyss will kill them as per Rev 11:7) or Barack Obama with assistance from the C.I.A. And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt Rev 11:8. Trump and Pence will be killed in the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.\n\nAmerica is going to be destroyed and that is why the rider on the white horse is going to be killed and going down with the ship. Trump has already done his job as King Cyrus to take down Babylon (America) without firing a shot.\n\nAmerica is the tribe of Manasseh and judgement starts in the house of Israel (the people of Jacob-Israel and not the Khazar Zionist state of Israel created by Rothschild in 1948). The tribes of Israel are not lost and they include America, Britain and the British Commonwealth Nations and the Western European Nations. America (Manasseh) and Britain (Ephraim) are Babylon the Great (Rev. 18:2) and America will be receiving a double portion of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s wrath for her evil deeds according to Revelation 18:6.\n\nWe are two events away from the Great Tribulation commonly referred to as The Time of Jacob\u2019s Trouble namely the assassination of the two false prophets in Rev. 11:7-11 and the Harpazo which will occur 3 \u00bd days after the assassination of the two imposter prophets. See link below.\n\nThe Second Woe of Revelation \u2013 Waiting for the Final Shoe to Drop \u2013 Who Are the Four Witnesses and the Two Impostor Prophets in Revelation 11?

Messiah ben Joseph (who will be killed) and the Messiah ben David. Donald Trump, who is Jewish is King of Edom (Modern Jewry) and will be declared Messiah Ben Joseph after he is assassinated and raised from the dead 3\u00bd days later. Donald Trump\u2019s youngest son Barron will be declared Messiah Ben David. This prophecy is all according to the Chabad Lubavitch movement and the Edomites (Modern Jewry). These Edomite Jews believe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, their Rebbe, will transmigrate and return. Barron Trump has the same Gematria numbers as Menachem Mendel Schneerson and the Jews will say Barron Trump is the transmigrated Menachem Mendel Schneerson because of matching Gematria numbers. Everything is about the number with the Jews and they even murder by the numbers. These Edomites (modern Jewry) will have a one way ticket to the Lake of Fire.\n\nUsing the Gematria calculator at gematrix.org so you can follow along. I compare the bible verse to the underlying meaning of the bible verse with my helper the Holy Spirit and reduce the Gematria number to a single digit. I compare the final ending single digits from the bible verse to the underlying meaning and if I get 3 matching witnesses, then I am confident that I have found a match to the meaning of the bible veerse.\n\nMessiah Ben David\n\n= 998 or 99-8 = 91 or 9+1 = 10 or 10-1 = 9\n\n= 810 or 10+8 = 18 or 6\n\n= 135 or 35+1 = 36 or 6\n\nMenachem Mendel Schneerson\n\n= 637 or 63+7 = 70 or 10 or 10-1 = 9\n\n= 1410 or 10+14 = 24 or 6 (see below)\n\n= 235 or 53-2 = 51 or 5+1= 6 (see below)\n\nBarron William Trump\n\n= 1712 or 1+7+1+2 = 11 or 9\n\n= 1410 or 10+14 = 24 or 6 (see above)\n\n= 235 or 23-5 = 18 or 6 (see above)\n\nBarron Trump, youngest son of Donald Trump, will be proclaimed the Messiah Ben David who I believe is the transmigrated Menachem Mendel Schneerson according to the three matching witnesses in Holy Gematria. According to Holy Gematria, Barron Trump is the transmigrated Menachem Schneerson and will be declared the Messiah Ben David by Chabad Lubavitch, as they both have 1410 and 235 in their Gematria numbers and, as well, they both match 6-6-9.

Dope Francis is an Argentinian Jew, A Fallen Watcher, and has called on the extermination of the white race. Dope Francis worships Lucifer and plans to lead as many souls to Hell before Jesus the Messiah returns to exterminate all evil on the earth and lock up the Devil again. Please see my previous articles on Dope Francis and Recep Erdogan (the Beast of the Sea). Erdogan is the Assyrian and the transmigrated Ninurta. Erdogan is also the rider on the pale green horse and all the four horsemen have started to ride.

Notice in Revelation 6:2 the rider on the white horse is described as having a bow, but not a quiver containing arrows. In other words, Trump is nothing but a windbag who will only try to negotiate himself out of a uncomfortable situation. The white horse symbolizes salvation. Notice Jesus on his return rides a white horse (Revelation 19:11). Trump is not our Savior and certainly is not offering salvation in any shape or form. Many Americans voted for Trump as they saw him as the Savior of America, and others voted for Trump as the lessor of two evils, the other being evil Hillary. In either case, the dice were loaded against you as the Illuminati in America select your Presidential candidates, dictate who wins the elections, and believe they have control of all events here on earth. Trump stated: \u201cI am the chosen one\u201d, words that were used by Trump to describe himself. Trump is an actor and has been given a role to play in this production we are all witnesses to in order to bring this age, or the age of Pisces, to a close.\n\nThere is only one Savior of us all and that is Yeshua (Jesus) the Messiah and not Trump (Marduk) or anyone else. God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is both producer and director of this play we are all in the middle of and God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob warned us of all of these events unfolding before our eyes through His prophets. Trump is a false antiChrist and false prophet and a poor warm up act for the arrival of the true antiChrist, the leader of the one world government and one world monetary systems. The antiChrist is a type and there are many antiChrists here on earth today! (1 John 2:18). This is the last hour and Jesus is at the door! Jeremiah 50:2 confirms that Bel and Marduk will be shattered in Babylon (America). Trump is Marduk and Bel is Vice President Pence.\n\n\u201cDeclare and proclaim among the nations. Proclaim it and lift up a standard. Do not conceal it but say, \u2018Babylon has been captured, Bel has been put to shame, Marduk has been shattered; Her images have been put to shame, her idols have been shattered.\u2019 (Jeremiah 50:2)\n\nBabylon has been captured\n\n= 1119 or 1+1+1+9 = 12 or 6\n\n= 1278 or 78+12 = 90 or 9\n\n= 213 or 21+3 = 24 or 6\n\nAmerica has been captured\n\n= 733 or 33+7 = 40 or 10-1= 9\n\n= 1152 or 52+2 = 54 or 6\n\n= 192 or 1+9+2 = 12 or 6\n\nMarduk\n\n= 325 or 3+2+5 = 10 or 10-1 = 9\n\n= 408 or 40+8 = 48 or 8\n\n= 68 or 6+8 = 14 or 7\n\nDonald John Trump\n\n= 1287 or 87+12 = 99 or 9+9 = 18 or 1+8 = 9\n\n= 1110 or 10-(1+1) = 10-2 = 8\n\n= 185 or 1+8+5 = 14 or 7\n\nBel\n\n= 27 or 7-2 = 5\n\n= 114 or 1+1+4 = 6\n\n= 19 or 9-1 = 8\n\nMichael Richard Pence\n\n= 374 or 37+4 = 41 or 4+1= 5\n\n= 930 or 9+3+0 = 12 or 6\n\n= 155 or 1+5+5 = 11 or 8\n\nThe Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Leading the Tribes of Israel (Christian Nations) on a Parade to Armageddon \u2013 Now Unveiled!

This will be coupled with Gate\u2019s new invention, ID2020, which is a digital ID microchip implanted under the skin.\u201d\n\nThis RFID chip will allow the government and / or corporations to send frequencies directly into your body and manipulate you and even kill you if you do not comply.\n\nRevelation 13:17-18 The Mark Of the Beast\n\nThe Mark Of the Beast will be rolled out after the Holy Spirit is removed in the Harpazo. The Mark of the Beast is the Digital ID 2020 / COVID-19 tests / COVID-19 vaccines, tattoo, body interfacing crypto currency. Do not take the Mark of the Beast or there will be no chance for redemption. The COVID-19 contaminated tests and COVID-19 vaccines will change and corrupt your DNA and cause you to lose your free will and become either a zombie or transhuman or kill you depending on your DNA. Bill Gates is planning to put the bubonic plage in the vaccines which most certainly will kill off a majority of the population.\n\nKill Bill Gates Is A Fallen Angel\n\nI am told by the Holy Spirit that the Covid-19 vaccines will contain the bubonic plague. The Covid-19 tests are also contaminated and will make you very sick or cause death. Do not take the Covid-19 tests or Covid-19 vaccines or anything else that Kill Bill is offering you as part of ID2020 including the tattoo and the quantum dot tattoo showing your digital passport vaccine history. Kill Bill is an Evil Deomonic Fallen Angel and one of the 300 Watchers that fell to mate with women. Kill Bill is also Jewish (the Serpent Seed fathered by the Devil) and wants to kill off all humanity.\n\nSee all of Dr. Luke Prophet\u2019s articles on the Book of Revelation for the complete Rubber Necker\u2019s guide to Armageddon.

Each was described with a particular geometry, a platonic shape. For earth, that shape was the cube.\n\nThe statue of Plato by the Greek sculptor Leonidas Drosis (1836-1882) in the gardens of the Academy of Athens\n\nCredit: George E. Koronaios\n\nScience has steadily moved beyond Plato\u2019s conjectures, looking instead to the atom as the building block of the universe. Yet Plato seems to have been onto something, researchers have found.\n\nIn a new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a team from the University of Pennsylvania, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, and University of Debrecen uses math, geology, and physics to demonstrate that the average shape of rocks on Earth is a cube.\n\n\u201cPlato is widely recognized as the first person to develop the concept of an atom, the idea that matter is composed of some indivisible component at the smallest scale,\u201d says Douglas Jerolmack, a geophysicist in Penn\u2019s School of Arts & Sciences\u2019 Department of Earth and Environmental Science and in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences\u2018 Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics. \u201cBut that understanding was only conceptual; nothing about our modern understanding of atoms derives from what Plato told us.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing here is that what we find with rock, or earth, is that there is more than a conceptual lineage back to Plato. It turns out that Plato\u2019s conception about the element earth being made up of cubes is, literally, the statistical average model for real earth. And that is just mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s finding began with geometric models developed by mathematician G\u00e1bor Domokos of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, whose work predicted that natural rocks would fragment into cubic shapes.\n\n\u201cThis paper is the result of three years of serious thinking and work, but it comes back to one core idea,\u201d says Domokos. \u201cIf you take a three-dimensional polyhedral shape, slice it randomly into two fragments and then slice these fragments again and again, you get a vast number of different polyhedral shapes. But in an average sense, the resulting shape of the fragments is a cube.\u201d\n\nThe research team measured and analyzed fragmentation patterns of rocks they collected as well as from previously assembled datasets\n\n. Image: Courtesy of the authors\n\nDomokos pulled two Hungarian theoretical physicists into the loop: Ferenc Kun, an expert on fragmentation, and J\u00e1nos T\u00f6r\u00f6k, an expert on statistical and computational models. After discussing the potential of the discovery, Jerolmack says, the Hungarian researchers took their finding to Jerolmack to work together on the geophysical questions; in other words, \u201cHow does nature let this happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we took this to Doug, he said, \u2018This is either a mistake, or this is big,\u2019\u201d Domokos recalls. \u201cWe worked backward to understand the physics that results in these shapes.\u201d\n\nFundamentally, the question they answered is what shapes are created when rocks break into pieces. Remarkably, they found that the core mathematical conjecture unites geological processes not only on Earth but around the solar system as well.\n\n\u201cFragmentation is this ubiquitous process that is grinding down planetary materials,\u201d Jerolmack says. \u201cThe solar system is littered with ice and rocks that are ceaselessly smashing apart. This work gives us a signature of that process that we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nPart of this understanding is that the components that break out of a formerly solid object must fit together without any gaps, like a dropped dish on the verge of breaking. As it turns out, the only one of the so-called platonic forms\u2014polyhedra with sides of equal length\u2014that fit together without gaps are cubes.\n\n\u201cOne thing we\u2019ve speculated in our group is that, quite possibly Plato looked at a rock outcrop and after processing or analyzing the image subconsciously in his mind, he conjectured that the average shape is something like a cube,\u201d Jerolmack says.\n\n\u201cPlato was very sensitive to geometry,\u201d Domokos adds. According to lore, the phrase \u201cLet no one ignorant of geometry enter\u201d was engraved at the door to Plato\u2019s Academy. \u201cHis intuitions, backed by his broad thinking about science, may have led him to this idea about cubes,\u201d says Domokos.\n\nTo test whether their mathematical models held true in nature, the team measured a wide variety of rocks, hundreds that they collected and thousands more from previously collected datasets. No matter whether the rocks had naturally weathered from a large outcropping or been dynamited out by humans, the team found a good fit to the cubic average.\n\nHowever, special rock formations exist that appear to break the cubic \u201crule.\u201d The Giant\u2019s Causeway in Northern Ireland, with its soaring vertical columns, is one example, formed by the unusual process of cooling basalt. These formations, though rare, are still encompassed by the team\u2019s mathematical conception of fragmentation; they are just explained by out-of-the-ordinary processes at work.\n\n\u201cThe world is a messy place,\u201d says Jerolmack. \u201cNine times out of 10, if a rock gets pulled apart or squeezed or sheared\u2014and usually these forces are happening together\u2014you end up with fragments which are, on average, cubic shapes. It\u2019s only if you have a very special stress condition that you get something else. The earth just doesn\u2019t do this often.\u201d", "link": "https://beforeitsnews.com/science-and-technology/2020/07/was-plato-right-is-the-earth-made-of-cubes-2979605.html", "author": ["Alton Parrish"]}, {"title": "Benjamin Fulford: Antarctica Bombshell! World Intelligence Agencies Think We Live in a Matrix Controlled by an Artificial Intelligence", "text": "\n\n\n\nSometimes fact-based reporting leads into very strange territory. In my case, a forensic investigation into who controlled the financial system turned into a very deep rabbit hole indeed. It led me to meet with very senior intelligence agency and secret society sources who explained the concept of humanity being stuck in a matrix, created by an advanced artificial intelligence of unknown origin. Furthermore, they say this AI may well be evil or possibly insane. Now, with the global situation seeming increasingly bizarre and irrational, and with the financial system imploding, it is time to look at the evidence for this proposition. That is because, if it is true, then the only way to liberate humanity will be to defeat this rogue AI.\n\nThe first time I was told about the AI theory was when I met a grandmaster of the gnostic Illuminati. He went by the name of Alexander Romanov and was recruited by the former World chess champion Bobby Fischer. Romanov was sent to see me in order to initiate contact between the Illuminati and Asian secret societies. He told me the Illuminati was formed by the Greek mathematician Pythagoras in response to the destruction of Atlantis. They say Atlantis was a civilization in the central Mediterranean Ocean (probably the Minoan civilization) that was destroyed by a volcanic eruption and tsunami around 1600 BC. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption\n\nThe ancient Greek Illuminati believed that whatever entity caused so much destruction was evil and needed to be overthrown. In other words, they believed the suffering and misery of this world would only be ended when its creator was overthrown.\n\nThis is crazy sounding stuff. But Romanov did warn us in advance of the plans to trigger a nuclear and tsunami terror attack against Japan on March 11th, 2011. This attack was forensically traced by the NSA, Japanese military intelligence, and others to the Khazarian mafia, specifically people like former Jesuit Secretary-General Peter Hanz Kolvenbach and Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu. The Khazarian mafia, in turn, claims to take orders from some sort of entity they consider to be GOD.\n\nThe next person to talk about a rogue artificial intelligence being in charge of the planet was a man by the name of Paul Laine, who was from the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cmen who stare at goats\u201d psychic warfare division. Laine, together with a very senior silicon valley oligarch (whose identity I will keep secret in order to protect him) say the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Intelligence agency had also come to the conclusion we were dealing with some sort of AI. They noted that something was preventing humanity from leaving the Earth and that all space exploration had been stopped since the 1970s. Laine said NASA stood for \u201cNot A Space Agency.\u201d\n\nYet another source to confirm this conclusion was one of the last surviving members of the Majestic 12 group set up by former President Harry Truman to study UFOs and other unexplained phenomena. This source also said MJ12 had concluded that all UFO-related incidents ultimately traced themselves to an AI.\n\nThe reason for bringing this up now is that NASA officials also contacted us to say that recently some sort of anomaly has been changing, in their words \u201cthe very fabric of reality.\u201d This has something to do with the continuing but ultra-top secret activities going on in Antarctica.\n\nJapanese military intelligence sources say this is all somehow connected to the so-called ongoing \u201ccoronavirus\u201d epidemic.

VLA radio data from Yelena Stein and Ralf-Juergen Dettmar (Ruhr University Bochum). The observations are part of the project Continuum HAlos in Nearby Galaxies \u2014 an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES) led by Judith Irwin (Queen\u2019s University, Canada). The optical data are from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The ionized hydrogen data (red) are from the 0.9m telescope of the Kitt Peak National Observatory, collected by Richard J. Rand of the University of New Mexico. The software code for tracing the magnetic field lines was adapted by Y. Stein from Linear Integral Convolution code provided by Arpad Miskolczi of Ruhr University Bochum.\n\nThe image above shows the huge extent of a spiral galaxy\u2019s magnetic field. The galaxy NGC 4217 is a star-forming, spiral galaxy, similar to our own Milky Way, 67 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major. The galaxy is seen edge-on in a visible-light image from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Kitt Peak National Observatory, and the magnetic field lines, shown as green, are revealed by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope.\n\nThe magnetic field lines extend as much as 22,500 light-years beyond the galaxy\u2019s disk. Scientists know that magnetic fields play an important role in many processes, such as star formation, within galaxies. However, it is not fully understood how such huge magnetic fields are generated and maintained. A leading explanation, called the dynamo theory, suggests that magnetic fields are generated by the motion of plasma within the galaxy\u2019s disk. Ideas about the cause of the kinds of large vertical extensions seen in this image are more speculative, and astronomers hope that further observations and more analysis will answer some of the outstanding questions.\n\n\u201cThis image clearly shows that when we think of galaxies like the Milky Way, we should not forget that they have galaxy-wide magnetic fields,\u201d said Yelena Stein, of the Centre de Donn\u00e9es astronomiques de Strasbourg, leader of the study.\n\nThe scientists who produced the image are reporting their results in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation, operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\nContacts and sources:\n\nDave Finley\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory\n\nPublication: \u201cCHANG-ES XXI.

The timeline offers insight into what has been a geologic dark age and will help scientists investigate abrupt environmental changes from the peak of the late Triassic and how they affected the plants and animals of the time.\n\nBefore the rock core was recovered, most of what was known about the Late Triassic came from searching for signs of the Chinle Formation on rocky outcrops such as this one, found throughout Petrified Forest National Park. The rock layers that make up the formation were deposited during the Late Triassic Period.", "link": "https://beforeitsnews.com/science-and-technology/2020/07/arizona-rock-offers-clues-to-the-chaotic-earth-of-200-million-years-ago-2979610.html", "author": ["Alton Parrish"]}, {"title": "Spider Monkey Groups as Collective Computers", "text": "The findings are published this week in the journal Frontiers in Robotics and AI . The researchers \u2014 from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the Santa Fe Institute \u2014 report that monkeys make use of the smarts of their group mates to inform their own decisions.\n\n\u201cBy forming these subgroups \u2014 constantly coming together and splitting \u2014 the spider monkeys develop a more thorough knowledge of their environment,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author, Gabriel Ramos-Fernandez at UNAM, who studies animal communication, social complexity and networks. \u201cThey seem to be pooling information about resources, so that as a group they know their environment better than any individual does on its own.\u201d\n\nRamos-Fernandez and his group recorded the interactions of 47 monkeys for five hours per day over two years. He says the monkeys, which are accustomed to being observed by people, typically formed subgroups of 2 to 17 animals, but those subgroups typically stayed together only for 1-2 hours. \u201cWe noted who was where, and with whom, at any given time,\u201d he says.\n\nTo understand how the monkeys to collectively compute team sizes, Ramos-Fernandez\u2019s team collaborated with SFI Professor Jessica Flack and SFI President David Krakauer. Flack leads SFI\u2019s Collective Computation Group, and Krakauer is co-developer of the collective computation ideas with Flack.\n\nThe researchers used an approach called inductive game theory, developed by Flack and Krakauer in collaboration with another SFI researcher, Simon DeDeo, to figure out what decision rules the spider monkeys use in deciding to stay on or leave a foraging team. In traditional game theory, researchers make assumptions about the strategies in play. Inductive game theory, in contrast, asks what strategies are the animals (or cells or neurons) actually using \u2014 what do we see in the data? Inductive Game Theory starts by specifying in advance a space of decision rules the study subjects \u2014 here spider monkeys \u2014 could be using given their cognitive and behavioral sophistication and, ideally, for which there is already some empirical support. The researchers search the data for evidence of these strategies and then ask how the strategies the individuals are found to use, combine to produce social structure.\n\n\u201cThis kind of methodology is useful for studying optimal foraging because it requires no a priori assumptions about benefits and costs,\u201d says Ramos-Fernandez. The researchers found individual monkeys\u2019 decisions to stay or leave a foraging team were influenced by the stay and leave decisions of other individuals on the team. This result suggests spider monkeys take into account the opinions of their group mates about what a good team size is and use those opinions to inform their own decision-making. The collective effects of these decisions produced a range of team sizes that worked well given the availability of fruiting trees in the monkeys\u2019 forest. But the researchers also found that the spider monkeys\u2019 \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d had room for improvement! The team sizes the monkeys collectively computed were not a perfect match to the availability of fruiting trees.\n\nA similar approach might help researchers understand other collective systems, including flocks of birds, groups of fish, or financial markets. Insights from this study also reinforce an idea in the collective intelligence literature that in decentralized systems when individual parts or agents have imperfect knowledge or only partial windows on the world, collective pooling of knowledge can be beneficial. Questions for future work include studying how individuals optimally combine the knowledge of group mates, depending on how diverse the group is, and how costly it is to make mistakes.\n\nRead the paper, \u201cCollective Computation in Animal Fission-Fusion Dynamics,\u201d in Frontiers in Robotics and AI (July 20, 2020)", "link": "https://beforeitsnews.com/animals-pets/2020/07/spider-monkey-groups-as-collective-computers-2465219.html", "author": ["Alton Parrish"]}, {"title": "Researchers 3D Print a Working Heart Pump with Real Human Cells", "text": "In a groundbreaking new study, researchers at the University of Minnesota have 3D printed a functioning centimeter-scale human heart pump in the lab. The discovery could have major implications for studying heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States killing more than 600,000 people a year.\n\nThis image used on the cover of the American Heart Association\u2019s Circulation Research journal is a 3D rendering of the printed heart pump developed at the University of Minnesota. The discovery could have major implications for studying heart disease.\n\n\n\nCredit: Kupfer, Lin, et al., University of Minnesota\n\nThe study is published and appears on the cover of Circulation Research, a publication of the American Heart Association.\n\nIn the past, researchers have tried to 3D print cardiomyocytes, or heart muscle cells, that were derived from what are called pluripotent human stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells are cells with the potential to develop into any type of cell in the body. Researchers would reprogram these stem cells to heart muscle cells and then use specialized 3D printers to print them within a three-dimensional structure, called an extracellular matrix. The problem was that scientists could never reach critical cell density for the heart muscle cells to actually function.\n\nIn this new study, University of Minnesota researchers flipped the process, and it worked.\n\n\u201cAt first, we tried 3D printing cardiomyocytes, and we failed, too,\u201d said Brenda Ogle, the lead researcher on the study and head of the Department of Biomedical Engineering in the University of Minnesota College of Science and Engineering. \u201cSo with our team\u2019s expertise in stem cell research and 3D printing, we decided to try a new approach. We optimized the specialized ink made from extracellular matrix proteins, combined the ink with human stem cells and used the ink-plus-cells to 3D print the chambered structure. The stem cells were expanded to high cell densities in the structure first, and then we differentiated them to the heart muscle cells.\u201d\n\nWhat the team found was that for the first time ever they could achieve the goal of high cell density within less than a month to allow the cells to beat together, just like a human heart.\n\n\u201cAfter years of research, we were ready to give up and then two of my biomedical engineering Ph.D. students, Molly Kupfer and Wei-Han Lin, suggested we try printing the stem cells first,\u201d said Ogle, who also serves as director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Stem Cell Institute. \u201cWe decided to give it one last try. I couldn\u2019t believe it when we looked at the dish in the lab and saw the whole thing contracting spontaneously and synchronously and able to move fluid.\u201d\n\nOgle said this is also a critical advance in heart research because this new study shows how they were able to 3D print heart muscle cells in a way that the cells could organize and work together. Because the cells were differentiating right next to each other it\u2019s more similar to how the stem cells would grow in the body and then undergo specification to heart muscle cells.\n\nCompared to other high-profile research in the past, Ogle said this discovery creates a structure that is like a closed sac with a fluid inlet and fluid outlet, where they can measure how a heart moves blood within the body. This makes it an invaluable tool for studying heart function.\n\n\u201cWe now have a model to track and trace what is happening at the cell and molecular level in pump structure that begins to approximate the human heart,\u201d Ogle said. \u201cWe can introduce disease and damage into the model and then study the effects of medicines and other therapeutics.\u201d\n\nThe heart muscle model is about 1.5 centimeters long and was specifically designed to fit into the abdominal cavity of a mouse for further study.\n\n\u201cAll of this seems like a simple concept, but how you achieve this is quite complex. We see the potential and think that our new discovery could have a transformative effect on heart research,\u201c Ogle said.\n\nIn addition to Ogle, Kupfer and Lin, other University of Minnesota researchers involved include University of Minnesota College of Science and Engineering faculty Professor Alena G. Tolkacheva (biomedical engineering) and Professor Michael McAlpine (mechanical engineering); University of Minnesota Medical School Associate Professor DeWayne Townsend (integrative biology and physiology); current and former University of Minnesota master\u2019s, Ph.D. students and postdocs Vasanth Ravikumar (electrical engineering), Kaiyan Qiu (Ph.D., mechanical engineering), and Didarul B. Bhuiyan (Ph.D.), Megan Lenz (M.S.), and Ryan R. Mahutga (biomedical engineering); and undergraduate student Jeffrey Ai (biomedical engineering).

Female mosquitoes, on the other hand, are able to bite.\n\nFemale Aedes aegypti mosquitoes require blood to produce eggs, making them the prime carriers of the pathogens that cause Zika and dengue fever in humans.\n\nCredit: James Gathany - US Department of Health and Human Services \u201cThe presence of a male-determining locus (M locus) establishes the male sex in Aedes aegypti and the M locus is only inherited by the male offspring, much like the human Y chromosome,\u201d said Zhijian Tu, a professor in the Department of Biochemistry in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. \u201cBy inserting Nix, a previously discovered male-determining gene in the M locus of Aedes aegypti, into a chromosomal region that can be inherited by females, we showed that Nix alone was sufficient to convert females to fertile males. This may have implications for developing future mosquito control techniques.\u201d These findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cWe also discovered that a second gene, named myo-sex, was needed for male flight. This work sheds light into the molecular basis of the function of the M locus, which contains at least 30 genes,\u201d said Azadeh Aryan, a research scientist in Tu\u2019s lab and the first author on the paper.\n\nJames Biedler (left), a research scientist in Zhijian Tu\u2019s lab; Azadeh Aryan (middle), the first author on the paper and a research scientist in Zhijian Tu\u2019s lab; and Maria Sharakhova (right), an assistant professor of entomology, discuss genetics in front of a dry erase board.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Alex Crookshanks for Virginia Tech. Aryan and colleagues generated and characterized multiple transgenic mosquito lines that expressed an extra copy of the Nix gene under the control of its own promoter. Maria Sharakhova, an assistant professor of entomology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Anastasia Naumencko, a former graduate research assistant, mapped the chromosomal insertion site of the extra copy of Nix. The Virginia Tech team, in collaboration with Zach Adelman\u2019s lab in the Department of Entomology at Texas A&M University and Chunhong Mao of the Biocomplexity Institute & Initiative at the University of Virginia, found that the Nix transgene alone, even without the M locus, was sufficient to convert females into males with male-specific sexually dimorphic features and male-like gene expression. \u201cNix-mediated sex conversion was found to be highly penetrant and stable over many generations in the laboratory, meaning that these characteristics will be inherited for generations to come,\u201d said Michelle Anderson, a former member of the Adelman and Tu labs and currently a senior research scientist at the Pirbright Institute in the United Kingdom. Although the Nix gene was able to convert the females into males, the converted males could not fly as they did not inherit the myo-sex gene, which is also located in the M locus. Knocking out myo-sex in wild-type males confirmed that the lack of myo-sex in the sex-converted males is the reason why they could not fly. Although flight is needed for mating, the sex-converted males were still able to father viable sex-converted progeny when presented with cold-anesthetized wild-type females.", "link": "https://beforeitsnews.com/health/2020/07/researchers-convert-female-mosquitoes-to-nonbiting-males-with-implications-for-mosquito-control-3033022.html", "author": ["Alton Parrish"]}, {"title": "Emergency: Pelosi Says She\u2019s Removing Trump & Making Herself President Under COG Martial Law", "text": "Emergency: Pelosi Says She\u2019s Removing Trump & Making Herself President Under COG Martial Law\n\n% of readers think this story is Fact.

There are books that get heavily promoted, wind up on bestseller lists everywhere before the ink has even dried on the pages, and you randomly see everyone at the airport carrying a copy under their arm as if they are being handed out for free with the plane tickets. And then there are books like the ones on this list that, if the establishment gets its way, you will never so much as lay eyes on.\n\n1. 63 Documents the Government Doesn\u2019t Want You to Read\n\nSure, the title makes it seem pretty obvious, but I\u2019ve got to wonder if people passed this one up largely based on the polarizing conspiracy figure that Jesse Ventura has become.\n\nThe book itself is filled with an eye-opening array (a primer if you will) of actual government documents that paint a picture of who our government does and does not represent. The people? No. Continuity of government, military-industrial complex and megacorporations? Absolutely.\n\nIt includes such amazing tidbits as \u201cThe CIA\u2019s Secret Assassination Manual,\u201d \u201cCIA \u2018Propaganda Notes\u2019 on the Kennedy Assassination,\u201d \u201cMilitary Experiments on Our Own Troops,\u201d \u201cFixing the Vote in Ohio,\u201d \u201cAn Internet Kill Switch?,\u201d and a bevy of false flag info from Operation Northwoods to 9/11 to Gulf of Tonkin and more.\n\nOh, and plenty of info on government drug running, torture, and covert operations among others. While Ventura imparts little thought-provoking nuggets of wisdom to set off each document, such as his question on the CIA: \u201cSo who runs this agency if the president doesn\u2019t?\u201d (a question I still can\u2019t find the answer to), these reproduced government pieces speak largely for themselves and will shock even seasoned conspiracy theorists\u2026 They simply have to be read to be believed.\n\nAnd speaking of the CIA\u2026\n\n2. The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence\n\nTo put it bluntly, the Central Intelligence Agency did not want this book to come out. Period.\n\nThis book was written by former CIA employee Victor L. Marchetti and former State Department intelligence analyst John D. Marks. In 1972, another CIA employee identifying himself as Robert P. B. Lohmann filed an affidavit in a federal court asking for an injunction against the book\u2019s release.\n\nIt seems Marchetti never gave an advanced copy over to the agency for review before publishing\u2026 which begs the question, how exactly did Lohmann end up with a copy to file the court papers over to begin with? Marchetti circulated maybe half a dozen copies in total and none were to Lohmann or his former employer\u2026\n\nThis is the first book that the federal government ever went to court to try and censor before publication.\n\nThat should tell you enough right there, but here\u2019s a little more. Marchetti referred to the \u201ccult of intelligence\u201d as a way of identifying the counterproductive CIA culture obsessed with \u201csecrecy, elitism, and lawlessness,\u201d and ultimately, a \u201csecret fraternity of the American political aristocracy.\u201d\n\nThe injunction was granted and after the agency fully reviewed the book, it designated some 339 portions to be deleted. That number was later bargained down to 168 after the authors filed their own lawsuit to challenge the government\u2019s censorship. The 1974 copy includes 168 blank spaces where those portions used to be.\n\nGuess we\u2019re left to fill in the blanks\u2026\n\n(For more in this vein, see also David Wise\u2019s The American Police State: The Government against the People)\n\n3. Tragedy & Hope: A History of the World in Our Time\n\nHistorian and author Carroll Quigley originally wrote this 1,300-page tome for a very limited audience, but instead found infamy in the conspiratorial camps opposed to world government and the Western establishment.\n\nIt doubles as an authoritative historical account of the 20th century and a revelation of many of the machinations of the hidden hand. Quigley, known for being a Bill Clinton mentor while at Georgetown, claims he was given access to the records of the Milner Group, a secret society sister organization to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Royal Institute of International Affairs.\n\nIn it, Quigley unveils for the first time the admitted workings of the Anglo-American Establishment who have manipulated all manner of world affairs from banking, to nation-building, to wars and military affairs, to grand political schemes for world government through the steering group of the Cecil Rhodes secret society.\n\nWhile you may not finish it in one sitting, it is an authoritative history lesson in the architecture of conspiracy. Just ask the John Birch Society (JBS) who played a big role in bringing this book out of the shadows and before the public.\n\nAfter publicizing much of the book\u2019s information about the plot for world government, Quigley\u2019s allies and backers tried to have the book removed from circulation entirely. However, the JBS secured the plates for printing and obtained permission to put it back in the public\u2019s hands, making sure it would continue to be widely available.\n\n(Also, don\u2019t miss Quigley\u2019s shorter companion piece The Anglo-American Establishment, which details the little-known but hugely significant operations in history of the Round Table groups who have changed world order forever.)\n\n4. The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World\n\nL. Fletcher Prouty who served as Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Kennedy years is best known for blowing the whistle on the CIA\u2019s role in the JFK assassination plot and inspiring the \u201cMr. X\u201d character in the Oliver Stone movie. In these pages, Prouty provides some important background history on the undoing of the United States of America.\n\nFrom his insider position, Prouty shows how former CIA head Allen W. Dulles and his allies lobbied for the National Security Act and the creation of the CIA itself, then transformed the agency from a restrained intelligence-gathering operation into an unleashed, unaccountable paragovernment entity that carried out countless coups, assassinations, and black ops both foreign and domestic.\n\nAfter reading how Dulles mutated the CIA to enable his own decade-long reign of power in pursuit of the establishment\u2019s secret agenda, you will not only understand why President Kennedy fired Dulles, but why America can never again be a Constitutional Republic until these shadow powers are absolved and the CIA is stopped. The government definitely does not want this information becoming common knowledge among its citizenry.\n\n5. Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare\n\nOnce you\u2019ve fallen this far down the rabbit hole, in a dark place where the signs of secret domination are everywhere, you\u2019ll eventually wind up at this book.\n\nFormer Associated Press reporter-turned-independent historian Michael Hoffman decodes the nexus between occult symbolism and numerous false flags, highly publicized events, and pop culture icons to reveal the secret signs of the Cryptocracy.\n\nBehind events both historical and modern are the often overlooked calling cards of secret society operations that not only point to their hand in manipulation, but a deeper symbolic meaning that flies over the heads of the population at large.\n\nFrom the Masons to Ancient Egypt, from secret Kabbalah sects to Skull & Bone and yes, the Illuminati, in addition to any number of other shadowy groups today, the use of mass mind control and cult ritual magic on and against the rest of us is put together masterfully.\n\nUltimately, it is the doctrine of \u201cRevelation of the Method\u201d used by the elite to socially engineer the population to its bidding and steer the world to a new age of global domination.\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://www.soulask.com/5-books-the-secret-government-hopes-youll-never-read/\n\nStories Contributed by N.

Dr. Bartlett says many patients experience rapid relief from Covid symptoms after the first treatment.\n\nIt\u2019s the same treatment that worked in crowded countries like Taiwan, Singapore and Japan who\u2019ve had very few deaths compared to countries that locked down. Therefore, Bartlett questions the effectiveness of mandatory masks, social distancing or a vaccine.\n\nHe explained that a vaccine is unnecessary because the mortality rate is so low and effective treatments already exist. And he emphasized that vaccines would be ineffective because of constant mutations to the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThe beautiful thing about the treatment that using is that no matter how many times it mutates it\u2019s universally going to work because it decreases the inflammation. It\u2019s a respiratory anti-inlammatory solution to a respiratory inlammatory problem.\u201d\n\nWatch the full interview below:\n\n[embedded content]\n\nSubscribe for natural health news to your inbox.

We discussed a number of items in terms of how the masters of the coup against President Trump and the people of the United States are going to dispose of people who oppose the governmental, societal, cultural and religious regime change. You are watching as everything is changing before our eyes. Playing chess is racist, the Bill of Rights is oppressive, church worship is being outlawed against, Walmart is open but you cannot go to the gym, you can to a casino in California but you cannot worship Jesus and \u201cif you ain\u2019t woke, you deserve to die.\u201d Celeste and myself discussed the nature of the deadly pathogen that will comprise the so-called second wave. It is NOT a virus. It is a \u201csmart\u201d weapon that can even be controlled from a remote location by unknown people. This will be one of the killshots that is coming our way. Celeste breaks down the composition of this genocidal weapon and what events will accompany the unleashing of this weapon upon humanity. I took a stab in the dark and asked Celeste a question about the fallen angels, the impregnation of earth women and legend of the giants. That questioned opened up Pandora\u2019s Box and Celeste\u2019s revelations will leave you spellbound and undoubtedly move many of you closer to Jesus. As the aware might expect, the name of Steve Quayle was brought up because of his vast experience related to this sensitive topic.

In the first video, City Prepping looks at the practical aspects and skills necessary to barter in a post-collapse environment. Bartering is the process of obtaining goods or services by direct exchange without the use of currency.\n\nIn times of economic instability or currency devaluation, it can be a great way to ensure the flow of necessary items and services into your household without using precious funds.\n\nHistorically, face-to-face exchanges between familiar parties were most common, but the Internet has opened up a new medium for bartering opportunities for both person-to-person exchanges and third-party facilitated transactions.\n\nTop Bartering Items to Hoard\n\nHere\u2019s a quick list of items with a long shelf-life that you may want to stockpile even though you won\u2019t be using them yourself.

Pento explains, \u201cNow, the valuation of stocks today are the most expensive in history, not around or tied or close. We are now 155% of GDP when you look at the market cap of equities. Stocks have never been more expensive.\u201d\n\nPento says stocks are going to probably go higher for now, but Pento predicts, \u201cI am going to run contrary to Wall Street, and I am going to tell you that you should see a significant run-up into the news of approved vaccines, new treatments and, of course, more stimulus. We\u2019ve got to borrow more money because $2.4 trillion wasn\u2019t enough. My models . . . say once this vaccine is validated and approved, this is going to be a selling opportunity for me and my investors.\u201d\n\nPento also thinks that most people will not take the vaccine, including Pento. Also, Pento says, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a one and done sort of thing,\u201d but something that will have to be given routinely like the annual flu shot.

Pento says, \u201cGet ready for stagflation, and that\u2019s what I call the \u2018Greater Depression.\u2019 That\u2019s when the real chaos begins. . . . You can make an argument that the Fed can fight deflation because it can continue to prop up asset prices. That\u2019s true, and it\u2019s a proven fact, but what does the Fed do when inflation starts to run intractable? When inflation becomes the problem, what can the Fed do? Promise to buy stocks and print more money? What can the Fed do? Print money to buy down interest rates when the economy is in full revolt? When money managers are shorting bonds and driving yields to the moon. No, the only thing they can do is stop printing money and promise to fight inflation. That\u2019s when you are going to get 6,000 on the Dow Jones Industrial average because there\u2019s nothing they can do. The Fed will be rendered impotent.\u201d\n\nPento suggests that people \u201cget out of all financial products with an adjustable interest rate\u201d and lock in at historically low fixed rates.\n\nIn closing, Pento says, \u201cThis is the best environment for gold I have ever seen in my career. This is in an environment where debt and deficits are surging. . . . So, debt is exploding, and what does gold like? It likes falling real interest rates.

Add your two cents.\n\n\n\n\n\nby N.Morgan\n\nWho knew something as simple as baking soda could treat a plethora of illnesses and diseases, like Cancer? Even the most aggressive cancers which have metastasized have been reversed with baking soda cancer treatments. Although chemotherapy is toxic to all cells, it represents the only measure that oncologists employ in their practice to almost all cancer patients. In fact, 9 out of 10 cancer patients agree to chemotherapy first without investigating other less invasive options.\n\nDoctors and pharmaceutical companies make money from it. That\u2019s the only reason chemotherapy is still used. Not because it\u2019s effective, decreases morbidity, mortality or diminishes any specific cancer rates. In fact, it does the opposite. Chemotherapy boosts cancer growth and long-term mortality rates and oncologists know it.\n\nA few years ago, the University of Arizona Cancer Center member Dr. Mark Pagel received a $2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the effectiveness of personalized baking soda cancer treatment for breast cancer. Obviously there are people in the know who have understood that sodium bicarbonate, that same stuff that can save a person\u2019s life in the emergency room in a heartbeat, is a primary cancer treatment option of the safest and most effective kind.\n\nStudies have shown that dietary measures to boost bicarbonate levels can increase the pH of acidic tumors without upsetting the pH of the blood and healthy tissues. Animal models of human breast cancer show that oral sodium bicarbonate does indeed make tumors more alkaline and inhibit metastasis. Based on these studies, plus the fact that baking soda is safe and well-tolerated, world-renowned doctors such as Dr. Julian Whitaker have adopted successful cancer treatment protocols as part of an overall nutritional and immune support program for patients who are dealing with the disease.\n\nThe Whitaker protocol uses 12 g (2 rounded teaspoons) of baking soda mixed in 2 cups water, along with a low-cal sweetener of your choice. (It\u2019s quite salty tasting.) Sip this mixture over the course of an hour or two and repeat for a total of three times a day. One man claims he has found a cure for cancer using baking soda and molasses and actually successfully treated his own disease by using baking soda.\n\nWhen taken orally with water, especially water with high magnesium content, and when used transdermally in medicinal baths, sodium bicarbonate becomes a first-line medicinal for the treatment of cancer, and also kidney disease, diabetes, influenza, and even the common cold. It is also a powerful buffer against radiation exposure, so everyone should be up to speed on its use. Everybody\u2019s physiology is under heavy nuclear attack from strong radioactive winds that are circling the northern hemisphere.\n\nDr. Robert J. Gillies and his colleagues have already demonstrated that pre-treatment of mice with baking soda results in the alkalinization of the area around tumors. The same researchers reported that bicarbonate increases tumor pH and also inhibits spontaneous metastases in mice with breast cancer.\n\nWhat is Baking Soda?\n\nBaking soda is a white crystalline solid that appears as a fine powder. It is also called cooking soda, bread soda, and bicarbonate of soda. Its chemical name is sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate.\n\nBaking soda is different from washing soda (sodium carbonate) although they share the same slightly salty and alkaline taste.\n\nThis widely used soda is commonly dissolved in mineral water and used as a leavening agent in baking. It works as a leavening agent by neutralizing the acidic components of batter. The neutralization releases carbon dioxide and leads to the \u201craising\u201d or expansion of baked foods.\n\nBaking soda has also been used to soften vegetables and to tenderize meat.\n\nAs a household chemical, baking soda is used as a cleaning agent. It is included in toothpaste for similar reasons where it serves as an antiseptic, acid-neutralizer, whitening agent, and plaque-removing agent as well as a cleaning agent.\n\nOther common personal hygiene products in which baking soda can be found include deodorants and shampoos.\n\nBaking Soda and pH Medicine\n\nThe pH of our tissues and body fluids is crucial and central because it affects and mirrors the state of our health or our inner cleanliness. The closer the pH is to 7.35-7.45, the higher our level of health and wellbeing. Staying within this range dramatically increases our ability to resist acute illnesses like colds and flues as well as the onset of cancer and other diseases. Keeping our pH within a healthy range also involves the necessary lifestyle and dietary changes that will protect us over the long term while the use of sodium bicarbonate gives us a jump-start toward increased alkalinity.\n\nThe pH scale is like a thermometer showing increases and decreases in the acid and alkaline content of fluids. Deviations above or below a 7.35-7.45 pH range in the tightly controlled blood can signal potentially serious and dangerous symptoms or states of disease.\n\nWhen the body can no longer effectively neutralize and eliminate the acids, it relocates them within the body\u2019s extra-cellular fluids and connective tissue cells directly compromising cellular integrity. Conversely, when the body becomes too alkaline from too much bicarbonate in the blood, metabolic alkalosis occurs, which can lead to severe consequences if not corrected quickly.\n\nJon Barron presents a way of looking at a pH that opens up one of the major benefits of alkaline water:\n\nHydrogen ions tie up oxygen. That means that the more acid a liquid is, the less available the oxygen in it. Every cell in our body requires oxygen for life and to maintain optimum health. Combine that with what we know about hydrogen ions and we see that the more acid the blood (the lower its pH), the less oxygen is available for use by the cells. Without going into a discussion of the chemistry involved, just understand that it\u2019s the same mechanism involved when acid rain \u201ckills\u201d a lake. The fish literally suffocate to death because the acid in the lake \u201cbinds up\u201d all of the available oxygen. It\u2019s not that the oxygen has gone anywhere; it\u2019s just no longer available. Conversely, if you raise the pH of the lake (make it more alkaline), oxygen is now available and the lake comes back to life. Incidentally, it\u2019s worth noting that cancer is related to an acid environment (lack of oxygen)\u2013the higher the pH (the more oxygen present in the cells of the body), the harder it is for cancer to thrive.\n\nUnderstanding this is important for two reasons: (1) it reveals one of the primary benefits of alkaline water\u2013more \u201cavailable\u201d oxygen in the system and (2) it explains why alkaline water helps fight cancer.\n\nHow Baking Soda Can Help \u201cCure\u201d Cancer\n\nBasically, malignant tumors represent masses of rapidly growing cells. The rapid rate of growth experienced by these cells means that cellular metabolism also proceeds at very high rates.\n\nTherefore, cancer cells are using a lot more carbohydrates and sugars to generate energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).\n\nHowever, some of the compounds formed from energy production include lactic acid and pyruvic acid. Under normal circumstances, these compounds are cleared and utilized as soon as they are produced. But cancer cells are experiencing metabolism at a much faster rate. Therefore, these organic acids accumulate in the immediate environment of the tumor.\n\nThe high level of extracellular acidity around the tumor is one of the chief driving forces behind the metastasis of cancer tumors.\n\nBasically, cancer cells need an acidic environment to grow and spread rapidly.\n\nSome cancer experts, therefore, believe that by buffering the tumor microenvironment with an alkalizing compound, the pH of tumors can be raised enough to starve them and stop their growth and spread.\n\nCuriously, this rather simple solution to cancer has been proven right.\n\nWhat is even more remarkable is that there is no need to cook up some fancy synthetic drug to lower the acidity in the immediate environment of the tumor. A simple, commonly obtained compound like sodium bicarbonate will do.\n\nObviously, it is desirable to deliver the sodium bicarbonate as close to the tumor as possible since its pH-raising effect is needed in the microenvironment of the tumor. Therefore, directly injecting sodium bicarbonate in the tumor site is considered a better solution than oral administration. However, oral sodium bicarbonate is just safer and can be readily used at home.\n\nA 2009 study published in the journal, Cancer Research, is among the first to confirm that the alkalinizing effect of sodium bicarbonate can indeed stop cancer.\n\nBy injecting sodium bicarbonate into a group of mice, the authors of the study were able to determine how the growth and spread of cancer tumors were effected by raising the pH of the organ affected by cancer.\n\nThe study results showed that baking soda indeed raised the pH and reduced spontaneous metastases in mice induced with breast cancer.\n\nThe researchers also determined that sodium bicarbonate works by raising the pH outside cells and not within cells. This is an important finding because it suggests that sodium bicarbonate does not interfere with cellular metabolism even as it makes the microenvironment unconducive for tumor growth.\n\nOther findings from this study show that baking soda:\n\nReduced the involvement of the lymph node on the transport of cancer cells\n\nDoes not lower the levels of circulating tumor cells\n\nReduced the involvement of the liver and, therefore, the spread of tumor cells to other organs\n\nInhibit the colonization of other organs by circulating tumor cells\n\nThe Baking Soda Formula for Cancer\n\nTo make the baking soda natural cancer remedy at home, you need maple syrup, molasses or honey to go along with the baking soda.\n\nIn Dr. Sircus\u2019 book, he documented how one patient used baking soda and blackstrap molasses to fight the prostate cancer that had metastasized to his bones. On the first day, the patient mixed 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 1 teaspoon of molasses in a cup of water.\n\nHe took this for another 3 days after which his saliva pH read 7.0 and his urine pH read 7.5.\n\nEncouraged by these results, the patient took the solution 2 times on day 5 instead of once daily. And from day 6 \u2013 10, he took 2 teaspoons each of baking soda and molasses twice daily.\n\nBy the 10th day, the patient\u2019s pH had risen to 8.5 and the only side effects experienced were headaches and night sweat (similar to cesium therapy).\n\nThe next day, the patient had a bone scan and too other medical tests. His results showed that his PSA (prostate-specific antigen, the protein used to determine the severity of prostate enlargement and prostate cancer) level was down from 22.3 at the point of diagnosis to 0.1.\n\nAnother baking soda formula recommends mixing 90 teaspoons of maple syrup with 30 teaspoons of baking soda.\n\nTo do this, the maple syrup must be heated to become less viscous. Then the baking syrup is added and stirred for 5 minutes until it is fully dissolved.\n\nThis preparation should provide about 10-day worth of the baking soda remedy. 5 \u2013 7 teaspoons per day is the recommended dose for cancer patients.\n\nCare should be taken when using the baking soda remedy to treat cancer. This is because sustaining a high pH level can itself cause metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte imbalance. These can result in edema and also affect the heart and blood pressure.\n\nOne does not have to be a doctor to practice pH medicine. Every practitioner of the healing arts and every mother and father needs to understand how to use sodium bicarbonate. Bicarbonate deficiency is a real problem that deepens with age so it really does pay to understand and appreciate what baking soda is all about.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://preventdisease.com/news/15/070215_Oncologists-Dont-Like-Baking-Soda-Cancer-Treatment-Too-Effective-Cheap.shtml\n\ncancertutor.com\n\nphkillscancer.com\n\ndrsircus.com\n\ndrleonardcoldwell.com\n\ndrwhitaker.com\n\nDave Mihalovic is a Naturopathic Doctor who specializes in vaccine research, cancer prevention and a natural approach to treatment.\n\nStories Contributed by N.

Unfortunately, the RF transmits outwardly in ALL directions \u2013 anywhere inside the house that has line of site to the glass portion of the smart meter will be subject to RF exposure.

Morgan"]}, {"title": "Unsolved Mystery of the Rh-Negative Blood Genetic Origins (Videos)", "text": "\n\n\n\nby N.Morgan\n\nThe Rh-Negative blood factor has remained a mystery since almost the beginning of time. Nearly 85% of all human beings have RH positive blood. This merely indicates that their red blood cells contain a substance called the Rhesus (rhesus) blood factor. Simply put, their positive blood contains a protein that can be linked to the Rhesus monkey.\n\nIt is acknowledged that blood factors are transmitted with more exactitude than any other human or animal characteristic. It is not generally known from where the negative RH factor derived, although tantalizing evidence exists that it arrises from genetic experimentation a little over 5,000 years ago.\n\nThe highest concentration of RH negative blood occurs in the Basque people of Northern Spain and Southern France, and in the Eastern/Oriental Jews. Only 15% of the entire world\u00b4s population is known to have the RH negative blood factor. While it is known that RH negative blood \u2013 (type \u2018O\u2019) is the purest blood known to mankind, it is not known from where the negative factor originates, as it is generally theorized by evolutionists that there is an unbroken bloodline from early human prototypes (pre-humans) to present-day human beings.\n\nAs previously mentioned, \u2018Rh-negative\u2019 blood indicates no protein connections exist to the Rhesus monkey, whereas \u2018RH positive\u2019 blood does carry protein linked to the Rhesus monkey \u2013 hence the \u2018RH\u2019 designation, ie. rhesus. All other earthly primates have this RH factor. Thus if all humans evolved from that line, all would have the RH factor. Obviously, that is not the case. Therefore, there must have been some manner of intervention giving rise to Rh-negative blood groups.\n\nBlood type \u2018O\u2019 is the most common of the blood groups. When we separate the \u2018O\u2019 types into \u2018negative\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 we find that \u2018O\u2019 negative (the universal donor blood) constitutes less than 7% of the world\u00b4s population. Science at this very time is attempting to create a synthetic RH negative \u2018O\u2019 blood but without success. For while the protein in positive blood can be cloned, that of negative blood cannot \u2013 which is quite interesting, and maybe indicative of an alien origin, or more probable, from early genetic experimentation during previous advanced human civilization(s).\n\nIf the RH negative factor does not derive from any known earthly link (seemingly outside of the theorized evolutionary process) \u2013 from where did it originate? Geneticists generally claim the RH-negative factor is a mutation of unknown origin which apparently happened only a few thousand years ago. These \u00b4negative\u00b4 blooded people spread heavily into the area of what is now Spain, England, Ireland, France, and later into America, Canada, and Australia. Basque peoples contain the largest concentration of known \u2018O\u2019 negative blooded people today because, they, for the most part, have confined themselves to one area, whereas the Celtic people have branched out among all of the new worlds.\n\nWHAT DOES THE ABSENCE OF RHESUS MONKEY FACTOR MEAN?\n\nNo solid scientific explanation exists as to how or why Rh- blood came about. It is presumed to be the result of a random mutation. Have you ever felt you were weird or different? It may be due to your DNA \u2026 85% of humans have the monkey gene (RH+) and 15% do not (RH-) and maybe have an alien gene instead. RH- people are characterized by higher IQs, sensitive vision, lower body temperatures, sensitivity to heat and sunlight, psychic power, ability to stopwatches and electrical appliances, and having extra vertebrae. This film explores the possibility that we were bred as a slave race for labor, since 97% of our genetic code is disabled, with only 3% left for us to survive.\n\nOxygenate and Hydrate your Cells to Boost Vitality!\n\nDo you Yawn often, Snore, have Restless Sleep? Try our Oxygenated Humic Fulvic Mineral Complex!\n\nRH NEGATIVE BLOOD\n\nInterestingly, popular sciences endeavor to attribute Rh-neg blood groups to \u201cmutations.\u201d A solid alternative case may be extended to the conclusion that Rh-neg is NOT a mutation, but possibly the original human blood group. This, however, does not reflect tenured thought, and thus has never been adequately researched.\n\nThat there was a group of \u201cpure\u201d humans, not directly related to the evolutionary processes on Earth, is a distinct possibility. This reasoning would suggest that the original humans on our planet were not directly related to the apes, but at some point were \u201cMADE\u201d or \u201cgenetically engineered\u201d to give such an impression.\n\nPerhaps it was never intended that the Rh-positives become the dominant species. That through some as a yet undetermined epoch, the genetically impure group gradually became the controlling species, except for several remote enclaves, initiated a wide-ranging genocidal pogrom, effectively wiping out those who gave birth to them.\n\nAll of which begs the questions: What reasons were the sub-species created, what was the process of conquest, what was the duration, and does it continue?\n\nBLOOD TYPES CONSPIRACY & RH FACTOR\n\nItems from the Science Community\n\nHere are a few tidbits about this blood thing. In ALL blood groups there exists a common microbe that in essence is THE LIFE FORCE ITSELF. During experiments that our team conducted we heated the blood to 700 degrees F and also put it in Liquid Nitrogen. This microbe which is visible only with a highly modified dark field microscope that was custom built for us was STILL ALIVE. We have also tested this on \u00b4mummy dust\u00b4. This microbe is STILL alive after 5000 years plus when the mummy dust is placed in a ph perfect solution the same as the \u201clive blood\u201d, it returns back to \u00b4life\u00b4.\n\nThe Draco (Reptilian) with the \u201cO\u201d RH-blood has unique properties because of the polarity of the blood cells. Blood is electrical/magnetic/chemical-based. The relationship of all three must be kept at a specific PH balance of 7.0 to 7.2. The problem with the \u201cO\u201d RH-systems is this, the stomach has TOO MUCH acid in it for proper digestion so they had to resort to taking the trace mineral in THRU THE SKIN aka \u00b4sitting in a bathtub full of minerals\u00b4.\n\nThen after generations of this type of eating the digestive systems ceased to function properly. This is why Type \u201cO\u201d blood groups have so much trouble with \u00b4indigestion\u00b4. It\u2019s in your genes because of this Draco influence. I am currently putting together a geographical reference to the placement of just how many people carry this genetic code in their blood.\n\nDO NOT EVER TAKE A BLOOD TRANSFUSION.\n\nThe main reason for this has to do with cellular/genetic/galactic memory of blood. This is coded into the entire structure of the blood. All the emotions that the donor has felt during his entire lifetime are part of the blood. This cannot be filtered out.\n\nFor example, if you get the heart of a man who died in a car accident, all the cells of that organ have the memory of the accident and every emotion that was felt while dying. These emotions confuse your own coding and then mass internal confusion happens at the cellular level and the order turns into chaos. No shrink at $100 per hour is gonna fix that, ever.\n\nMany \u201cO\u201d Rh-negative people on the planet are also holding karma from the Draco Empire. Some of you have chosen to come to earth to help balance that karma. Some who were \u201cO\u201d Rh-negative have switched to \u201cA\u201d RH positive which is the TOTAL OPPOSITE to \u201cO\u201d RH-neg.\n\nOur worldwide team, over a 10-year time period, has gathered hundreds of thousands of blood samples. We are only now beginning to understand what is happening to humans, as indicated by blood-types, as Earth nears Nexus.\n\nThose having the hardest time being the \u201cO\u201d Rh- blood groups with alien (to Earth) heritage. I cannot reveal at this time just how this is done but I can say this, we are at a crossroads as far as our ability to affect our OUTER world by changing the INNER world of the blood. Every \u00b4disease\u00b4 is nothing more than a reflection of the INNER terrain of the blood. As the blood is intimately integrated with the life force, this explains the feeling that we have when working with people that have the same blood type.\n\nTo answer the questions that I am sure will come up, The book Eat Right For Your Blood Type is correct only in the foods, but he does not take into consideration the GALACTIC history of the blood in relation to the person. That is what I have been working on. As far as his history as to how the different blood groups came about is pure hogwash. The different blood groups are from different parts of the Galaxy. More of this is going to be revealed as more understanding of REAL RNA/DNA Coding is researched.\n\nWhen you measure the heart harmonics of people with \u201cO\u201d RH-neg blood, they are usually lower if they are smokers and heavy red meat-eaters. The ones who eat fish and vegetables are in the normal range. This is a very new science and there are but a handful of people who are involved in this research.\n\nHere is something for all of you to think about:\n\nThere is a race of people in a remote region of China that are only 3 \u2013 4 feet tall and speak a language spoken only within that remote area. When they try to move from this region to lower geological elevations, THEY DIE. Their skin color is ashy white. Their eyes are very small almost like slits.\n\nTHE pH REGULATORY SYSTEM OF THE BODY\n\nThe pH balance of the human bloodstream is recognized by all medical physiology texts as one of the most important biochemical balances in all of human body chemistry.\n\npH is the acronym for \u201cPotential Hydrogen\u201d. In definition, it is the degree of concentration of hydrogen ions in a substance or solution. It is measured on a logarithmic scale from 0 to 14. Higher numbers mean a substance is more alkaline in nature and there is a greater potential for absorbing more hydrogen ions. Lower numbers indicate more acidity with less potential for absorbing hydrogen ions.\n\nOur body pH is very important because pH controls the speed of our body\u00b4s biochemical reactions. It does this by controlling the speed of enzyme activity as well as the speed that electricity moves through our body.\n\nThe higher (more alkaline) the pH of a substance or solution, the more electrical resistance that substance or solution holds. Therefore, electricity travels slower with higher pH. All biochemical reactions and electrical (life) energy is under pH control.\n\nIf we say something has an acid pH, we are saying it is hot and fast. As an example, look at the battery of your car. It\u00b4s an acid battery. On cold days you want it to be hot and ready, and you want your car to start fast.\n\nAlkaline pH on the other hand, biochemically speaking, is slow and cool. Compare it to an alkaline battery in a flashlight. You want that battery to be cool, and to burn out slowly.\n\nHere is an example of how pH can control. Look around you at society in general.\n\nDo you see people getting exhausted, burned out, and quick to anger? Do you see a rise in violence? In part, it could be due to the fact that people today lean to an acid pH. As a society, we are running hot and fast. How did we get there? We guzzle coffee for breakfast.\n\nThere are about 5000 known blood factors, and all of these must contribute to the complete picture. But the Rh-negative blood is the place to start our search.\n\nAs you can see the vast majority of RH- people come from the Basque people of France and Spain, and then Europe has the second-highest percentage. We can surmise that the RH- blood type originates out of Europe and has spread over to other countries that contain European ancestry heritage. The RH- recessive alleles (+/-) make up approximately 60% of the Basque people and 40% of the Europeans, so that means that a higher percentage of RH+ people in Europe are carrying the genetics of the RH- factor in their DNA.\n\n\u201cNo one has tried to explain where the Rh negative people came from. Most, familiar with blood factors, admit that these people must at least be a mutation if not descendants of a different ancestor. If we are a mutation, what caused the mutation? Why does it continue with the exact characteristics? Why does it so violently reject the Rh factor, if it was in their own ancestry? Who was this ancestor? Difficulties in determining ethnology are largely overcome by the use of blood group data, for they are a single gene characteristic and not affected by the environment.\n\nThe Basque people of Spain and France have the highest percentage of Rh-negative blood. About 30% have (rr) Rh negative and about 60% carry one (r) negative gene. The average among most people is only 15%-Rh negative, while some groups have very little. The Oriental Jews of Israel, also have a high percent Rh negative, although most other Oriental people have only about 1% Rh-negative. The Samaritans and the Black Cochin Jew also have a high percentage of Rh-negative blood, although again the Rh-negative blood is rare among most black people.\n\nThe Basque people are also known for having the oldest language in Europe, and the origins of the Basque language are unknown. The languages in neighboring countries in Europe show no resemblance to the Basque language, so this has become a real mystery to the linguist.\n\nThe Celtic people of Ireland and Great Britain also have high incidences of the RH- factor and it has recently been proven that there is a genetic link between the Basque and the Celts. This research proves that the Celtic people came from the Basque regions of France and Spain and a group must have migrated over to the islands of Great Britain.\n\nHere are a few \u201cfun\u201d facts shared by many within the Rhesus negative groups:\n\n\u2022 A feeling of not belonging\n\n\u2022 Truth seekers\n\n\u2022 Sense of a \u201cMission\u201d in life\n\n\u2022 Empathy & Compassion for Mankind\n\n\u2022 An extra rib or vertebra.\n\n\u2022 Higher than average IQ\n\n\u2022 ESP Ability\n\n\u2022 Love of Space & Science\n\n\u2022 More sensitive vision & other senses.\n\n\u2022 Increased of psychic/intuitive abilities\n\n\u2022 Cannot be cloned\n\n\u2022 Lower body temperature\n\n\u2022 Higher blood pressure (some say lower, either way, one extreme to another never quite right)\n\n\u2022 Predominance of green or hazel eyes that change color\n\n\u2022 Red or reddish tint to hair color\n\n\u2022 Increased sensitivity to heat & sunlight\n\n\u2022 Unexplained Scares\n\n\u2022 Piercing Eyes\n\n\u2022 Tend to be Healers\n\n\u2022 Empathetic Illnesses\n\n\u2022 Ability to disrupt electrical devices\n\n\u2022 Prone to Alien Abductions\n\n\u2022 Experience unexplained phenomenon\n\n\u2022 Physic Dreams and/or Ability\n\nlink to www.rhnegativeregistry.com\n\n\u201cROYAL DISEASE\u201d\n\nGlobal Blood suppliers managed to infect or kill 90% of Hemophiliacs in the world by providing them with tainted blood. If Hemophiliac is the \u201cRoyal Disease\u201d, woe to generations of boys, who could not be king. Worldwide, over 120,000 men, women and boys\u2026a true \u201cgenetic holocaust\u201d\u2026are now infected with HIV worldwide\u2026due to tainted blood transfusions, At least 25,000 have died.\n\nIn some areas, the Rh-Negative blood factor is referred to as \u201cBlood Royale\u201d or \u201cRoyal Blood\u201d. For centuries, European royalty has been inflicted with Hemophilia or \u201cbleeders disease\u201d. Apparently, Queen Victoria was a \u201ccarrier\u201d of Hemophilia and gave it to all of her children who then intermarried and infected the bloodlines of every throne in Europe during the 1800s and 1900s.\n\nAs a direct result, Hemophilia became known as the \u201cRoyal Disease\u201d. To keep this in perspective, only about 5% of all \u201croyalty\u201d have Rh-Factor negative blood\u2026which means \u201cless than the general population. That would indicate that the vast majority of \u201crulers\u201d and \u201cmonarchs\u201d are NOT Rhesus-factor negative. Is this by chance? or by genetic engineering called \u201carranged marriages\u201d?\n\nFor all practical purposes, the cultural group with the highest rates of Rh-negative blood is the \u201cBerbers\u201d of Morocco. In an earlier meme, I indicated that the highest concentration of Rh-Factor Negative was from Iraq. It seems that the Berbers may actually have originated thousands of years ago, from the border of Syria and Iraq.\n\nIf European royalty is no disposed to intermarriage with Rh-Negs, it may be because they are avoiding the \u201cArab\u201d bloodline? Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. It appears that the Basque Rh-neg factors come from ancient Berber seafarers as early as 8,000 BC! Perhaps, many of the \u201ccave paintings\u201d may be attributed to \u201cstrangers\u201d of great artistic ability that migrated into the area.\n\nIs \u201chyper-creativity\u201d a \u201csymptom\u201d of Rh-Negative Blood? Artists? Entertainers? Who knows\u2026but if European Royalty refuses to marry into the Rh-Negative bloodline it means one thing\u2026Rh-Neg people are a \u201ccompeting royal line\u201d.\n\nHow do you get rid of it once and for all? Although the British would love for you to think that Victoria was the world\u2019s first carrier\u2026don\u2019t be confused. It was he Hapsburg\u2019s disease. Was Victoria a Hapsburg?\n\nThe unofficial motto of the Hapsburg family was \u201cBella gerant alii, tu, felix Austria, nubes!\u201d (\u201dWhere others must fight wars, you, fortunate Austria, marry!).\n\nIt\u2019s curious that \u201cmarriage\u201d can be a \u201cdynastic\u201d undertaking but it can also be a perverse form of \u201cbio-warfare\u201d or \u201cgenetic warfare\u201d. In fact, the disease was much more ancient.\n\nThe \u201cFather of Surgery\u201d was El Zarhawi or Albucasis, 1013-1106. Albucasis described a family where only males died from blood loss after the most trivial of injury.\n\nhttp://www.unhas.ac.id/~rhiza/saintis/zahravi.html\n\nHis full name was Abul Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas al-Zahravi. He was born and brought up in Zahra (zorro?) , the royal suburb of Cordova (Arabic Qurtuba), the capital of Muslim Spain. As we know from the history, Zahra competed in grandeur and magnificence with Baghdad. Al-Zahravi served in the capacity of the court physician to King Al-Hakam-II of Spain. After a long and distinguished medical career, he died in 1013 C.E.\n\nAs an inventor of many surgical instruments, Al-Zahravi is famous for developing instruments for internal examination of the ear, internal inspection of the urethra, and for applying or removing foreign bodies from the throat. He introduced such new procedures as cauterization of wounds, crushing stones inside the bladder, the vivisection, and dissection.\n\nHe applied the cauterization procedure to as many as 50 different operations. In addition, Al-Zahravi discussed the preparation of medicines and the application of such techniques as sublimation and decantation. He prescribed the use of diuretics, sudorifics, purgatives, the absorption of pure wine and hot baths. Al-Zahavi was the first to give a detailed description of hemophilia and was the first to use silk thread for stitching wounds.\n\nSo, you begin to wonder if the good doctor was treating an \u201cArab\u201d family in Moorish Spain for the disease. Then you begin to wonder just where supposed blue blood as Victoria got her \u201cArab Royalty Disease\u201d??? Was it a disease of Spanish Royalty?\n\nIn other words, was marriage to Victoria\u2019s daughters a way to kill or weaken future \u201cnon-Hapsburg\u201d kings\u2026since most males only contract the disease from their mothers? Still, Hemophilia was in Royalty long before Victoria.\n\nVictoria\u2019s daughters passed the disease into the Spanish, German, and Russian Royal lines and threatened the thrones of all of Europe\u2019s major powers. It would appear that Victoria is actually a direct descendant of Ferdinand of Castille, who retook the city of Castille in 1236, where the surgeon Abulcasis had counseled King Hakam II about a family who\u2019s sons died easily.\n\nSOME CRAZY STUFF FOLKS!\n\nI just want to raise awareness and give a heads up to people out there that might know someone experiencing strange SYMPTOMS or have heard about this. I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with this as a precaution so you can RECOGNIZE it when you hear about it or experience it because awareness is the first way to fight the scumbags that created this or apart of what seems to be nefarious\u2026 however this entire issue and origin is still unknown as to whether its intended to have a positive or negative effect in the bigger picture. Is this a non-fictional XMEN type of evolutionary virus or a hoax\u2026 no one knows, but there does seem to be strange sh#t going on with all this more than anyone realizes right now. BE VIGILANT because KNOWLEDGE is POWER.\n\nEvidently one of the possible anomalies or diseases that might be connected is called MORGELLONS DISEASE which are technically micro-BUGS that are ELECTRICAL\u2026\n\nBut it appears to allegedly be some type of a NANO-TECH Virus that affects those with RH NEGATIVE BLOOD and is said to be ALIEN in origin or MILITARY TECH virus/disease of some kind THEY\u2019VE introduced many years ago into the human population possibly VIA CHEMTRAILS or that CHEMTRAILS are somehow also an ACTIVATOR of it\u2026. and seeing how there are more and more chemtrails these days, this may be ALL CONNECTED and one of the purposes of CHEMTRAILS are intended for.\n\nIt may be a method of DEPOPULATION beginning with infecting those GRADUALLY who are RH NEGATIVE.\n\nCould this be linked to MASS ANIMAL DEATHS as well in any way?\n\nMost do not know that as RHO-Neg individuals, they are tracked throughout their whole lives by world-wide governmental agencies interested in understanding the genesis of this group, and for other more complex societal purposes.

Morgan"]}, {"title": "Welcome to an Island Where People Forget to Die & Diseases Like Lung Cancer Mysteriously Disappear (Video)", "text": "\n\n\n\nby N.Morgan\n\nOn the beautiful and ancient Greek island of Ikaria, people are far more likely to live to 100, and diseases like lung cancer mysteriously disappear.\n\nOne day in 1976, Stamatis Moraitis of Boynton Beach, Florida, felt short of breath. Climbing stairs was a chore; he had to quit working midday. After reviewing his X-rays, his doctor concluded that Moraitis had lung cancer. As he recalls, nine other doctors confirmed the diagnosis. They gave him nine months to live. He was in his mid-60s. Moraitis, a Greek war veteran who had arrived in the United States in 1943, considered staying and seeking aggressive treatment.\n\nThat way, he and his wife, Elpiniki, could be close to his adult children. But he decided to return to his native island, Ikaria, where he could be buried with his ancestors in a cemetery that overlooked the Aegean Sea. He and Elpiniki moved in with his elderly parents, into a tiny, whitewashed house on two acres of stepped vineyards on the north side of Ikaria.\n\nAt first, Moraitis spent his days in bed. On Sunday mornings, he hobbled up the hill to a tiny Greek Orthodox chapel where his grand\u00adfather once served as a priest. When his childhood friends started showing up every afternoon, they\u2019d talk for hours, an activity that invariably involved a bottle or two of locally produced wine. I might as well die happy, he thought.\n\nIn the ensuing months, Moraitis started to feel stronger. One day he planted some vegetables in the garden. He didn\u2019t expect to live to harvest them, but he enjoyed being in the sunshine, breathing the ocean air.\n\nSix months came and went. He didn\u2019t die. Easing himself into the island routine, he woke up when he felt like it, worked in the vineyards until midafternoon, made lunch, and then took a long nap. In the evenings, he often walked to the local tavern, where he played dominoes past midnight. His health continued to improve. He added a couple of rooms to his parents\u2019 home so his children could visit. He built up the vineyard until it produced 400 gallons of wine a year.\n\nFor more than a decade, I\u2019ve been organizing a study of places where people live longest. In 2008, my colleagues Michel Poulain, Ph.D., a Belgian demographer, and Gianni Pes, MD, a researcher at the University of Sassari in Italy, and I began investigating Ikaria. Ninety-nine square miles and home to almost 10,000 Greek nationals, the island lies about 30 miles off the western coast of Turkey. We concluded that people on Ikaria were, in fact, two and a half times as likely to reach age 90 as Americans. Ikarian men, in particular, are nearly four times as likely as their American counterparts to reach 90. Ikarians were also living about eight to ten years longer before succumbing to cancers and cardiovascular disease, and they suffered less depression and about a quarter the rate of dementia.\n\nLife on Ikaria\n\nSeeking to learn more about the island\u2019s reputation for long-lived residents, I called on Ilias Leriadis, one of Ikaria\u2019s few physicians. On an outdoor patio, he set a table with kalamata olives, hummus, heavy Ikarian bread, and wine.\n\n\u201cPeople stay up late here,\u201d Dr. Leriadis said. \u201cWe wake up late and always take naps. We simply don\u2019t care about the clock.\u201d\n\nDr. Leriadis also talked about local \u201cmountain tea,\u201d made from dried herbs endemic to the island, which is enjoyed as an end-of-the-day cocktail. He mentioned wild marjoram, sage, a type of mint tea, rosemary, and a drink made from boiling dandelion leaves and adding a little lemon. The teas double as traditional Greek remedies. Wild mint fights gingivitis and gastrointestinal disorders; rosemary is used to treat gout; artemisia is thought to improve blood circulation.\n\nWhen Ioanna Chinou, a professor at the University of Athens School of Pharmacy and one of Europe\u2019s top experts on the bioactive properties of herbs, tested Ikaria\u2019s most commonly used herbs, she found that they showed strong antioxidant properties. Most also contained mild diuretics, which doctors use to treat hypertension. Perhaps by drinking tea, Ikarians have gently lowered their blood pressure all their lives.\n\nOn a trip the year before, I visited a slate-roofed house built into the slope at the top of a hill. I had come here after hearing of a couple married for more than 75 years. Thanasis and Eirini Karimalis clapped their hands at the thrill of having a visitor.\n\nThe couple was born in a nearby village; they married in their early 20s and raised five children on Thanasis\u2019s pay as a lumberjack. Their daily routine: Wake naturally, work in the garden, have a late lunch, nap. At sunset, they either visited neighbors or neighbors visited them. Their diet was also typical: a breakfast of goat\u2019s milk, wine, sage tea or coffee, honey, and bread. Lunch was almost always beans, potatoes, greens (fennel, dandelion, or a spinachlike green called horta), and seasonal vegetables from their garden; dinner was bread and goat\u2019s milk. At Christmas and Easter, they would slaughter the family pig and enjoy small portions of larded pork for the next several months.\n\nJust after sunset, another couple walked in, carrying a glass amphora of homemade wine. The ninety-somethings cheek-kissed one another and settled around the table. They gossiped, drank wine, and occasionally erupted into laughter.\n\nThe Healthy Magic of the Ikarian Diet\n\nMeanwhile, my colleagues and additional researchers fanned out across the island and asked nonagenarians a battery of lifestyle questions. They were joined by Antonia Trichopoulou from the University of Athens Medical School, an expert on the Mediterranean diet.\n\nShe estimated that the Ikarian diet, compared with the standard American diet, might yield up to four additional years of life expectancy. Low intake of saturated fats from meat and dairy was associated with a lower risk of heart disease; olive oil reduced bad cholesterol and raised good cholesterol. Goat\u2019s milk contained serotonin-boosting tryptophan and was easily digestible for older people. Some wild greens had ten times as many antioxidants as red wine.\n\nWine\u2014in moderation\u2014prompts the body to absorb more flavonoids, a type of antioxidant. Local sourdough bread might reduce a meal\u2019s glycemic load. You could even argue that potatoes contributed to heart-healthy potassium, vitamin B6, and fiber. And because islanders eat greens from their gardens, they consume fewer pesticides and more nutrients.\n\nIkarians\u2019 sleep and sex habits might also affect their long lives. A 2008 paper by the University of Athens Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health found that napping at least three days weekly was associated with a 37 percent reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease. In a preliminary study of older Ikarian men, 80 percent claimed to have sex regularly, a habit also linked to longevity. A quarter of that group said they were doing so with \u201cgood duration\u201d and \u201cachievement.\u201d\n\nWhen Thea Parikos moved from America to Ikaria and opened a guesthouse, she stopped shopping for most groceries, instead planting a huge garden that provided most of their fruits and vegetables. She lost weight without trying to. I asked her if she thought her diet would make her family live longer. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t think about it that way. It\u2019s bigger than that.\u201d\n\nAlthough unemployment is high\u2014perhaps as high as 40 percent\u2014most everyone has access to a family garden and livestock, Parikos told me. People who work might have several jobs. Someone involved in tourism, for example, might also be a painter. \u201cWe may not have money for luxuries, but we will have food on the table and still have fun with family and friends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe may not be in a hurry to get work done during the day, so we work into the night. At the end of the day, we don\u2019t go home to sit on the couch.\u201d\n\nAsk the very old on Ikaria how they\u2019ve lived past 90, and they\u2019ll usually talk about the clean air and the wine. Or, as one 101-year-old woman put it, \u201cWe just forget to die.\u201d They have no idea how they\u2019ve lived so long.\n\nBut if you pay careful attention, it appears that a dozen subtly powerful, mutually enhancing, and pervasive factors are at work. It\u2019s easy to get enough rest if no one else wakes up early and the village goes dead during afternoon nap time. It helps that the cheapest, most accessible foods are also the most healthful\u2014and that your ancestors have spent centuries developing ways to make them taste good. It\u2019s hard to get through the day without walking up 20 hills. You\u2019re not likely to ever feel the stress of arriving late. And at day\u2019s end, you\u2019ll share a cup of herbal tea with your neighbor. Even if you\u2019re anti\u00adsocial, you\u2019ll never be entirely alone.\n\nThe last time I spoke to Moraitis was in July 2012. Elpiniki had died in the spring, and now he lived alone. I had one last question: How does he think he recovered from lung cancer?\n\n\u201cIt just went away,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually went back to America about 25 years after moving here to see if the doctors could explain it.\u201d I had heard this part of the story before. It had become a piece of the folklore of Ikaria. Still, I asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy doctors were all dead.\u201d\n\nMoraitis died in his home on February 3, 2013, at the age of 98, according to official records. By his own reckoning, he was 102.\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://www.rd.com/article/island-people-forget-to-die/\n\nStories Contributed by N.

This is a special edition of The Sumerian Epic which combines the first 3 Episodes into an hour and a half long movie, with an additional 7 minutes of never before seen bonus footage scattered throughout the feature! The film at its core opens the floodgates of questions regarding the mysterious yet popular \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d of Nibiru, the supposed hidden planet that lurks in the farthest reaches of our outer solar system. It was nearly 50 years ago that the theory of Nibiru first reached the masses through Zechariah Sitchin\u2019s first book \u201cThe Twelfth Planet\u201d, which sought to explain that the oldest texts on the planet, the Cuneiform tablets of Sumer, were actually a series of encoded legends describing the origins of our solar system.\n\nThe Hidden Enemies Revealed on This World Stage\n\nBy Dr. Luke Prophet\n\nMany of you have read books by an author named Zecharia Sitchin. He wrote about the Anunnaki and their planet which he called Nibiru. Sitchin was a total fraud and a tool for the Vatican, but several of the Anunnaki characters in his books are also mentioned in the King James Bible namely Anu, Enki, Enlil, and Marduk. Some of you who have read Sitchin\u2019s books are waiting for the next arrival to earth of what they claim to be these benevolent extra-terrestrials. Nothing can be further from the truth.\n\nThe Anunnaki are not benevolent. They are extremely evil with the intention of causing mankind\u2019s extinction. They are not extra-terrestrial or inter-dimension but rather they are part of the host of heaven who rebelled when they found out the first creation of man, referred to as 144,000 saints (Revelation 7:4) or those created for honorable use (Romans 9:21) were to rule over them. For those people watching for Nibiru to come to earth with the Anunnaki, I have some news for you. The Anunnaki are already here on earth and have never left the earth. Earth is a prison colony. Psalm 83:3-5 is a dual prophecy that in our day is telling us to beware of those in leadership positions in all countries (See also Jude 1:4 and Jeremiah 10:11)\n\nI believe the Vatican wanted people to believe this lie to set people up for the alien deception as part of Project Bluebeam. After the Rapture occurs, the \u201cDevil and Satan\u201d will cause two delusions to fool the population. After the assassination of Trump and Pence and the Rapture, Trump and Pence will return in a spacecraft bringing with them many famous individuals who had previously died. The Anunnaki will claim to be the ones that created humankind. They will say that they have been responsible for those removed in the Rapture from earth as they would not have been willing to enter the next stage of man\u2019s development, namely becoming gods themselves through connecting the brain through Neuralink to the Internet. This concept of man becoming gods is called Gnosticism and is a great lie. One of the fallen Watchers, Gadreel according to the book of Enoch, deceived Eve in the garden by telling her if she listened to what he said, she would become like a god. (Genesis 3:4) As all evil is back on earth today, Gadreel is back trying to deceive humankind once again. In Jeremiah 10:11 the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob tells us the future of the Anunnaki.\n\nThus you shall say to them, \u201cThe gods that did not make the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth and from under the heavens.\u201d (Jeremiah 10:11)\n\nThe earth has a veil or firmament over it installed by the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. Nothing can enter the earth\u2019s atmosphere and nothing can escape. The Anunnaki are immortal. They do die like humans but unfortunately they always return through transmigration. The saints are also immortal through transmigration. Both the Anunnaki and the saints have always been with us, one group representing evil, and the other good.\n\nThat which has been is that which will be, And that which has been done is that which will be done. So, there is nothing new under the sun. (Ecclesiastes 1:9 NASB 77)\n\nWhat has been will be again, and what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun. (Ecclesiastes 1:9 The Berean Study Bible)\n\nUsing the gematria calculator on gematrix.org so you can follow along, I am matching the bible verse to the underlying meaning of the bible verse. We reduce the Gematria numbers to a single digit and if you get a match of three final numbers or witnesss of Holy Gematria, then we are confident that we have found a match.\n\nWhat has been will be again\n\n= 2174 or 74+21 or 95 or 9+5 = 14 or 7\n\n= 1206 or 10+20+6 = 36 or 6\n\n= 201 or 20+1 = 21 or 7\n\nThe Saints and Anunnaki transmigrate\n\n= 1372 or 72-13 = 59 or 5+9 = 14 or 7\n\n= 2184 or 2+1+8+4 = 15 or 1+5 = 6\n\n= 364 or 64-3 = 61 or 6+1 = 7\n\nThe Saints and Anunnaki have transmigrated to earth and are immortal so they come back in human form all the time.\n\nIn 1933 we almost had a fascist coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in America backed by bankers and wealthy businessmen led by J.P. Morgan against President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This coup was squelched by retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler. No one was arrested or jailed.\n\nThirty years later, in 1963 President John Kennedy was assassinated in another coup \u2019\u00e9tat orchestrated by rogue elements of the CIA and the Vatican with the main purpose of getting America deeply involved in the Vietnam civil war.\n\nIt is now fifty-seven years later and we are extremely close to experiencing another fascist coup \u2019\u00e9tat led by the same people as in 1963,namely the Bush family. The Bush families are Khazarian Zionists and George HW Bush and Menachem Schneerson were responsible for the introduction of the seven contrived Noahide laws passed by congress under the guise of \u201cEducation Day USA\u201d on March 20, 1991 which also happens to be Schneerson\u2019s birthday. I do not believe in coincidences. George HW Bush is not dead and is very much alive and living in Israel.\n\nPrior to the Second World War, it was decided that the Zionist Khazars (those who say they are Jews but are not, but are of the Synagogue of Satan Rev. 3:9) would be in charge of the New World Order with a one world global government under the United Nations; a one world digital currency controlled by the Rothschild\u2019s; and a one world Catholic Universal religion based on the Babylonian Talmud. Catholic means universal and it is a satanic religion as they worship Lucifer and idols. Enemies of this one world universal religion and fascist dictatorship will be the true Christian Israelites who follow Mosaic Law and do not adhere to the Talmud which Jeremiah 8:8 tells us was written by the lying pen of the Pharisee scribes. The true Israelite Christians base their faith on the word of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and not the interpretation of man. Catholics are not Christians as they follow man (a pope) rather than the word, and ordinances of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and the teachings of Jesus.\n\n/christian-news/2020/04/the-hidden-cabal-agenda-revealed-for-the-establishment-of-a-one-world-global-government-whose-sole-purpose-is-the-extinction-of-humankind-the-tribulation-timeline-the-antichrist-the-mark-of-t-2585323.html\n\nLinks To Previous Articles In This Series\n\nFlower Of Life Full Documentary Sacred Geometry And The 144,000 Bondservants Created As The Saints In Revelation 7.

Dave Bertrand, Ret. +Videos", "text": "By Capt. Dave Bertrand, Ret. \u201cWhat we have here\u2026.is a failure to communicate,\u201d a most famous movie line that we can all relate to as America falls to Communism\u2026.. It\u2019s incredible to imagine the critical point we have come to, where families, friends and neighbors are divided to the point of grave concern. And of course\u2026.it\u2019s all \u201cTrump\u2019s fault.\u201d Is it really?? From day one, when Trump and Melania walked down the stair case at Trump\u2019s New York hotel to announce his candidacy for president, the media were already one step ahead of him with everything they had while Obama and his cronies launched \u2018Spygate.\u2019 Insiders in the Clinton, Obama, FBI and CIA apparatus knew what was in-store for them if Trump was elected, therefore\u2026..all odds and propaganda was placed of Hillary, but BOOM ! Hillary was secretly overheard saying, \u201cIf that bastard is elected, we will all hang.\u201d So\u2026..where are the noose\u2019s Mr. president ?? Trump supporters have reached that point of concern whereas\u2026..a majority believe there will be no arrests for treason, and if the plan is to [carelessly] wait till after a Trump re-election, is like playing with a rattle snake and hoping it doesn\u2019t take a wack at you. ***Support BeforeItsNews By Trying HerbAnomic Natural Health Building Products Including Humic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex, Immusist Beverage Concentrate & UltraCur Bio-Available Curcumin! Click Here For More Information & To Order!*** Nancy Pelosi\u2026the witch-hag of the west, has made it very clear that Trump will be \u201cfumigated\u201d from the White House and \u201cfumigate\u201d means nothing survives [death]. Therefore\u2026..we have concluded, no matter if Trump wins by a landslide, there will be consequences, not only for Trump, but for the entire country. [WE] know that BLM and ANTIFA are mapping-out their plans for a major attack nationwide with destruction and mayhem in most every city in America, including plans to hit (what they believe to be) soft targets in rural America. What we are witnessing\u2026.much of it not reported by the media, is an onslaught of coordinated attacks across the country, i.e., over 100 Chicago Police ambushed by BLM / ANTIFA where 49 cops were injured. Portland mayor and the disgusting criminal, Governor Kate Brown, are absolutely beside themselves as a result of DHS sending officers into Portland to protect a federal building while BLM/ ANTIFA leaders were targeted and whisked away in white vans. Kate Brown was complicit in the ambush murder of rancher Lavoy Finicum by FBI and State Police, after a small group occupied an abandoned office at the Malheur Wildlife Reserve near Burns Oregon, calling the White House for federal help, but recently condemned federal intervention in Portland, taken-over by communist thugs. \u201cFederal authorities must move quickly to end the occupation and hold all of the wrongdoers accountable,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis spectacle of lawlessness must end.\u201d The occupation began Jan. 2 when a group of armed men led by Ammon and Ryan Bundy \u2014 the sons of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy \u2014 took over the refuge. Brown said she\u2019s been in touch with top officials at the U.S. Department of Justice and at the White House. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown On Burns: \u2018Spectacle Must End\u2019 Governor Kate Brown had no problem calling the Obama White House for help, [to kill] someone from the Bundy group on their way to another county to speak with cattle ranchers at the request by that county\u2019s Sheriff. The double standard and hypocrisy is beyond anything we have ever seen in-order to (1) destroy a sitting president and (2) the destruction of American life. The COVID-19 [Plandemic] is designed to force mail-in ballots\u2026.and there\u2019s plenty of evidence showing how corrupt the Dems are and how they will try to steal the November election. The other reason for faking the numbers to the point of massive fear, is to keep most Americans off the streets when the shooting war [Civil War II] begins around October and/or definitely after November 3rd. Today (July 2020) we are witnessing events surrounding COVID-19 and the systematic destruction of society at every level, hoping to make Trump look bad before the election, in-hopes the dumbed-down idiots on the Left are stupid enough to vote for Biden. But far more worse than stupid idiots voting for Biden, the possibility of Trump losing the election, because of disgruntled Trump supporters, gaining momentum, is a dangerous decision for America. Those having second thoughts about Trump are not necessarily going to vote for Communism, but will NOT vote! Patience is wearing thin as chaos in America continues to spin out-of-control, while [WE] have been assured that arrests will begin after Trump\u2019s re-election, might be a very delicate balancing act if Trump does not act soon. Hoping that millions of Dems (sitting on the fence) see what has become of their dangerous Democrat Party, watching their own cities burn down and occupied by Communist thugs, the idea [was] to allow it to happen in-order for Trump to say\u2026.\u201d see what they\u2019re doing, what do you have to lose, I\u2019m the law and order president?\u201d so vote for me??? Reality says\u2026..our beloved president might not be alive by November 3rd if Pelosi and her comrades get their CHANCE. Note: The last number known of attempts on Trump\u2019s life is 7, according to [Q]. President Trump is well protected by many military and Secret Service types, plus\u2026he made the right decision to take FDA approved hydroxychloroquine on a daily basis, a cheap drug that should be released to the public over-the-counter. But no\u2026..releasing hydroxychloroquine would devastate the plans by the Deep State and Dems to use the plandemic through Trump\u2019s re-election and into 2021, but would miraculously end on day one of a Biden presidency. Control of the population by using fake numbers while destroying society is not going to end anytime soon. The people that want their lives back and their businesses re-opened are mostly Trump supporters, and those playing along with the mask hoax (proven to be ineffective) are useful idiots that go out of their way to demonize and attack non-mask wearers. In the meanwhile\u2026\u2026\u201dpeaceful protests\u201d are ok and you are a \u201cRight Wing White Supremacist\u201d for counter demonstrating, especially if you don\u2019t follow the 6 foot rule without a mask. Trump supporters and Patriots alike have had enough and want Trump to act now, since the likelihood of his re-election (might) be in jeopardy. Militia groups are preparing, Sheriff departments in Red States are beginning to deputize legal gun owners, communities are preparing for a Black Lies Matter / ANTIFA attack, gun stores are overwhelmed with purchases, and others are fleeing to safe zones for what is coming soon. Trump has a Catch 22 problem in that\u2026..if he does nothing (much) and none of the top players, i.e., Comey, Brennan, Clapper, Hillary, et al are not arrested before a re-election, the Trump legacy (if not re-elected) will be doomed as nothing more than a Jimmy Carter term. President Trump is the only hope for maintaining Freedom and Liberty in a declining nation where Communism has a stronghold in most every American city. President Trump CANNOT hope for the treasonous criminals to be properly adjudicated in a federal court of law, but MUST treat their arrests in the same manner the Nuremberg trials were held. Military Tribunals in GITMO can ONLY be accomplished (effectively) if Trump invokes the \u2018Insurrection Act\u201d and declares nationwide Martial Law no later than September. If Trump does NOT act before (a) re-election, the American Patriots will have to act, because Communism is more than the plandemic\u2026.it\u2019s a cancer that has to be eradicated on the spot wherever it may be. \u2014Dave Bertrand #BlackLivesMatter a #Marxist Trained #Activist #Political Machine \u2013 Video CDC admits false positives are being \u201cmistakenly\u201d included in official coronavirus data By Ethan Huff / NewsTarget\n\nAll day every day, the mainstream media continues to hammer home fear about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which supposedly is \u201cspiking\u201d all around the country. But according to new evidence, there are so many false positives being \u201cmistakenly\u201d reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by health officials that nobody can really say for sure what is actually true.\n\nWhat we do know, at the very least, is that the number of new cases is drastically overinflated, not to mention that nobody in any position of authority can clarify what a \u201ccase\u201d actually entails. Does a \u201ccase\u201d mean a person is sick and showing symptoms, or does it merely mean that a person tested positive, with a possible false result?\n\nAs we saw in Florida, upwards of 100 percent of so-called \u201cpositive cases\u201d may actually be negative cases due to faulty testing protocols and mishandling of lab results. Consequently, the plandemic may not be anything close to what certain factions are claiming it is.\n\nBecause of this plethora of problems, the Trump administration has created new guidelines for testing that require all hospitals and testing centers to bypass the CDC entirely. Instead, Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) data will now go directly to a central database in Washington, D.C., where it will be handled by other entities.\n\nThere is also a prolific problem of positive antibody tests being lumped in with viral tests for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), which is seriously skewing our country\u2019s positivity rate.\n\n\u201cHealth officials from numerous states have mistakenly included positive results from antibody tests when reporting new COVID-19 cases to the CDC, grossly inflating new cases,\u201d wrote Fox News contributor and physician Nicole Saphier in a tweet. Doing this, she further explained, is the \u201cscientific equivalent to \u2018double-dipping.\u2019\u201d\n\nA positive antibody test for coronavirus typically only means that a person had a cold at one point in time\n\nThe problem with the antibody test specifically is that a positive result is practically meaningless, as all it shows is that a person at one point in time was infected with a virus from the same coronavirus family that causes the common cold. In other words, it is a false alarm and bad science, though this is what the lockdown-pushing, mask-promoting Left considers to be the \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration says that inside sources have confirmed that the CDC is actively fudging the numbers, either by double-dipping or by reporting false positives. In some cases, people who are not even being tested are somehow receiving positive test results for tests they never took.\n\nEvidence has also emerged to suggest that the CDC, at one point, was taking up to seven weeks to compile data and statistics on the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), and only under pressure started to report them all at once with a multi-week lag. This would explain the sudden \u201csurge\u201d that the mainstream media claims is taking place, but that the vast majority of everyday folks are unable to discern or observe anywhere around them in real life.\n\n\u201cSo HHS took over data reporting from CDC,\u201d tweeted Emerald Robinson, who broke the news about the CDC\u2019s deception. \u201cHHS is able to compile & report this data daily.\u201d\n\nRobinson further claims that she is getting flooded with messages from folks who claim that they signed up for a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) test, went to a testing site, but left early because of long lines. These same people were later notified, simply because their information from the sign-up went into a database that they had \u201ctested positive.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite not taking the test, they get notified later that they\u2019ve tested positive,\u201d she further tweeted, citing examples in Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, among others.\n\nThe latest Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) news is available for your reading pleasure at Pandemic.news.\n\nSources for this article include:\n\nTheGatewayPundit.com\n\nNaturalNews.com", "link": "https://beforeitsnews.com/opinion-conservative/2020/07/black-lies-matter-marxists-planning-full-scale-attack-nationwide-trump-must-act-now-or-his-legacy-will-be-failure-patriots-getting-prepared-capt-dave-bertrand-ret-videos-3534247.html", "author": ["John Rolls"]}, {"title": "Big Pharma, Human Prey: The Real Story Behind Blood Donations - Video Documentary", "text": "\n\n\n\nWhether billed as a community drive, corporate drive, team drive or emergency drive, the American public has long been called upon to donate their blood to help others in need.\n\n\u201cGiving blood is a simple thing to do, but it can make a big difference in the lives of others.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery whole blood donation has the power to save up to 3 lives. Your donation could be someone\u2019s only chance at another day.\u201d\n\nThe catch phrases vary, and freely donating blood is indeed a positive action. But there is a darker side to the business of blood donation.\n\nThis video documentary, \u201cBlood Business\u201d, sheds light on the opaque trade of the blood plasma industry. From the impoverished streets of Cleveland, Ohio, to the golden shores of Switzerland\u2019s Lake Zurich, the film explores the intricacies around the business of blood, and the price being paid by the humans involved.\n\nPlasma, a component of blood which is highly sought-after, now costs more per liter than petrol. Used by pharmaceutical companies to create expensive medications, this precious liquid has become a lucrative commodity. This film investigates one of the largest corporations in this flourishing market, with profits soaring over \u20ac1 billion (US$1.13 billion). Their donation centers are mostly found in poor neighborhoods in the United States, and they pay donors for their blood \u2013 a practice forbidden in Europe.\n\nFor impoverished Americans, blood donations have become a source of income, presenting a real risk to their health, as they lie about their conditions and donate repeatedly to make ends meet. There are donors who give blood in the hope of helping others, but the reality of where their blood donations actually go can be somewhat different. This video documentary investigates the global trade in blood and plasma donations.\n\nAn interesting side effect (there are so many unintended consequences) of the coronavirus spread and subsequent lockdown across the country and around the world is a dire shortage of available blood. When nonessential businesses were mandated to close, blood drives everywhere were canceled, and orders of social distancing resulted in many people being afraid to go into established donation centers. Turns out the donation of blood was listed as an essential service on local health department lists, but they forgot to tell the public.\n\nChris Hrouda, president of biomedical services for the American Red Cross, which collects about 40 percent of the country\u2019s blood donations, calls it a \u201cstaggering\u201d drop in supply. \u201cOur inventories have been cut in half,\u201d Mr. Hrouda said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get into a critical situation.\u201d\n\nFrom the New York Times, 17 June 2020\n\nOn a hstorical note, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Grifols Lucas, a scientist from Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain, founded Laboratorios Grifols in 1940. There, he pioneered a first-of-its-kind technique called plasmapheresis, where a donor\u2019s red blood cells would be returned to the donor\u2019s body almost immediately after the separation of the blood plasma. This technique is still in practice today, eighty years later.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) maintains the Model List of Essential Medicines which lists the most important medications needed in a basic health system. Fresh frozen plasma is on this list, considered critically important for\n\ntreatment of many types of trauma resulting in blood loss. It is kept stocked universally in all medical facilities capable of treating trauma cases.\n\nSo, what is blood plasma, this \u2018golden\u2019 elixir of life worth so very much to the medical industry?. The following is from Wikipedia\u2026\n\n\u201cBlood plasma is a \u2018yellowish liquid\u2019 component of blood that holds the blood cells of whole blood in suspension. It is the liquid part of the blood that carries cells and proteins throughout the body. It makes up about 55% of the body\u2019s total blood volume. It is the intravascular fluid part of extracellular fluid (all body fluid outside cells). It is mostly water (up to 95% by volume), and contains important dissolved proteins (6\u20138%) (e.g., serum albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen), glucose, clotting factors, electrolytes (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3\u2212, Cl\u2212, etc.), hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and oxygen. It plays a vital role in an intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolyte concentration balanced and protects the body from infection and other blood disorders.\u201d\n\nReferences", "link": "https://beforeitsnews.com/health/2020/07/big-pharma-human-prey-the-real-story-behind-blood-donations-video-documentary-3032785.html", "author": []}, {"title": "Jim Willie - Emergency Economic Meeting 1-3 - Will COMEX Force Majeure Kill The Dollar Overnight?", "text": "% of readers think this story is Fact.

The answer is NO \u2013 RF will not come back into the house. The reason is that the utility box itself is made of metal which blocks RF. The glass part of the smart meter is where the RF radiation emanates from. Unfortunately, the RF transmits outwardly in ALL directions \u2013 anywhere inside the house that has line of site to the glass portion of the smart meter will be subject to RF exposure. But, once the Smart Meter Cover is installed, the cover combined with the back of the metal utility box forms a cage that contains the RF. Once the Smart Meter Cover is in place the high frequency radiation cannot escape and ~98% of the RF energy is reduced.\n\nHow do I know if the EMF Blocking Smart Meter Cover is working?\n\nOccasionally a customer will write to say that the meter is not effective \u2013 so far, every time this has happened, it is because the customer happens to be measuring the wrong type of EMF.\n\nThere are THREE main types of electromagnetic fields (EMFs).

Soros-paid-for prosecutor Kim Gardner has decided to ignore the state\u2019s laws and bring charges against the couple who legally defended their lives and their property form a violent mob who broke down their gate a few weeks ago.\n\nMark and Patricia McCloskey grabbed their weapons and faced off with illegal rioters\u2026 but Gardner has confiscated their guns (thanks to \u2018red flag\u2019 law idiocy) and has now brought charges against them.\n\nNo charged have been filed against the \u2018protestors\u2019 who broke into the property and shouted threats, holding \u201cmachine gun\u201d mics in their faces, which incidentally, look a lot like a weapon.\n\nIn fact, many people argue that the McCloskey\u2019s are a great example of responsible gun ownership. No one was shot or injured, and their home and family remained safe.\n\nHowever, experts argue that these Soros backed prosecutors are out to actually destroy the law and the justice system, creating chaos. And given Gardner\u2019s actions, there seems to be a case for that argument.\n\nHowever, Missouri has an Attorney General who is not bought and paid for by leftist agitators, and he has \u201centered\u201d the case to arrange a dismissal.\n\nKCTV 5 reported:\n\nSt. Louis Police Chief John Hayden last week said police applied for warrants but did not elaborate on what those warrants allege or who they are against. The guns were turned over to police as evidence.\n\n\u201cThe hostility is what I noticed,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see guns out when people are very hostile and angry at each other. Those are recipes for violence, so again we applied on warrant, there\u2019s been follow up information and we are waiting on the decision on the warrant application.\u201d\n\n[Hostility on who\u2019s side?\u2026 and is it against the law to show hostility? If that\u2019s the case, the \u2018protestors\u2019 should have ALL been arrested.]\n\nThe McCloskeys appeared on President Trump\u2019s virtual campaign web series Friday night.\n\nThe couple shared their side of what happened during the President\u2019s campaign livestream.\n\n\u201cI thought within seconds we were going to be overrun. That\u2026 they\u2019d be in the house, they\u2019d be setting fires, they\u2019d be killing us and that would be the end of things,\u201d Mark McCloskey said on Trump\u2019s campaign program Making the Case.\n\n\u201cThe so-called peaceful protest kinda ended when they smashed through the gate into my neighborhood and poured into my front yard,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u2026\n\nPatricia McCloskey maintained they called police before grabbing the guns despite police stating they received no calls from the couple\u2019s street at the time of the incident.\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson told a radio host last week that based on the information he\u2019s received, it\u2019s likely he would pardon a white St. Louis couple if they are charged for brandishing guns during a racial injustice protest outside their mansion.\n\nIn an interview Friday on the Marc Cox Morning Show on 97.1 FM in St. Louis, Parson was asked if he would consider a pardon.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s exactly what would happen,\u201d Parson said. He later added that based on what he knows about the case, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to spend any time in jail.\u201d\n\nParson on Saturday retweeted a link to the interview on his personal Twitter page. The following day, the governor doubled down on his stance in a string of tweets.\n\n\u201cAs a former Sheriff, a law enforcement officer for over 22 years, and now Governor, when it comes to supporting law enforcement officers and their families who are under attack, I\u2019ll always stand with President Trump and have their backs,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nParson had previously said President Trump was keeping his eye on the case.\n\nThe Epoch Times reported:\n\nAttorney General Eric Schmitt late Monday filed a brief seeking to dismiss charges filed against Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who wielded their guns as a crowd moved past their property last month.\n\nThe brief filing cites the Second Amendment and says that \u201cthe Attorney General respectfully requests that the Court dismiss this case at the earliest possible opportunity.\u201d\n\nSchmitt\u2019s filing to dismiss charges comes just hours after the Circuit Attorney\u2019s Office filed charges against the couple, which include felony charges of unlawful use of a weapon and a misdemeanor charge of fourth-degree assault.\n\nThe McCloskeys had stepped outside their mansion on June 28 and wielded their guns after a group of activists entered their private neighborhood.\n\nGardner, a Democrat, said in a statement on Monday that it is \u201cillegal to wave weapons in a threatening manner at those participating in nonviolent protest.\u201d\n\nThe McCloskeys\u2019 lawyer, Joel Schwartz, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the charges were \u201cdisheartening as I unequivocally believe no crime was committed.\u201d\n\nIn a prepared statement late Monday, Schmitt reiterated the Second Amendment rights of Missourians.\n\n\u201cThe right to keep and bear arms is given the highest level of protection in our constitution and our laws, including the Castle Doctrine. This provides broad rights to Missourians who are protecting their property and lives from those who wish to do them harm,\u201d Schmitt said.\n\n\u201cDespite this, Circuit Attorney Gardner filed charges against the McCloskeys, who, according to published reports, were defending their property and safety. As Missouri\u2019s Chief law enforcement officer, I won\u2019t stand by while Missouri law is being ignored\u2014that\u2019s why I entered this case to seek its dismissal, to protect the rights of Missourians to defend their property under Missouri\u2019s Castle Doctrine.\u201d\n\nSchmitt reiterated his message on Twitter in a video, where he added an accompanying statement saying, \u201cCitizens shouldn\u2019t be targeted for exercising their [Second Amendment] right to self-defense.\u201d\n\nCitizens shouldn\u2019t be targeted for exercising their #2A right to self-defense\n\nSTL prosecutor Kim Gardner is engaged in a political prosecution\n\nAs AG I\u2019m entering the case seeking a dismissal & defend all Missourians\u2019 right to protect their lives/property pic.twitter.com/kQLXOAhFIz\n\n\u2014 Eric Schmitt (@Eric_Schmitt) July 20, 2020\n\nMissouri\u2019s statue, officially titled \u201cUse of force in defense of persons\u201d and typically referred to as the castle doctrine, permits people to employ deadly force if people enter their homes without consent.\n\nIt also says that a person doesn\u2019t \u201chave a duty to retreat from a dwelling, residence, or vehicle where the person is not unlawfully entering or unlawfully remaining\u201d and \u201cfrom private property that is owned or leased by such individual.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Missouri Law Review of property law (pdf), gated communities have been affirmed in courts as being able to bar entry to non-residents who don\u2019t receive invitations to enter.\n\nJohn Ammann, a professor of justice at Saint Louis University\u2019s School of Law, had earlier told The Epoch Times that the couple shouldn\u2019t have aimed their guns at the group.\n\n\u201cIn Missouri, they can do open carry, so maybe holding the guns at their side was OK. But not aiming them,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nIn the video footage captured last month, the McCloskeys were seen outside their property holding up guns while telling protesters to leave the area. The couple, who are both lawyers, said they were in fear for their lives at the time.\n\nMark McCloskey later told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, \u201cI believe in my heart of hearts that the only thing that kept those mobsters, that crowd, away from us is that we were standing there with guns.\u201d\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, last week told a St. Louis radio station that he will likely pardon the couple if they are convicted.\n\nParson told the station that the McCloskeys \u201cdid what they legally should do,\u201d reported The Hill. \u201cA mob does not have the right to charge your property,\u201d he said, according to the paper. \u201cThey had every right to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nWeren't these folks on their own private property?

Brian Kemp has filed a lawsuit against Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and members of the city council for imposing a mask mandate and other pandemic restrictions.\n\nIn addition to challenging a mask requirement, the suit pushes back against the Atlanta Mayor\u2019s move to backtrack to \u201cphase one\u201d guidelines, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, some of the requests in the governor\u2019s suit are that the judge overturn any of the mayor\u2019s orders that impose stiffer restrictions than the governor has instituted and that the judge prohibit the mayor from putting out any new orders with stiffer restrictions than those of the governor.\n\n\u201cGovernor Kemp must be allowed, as the chief executive of this state, to manage the public health emergency without Mayor Bottoms issuing void and unenforceable orders which only serve to confuse the public,\u201d the lawsuit states according to the AP.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit is on behalf of the Atlanta business owners and their hardworking employees who are struggling to survive during these difficult times,\u201d Gov. Kemp said in a Twitter statement. \u201cThese men and women are doing their very best to put food on the table for their families while local elected officials shutter businesses and undermine economic growth.\u201d\n\nMayor Bottoms spoke out about the governor\u2019s move.\n\n\u201c3104 Georgians have died and I and my family are amongst the 106k who have tested positive for COVID-19. Meanwhile, I have been sued by @GovKemp for a mask mandate.

There is NO SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE showing that masks do anything to stop the spread of this Chinese virus.\n\nBreitbart News reported:\n\nGeorgia Gov.

However, he is \u201cstrongly\u201d encouraging Georgians to wear masks in public.\n\n\u201cKemp\u2019s new order also bans local governments from requiring masks on public property, which void requirements that some governments have imposed for citizens to wear masks inside city and county buildings,\u201d according to the Associated Press.\n\n\u201cIt is officially official. Governor Kemp does not give a damn about us. Every man and woman for himself/herself.

But it could serve as a template for continuing resolutions that keep the government running, and the statue-removal provision could make its way into that legislation.\n\n\u201cThe bill includes language directing the Architect of the Capitol to remove statues or busts in the U.S. Capitol that represent figures who participated in the Confederate Army or government, as well as the statues of individuals with unambiguous records of racial intolerance, Charles Aycock, John C. Calhoun, and James Paul Clarke, and the bust of Roger B.

Davis commanded Mississippi\u2019s military forces after it seceded from the union and later was the president of the Confederacy.\n\n[President] Trump has explicitly defended statues of nearly universally venerated American Founders who owned slaves, like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, and who have come under fire by some on the far left. This includes more controversial figures who nonetheless played a significant part in American history, like Andrew Jackson and Christopher Columbus, and longstanding military tributes to Confederates like Fort Bragg and Fort Lee.\n\n[President] Trump has been less explicit on defending Confederate displays in other cases, and it\u2019s not clear Trump would oppose the specific provisions in the House bill. Trump did, however, defend monuments that \u201crepresent our History & Heritage, both\u2026 the good and the bad\u201d in a tweet thread last month, implying he would support leaving up Confederate monuments that some protesters have torn down amid recent racial unrest.\n\nThe president last week issued an executive order providing for a national statue garden that would include a number of American founders, some who owned slaves, along with civil rights leaders like Harriet Tubman, Martin Luther King, Jr., Frederick Douglass and Jackie Robinson.\n\nBut Trump on Monday sent a controversial tweet that argued the decision by NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag contributed to its \u201clowest ratings EVER!\u201d which is not true \u2014 the TV ratings for the sport have increased since it banned the flag.\n\nCongress has made other efforts to purge Confederate tributes as well. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., removed the portraits of former House speakers who served the Confederacy last month and the Republican-controlled Senate included a provision in a defense bill that would rename military assets \u2014 including Fort Bragg and Fort Lee \u2014 that are named after Confederates, prompting a veto threat from Trump.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/dems-use-funding-bill-to-sneak-in-confederate-statue-removal-provision/", "author": []}, {"title": "Democrats Defect!

Let\u2019s see how they add up.\n\nTweet Number One:\n\nNancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally & has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the \u201clefties\u201d in her party that she has lost control\u2026And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting! \u2014 Donald J.

She is so petrified of the \u201clefties\u201d in her party that she has lost control\u2026And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!\u201d\n\nAs far as Pelosi\u2019s irrational behavior, during a speech blasting the tax reform bill, Pelosi made the claim that, the bill gave \u201ctax breaks to the wealthiest people in our country,\u201d and that \u201cPresident Trump promised a tax reform focused on the middle class families. Republicans wrote a tax scam that raises taxes on 86 million middle class families in our country.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the numbers, the president is correct and those claims are pretty irrational.\n\nIn August, 2018, Investor\u2019s Business Daily reported, \u201canalysis from Congress\u2019 Joint Economic Committee (JEC) shows that the benefits of making the cuts permanent would mostly go to low- and middle-income earners.\u201d\n\nThe JEC found:\n\n\u201cTaxpayers with incomes under $50,000 will see their share of the total federal tax burden drop from 4.2% to 3.9%.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose with less than $10,000 in income will see their taxes slashed by more than half.\u201d\n\n\u201cAverage taxpayers with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000, a group that frequently claims refundable tax credits, will have no tax liability and receive an additional refund.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillionaires will actually see their share of the total federal tax burden rise to 20.2%, compare to 19.6% if tax relief expires.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile taxpayers will enjoy an average 5.2% cut in their taxes, taxpayers that earn over $1 million will see a below-average reduction of 2.3%.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks to TCJA (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), 90% of wage earners are seeing higher take-home pay,\u201d Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, wrote in The Hill. \u201cA family of four earning the median annual income $73,000 per year will see a 58% reduction in federal taxes, while a single parent with one child earning $41,000 will see a 73% reduction in federal taxes.\u201d\n\nMost people agree that the definition of a \u201cradical Democrat\u201d would be a person who opposes such benefits to the economy and the working class.\n\nTrump also claimed Pelosi is so \u201cpetrified of the \u2018lefties\u2019 in her party that she has lost control.\u201d\n\nThat statement could be argued as opinion, but given her dismissal of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win as \u201cone district,\u201d and the fact that the freshman lawmaker staged a protest a Pelosi\u2019s office, this statement isn\u2019t that far-fetched.\n\n.\u2066@Ocasio2018\u2069 kicks off first day of freshmen orientation with a protest \u2066@NancyPelosi\u2069\u2019s office. pic.twitter.com/KBVjLvHVPU \u2014 Nicole Gaudiano (@ngaudiano) November 13, 2018\n\nIn the same tweet, the president blasted the squalid filth of San Francisco, and adjured Pelosi to clean it up. The feces, needles, and general fetid conditions found in Nancy Pelosi\u2019s district has become notorious.\n\nTweet Number Two and Three:\n\nDon\u2019t forget, we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now.

They should do the right thing for the Country & allow people to go back to work.\u201d\n\nIn both of these tweets, the president has stated the facts.\n\nThe president has been building sections of the wall, but the mainstream media is loath to report on it. The El Paso Times recently reported, \u201cConstruction of the border wall in the Chihuahuita neighborhood of Downtown El Paso continued Wednesday beneath the Stanton Street International Bridge. The U.S. Border Patrol announced Friday that the new wall would replace existing fencing south of Downtown El Paso and that construction would begin Saturday as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order authorizing construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall.\u201d\n\nLikewise, another $145 million (a very small price tag) has been paid to a contractor to begin construction of \u201csix miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said Friday that SLSCO will begin construction of an 18-foot reinforced concrete levee wall in February in the agency\u2019s McAllen Station region. The company will also increase the height of existing fences. It will be the first section of President Trump\u2019s border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings.\u201d\n\nTweet Number Four:\n\nWow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%.

However, they forgot to add that \u201cIn early December, the poll had Trump\u2019s approval rating among Latino adults at 31%. The results from the poll released Thursday show the president\u2019s job approval among Latino adults at 50%.\u201d\n\nTweet Number Five:\n\nAlways heard that as President, \u201cit\u2019s all about the economy!\u201d Well, we have one of the best economies in the history of our Country.

How good is that? It\u2019s the fastest spurt of growth in three years. Even a pair of devastating hurricanes, Maria and Harvey, did little to slow the economy down.\u201d\n\nRegarding unemployment, this summer CNN was forced to acknowledge that the new rate \u201ctied the lowest unemployment rate since 1969.\u201d And, \u201cOver the past year, the unemployment rate among 16- to 19-year-olds has fallen from 14.1% to 12.8%.\u201d\n\nMoreover, at least seven companies have \u2018reinvested in America,\u201d and \u201c16 companies announced the largest reshoring initiatives plan to bring back, add, or retain a combined total of approximately 73,000 manufacturing jobs\u201d to the United States.\n\nIn November, the president signed the \u201cUnited States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will replace the outdated, failed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\u201d And countless other actions have been taken to boost the economy and remove the unfair trade that has characterized U.S. relationships for scores of years.\n\nIt appears that the president\u2019s tweets aren\u2019t just idle boasts.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/fact-checking-the-top-5-trump-tweets-over-the-last-few-days/", "author": []}, {"title": "Colorado GOP Primary Stuns!

Calls On Justice Dept. To Ground All \u201cTrojan\u201d Chinese Drones Monitoring Citizens", "text": "Last week, reports showed that many cities were using Chinese-made drones to monitor citizens\u2019 activity, and ensure that \u2018social distancing\u2019 orders were observed. Of course, the drones (discovered in 2017) are able to provide that information to \u201cterrorist organizations,\u201d infuriating a number of people, including Rep. Matt Gaetz.\n\nThe GOP Rep. called on the Justice Department and William Barr to order an immediate grounding of all such drones.\n\nJust the News reported:\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) is calling on Attorney General William Barr to order the grounding of all China-connected DJI drones used by law enforcement across the U.S. \u2013 including state and local agencies.\n\nDJI (D\u00e0-Ji\u0101ng Innovations) is a Chinese technology company that is suspected of using information from the drones used by U.S. law enforcement to feed sensitive data back to the Chinese government.\n\nIn 2017, the Department of Homeland Security released a report, in which they determined that DJI had specifically marketed their product to local law enforcement agencies, and as a result, China is able to \u201cprovide DJI information to terrorist organizations \u2026 to coordinate attacks against U.S. critical infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe findings of DHS\u2019s report prompted the U.S. Army and the Department of the Interior to end their use of DJI drones. However, law enforcement agencies across the country continue to use them, and several dozen local agencies recently accepted a donation of the drones from DJI, despite the national security risk they pose.\n\nOn a Fox News \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d appearance, Gaetz spoke about his letter sent Monday to Barr and called the DJI drones a \u201cTrojan horse spying operation in our country\u201d that local police departments may unwittingly be helping.\n\nWatch the Interview below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CmhHKvmyma4", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/gop-rep-calls-on-justice-dept-to-ground-all-trojan-chinese-drones-monitoring-citizens/", "author": []}, {"title": "GOP Governor Forced To Defend Adherence To U.S. Constitution", "text": "In what seems bizarre to many people, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem has been forced to defend her decision to adhere to the Constitution of the United States, rather than bow to media hysteria and revoke the inalienable rights granted by God to the citizens of her state.\n\nIn fact, many people argue that if these rights are not inviolate, and can be revoked at any time for a health \u2018crisis,\u2019 then the rights do not exist in the first place.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported:\n\nRepublican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem is one of a few state governors who have not yet placed citizens under a stay-at-home order in response to the current outbreak.\n\nNot only has she not placed the order, she has been outspoken in her contention that doing so would stand against everything America is supposed to stand for. She sees her decision as empowering individuals to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their families.\n\nShe is also taking an aggressive position on the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating the virus, placing her ahead of many other state governors.\n\nAs a result, on Monday, Governor Noem received about the highest praise any good American could when she was attacked in the pages of the Washington Post.\n\nThe Post used the occasion of an outbreak of the virus at South Dakota\u2019s Smithfield Foods, a pork producer located in Sioux Falls, as an opportunity to attack the governor\u2019s non-conformance. More than 300 workers at the facility have now tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus.\n\nFor anyone just learning of the story, that might give you pause to think that the governor should have locked down the state after all.\n\nThere are two problems with that conclusion. The first being South Dakota, a very rural state, has fewer than 1,000 reported cases of the virus (10th lowest in the nation), meaning the outbreak at Smithfield Foods accounts for nearly one-third of all statewide cases. The other problem, as was pointed out in The Federalist, is that since the pork plant is an \u201cessential industry,\u201d the workers would have been there even with a lockdown!\n\nOf the 988 cases reported in South Dakota as of this wiring, nearly 800 are reported in the county where the plant is located. This makes the South Dakota experience with the virus one of the most localized and minimized in the entire country. This is despite the fact that while much of the nation has been locked down for at least three weeks, South Dakota has remained open.\n\nGovernor Noem has been standing firm against the mob and their chosen talking heads on mainstream and social media, that have been demanding obedience to the collective \u201cwisdom\u201d of the collectivists, the \u201celites\u201d and the \u201cexperts.\u201d In a time when big government has taken control of almost everything (from fishing rights, to buying garden seeds, to traveling to a relative\u2019s home) in most places, Governor Noem has courageously looked the mob in the eye and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t like to hear \u201cno.\u201d They aren\u2019t used to hearing \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOne of the principal differences between Republicans and Democrats is supposed to be that Democrats favor government intervention in nearly every aspect of our lives, while Republicans almost universally say they prefer limited government and individual rights. They say that, but these past few weeks prove that only a few of them mean it.\n\nGovernor Noem means it and she isn\u2019t apologizing for it.\n\nThere is an important distinction to be made in my support of the governor over her refusals to lock down the state. I am not suggesting that no leader should have ordered any lockdown, for any period of time, anywhere in the country. What I am suggesting is that in the particular case of South Dakota there was and is no reason to order a lockdown.\n\nIf Governor Noem had caved in to the pressure of the national digital mob it would have been strictly for the purpose of saving face \u2014 for being liked. She could have done it to try and avoid criticism. To that point, I\u2019m sure the governor knows that you can\u2019t satisfy the insatiable. Most politicians, especially Republicans, cower when the media puts them in their crosshairs. Governor Noem is showing no such signs of cowardice. She is, seemingly, the rarest of all things in American politics \u2014 the real deal.\n\nI\u2019m sure the governor isn\u2019t doing any of this to receive national recognition, but thanks to the Washington Post and others, she\u2019s getting it anyway. What they undoubtedly intended as a hit piece, will be perceived by at least half of the country as a badge of honor. In fact, when her time as governor is concluded, should she give serious consideration to seeking higher office, I believe she would be rewarded for her bravery and dedication to the Constitution. I for one hope she does consider it.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported:\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News, Noem defended her decisions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got one issue in a pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, but outside of that, two-thirds of our state has no cases or one case in an entire county. So we are doing very well as a state,\u201d Noem explained. \u201cWe are addressing the one hot spot that we do have and aggressively testing in that area, but what you talked about Laura is exactly right.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWe should be tracking who\u2019s in the hospital, what the death rate is, and South Dakotans are doing a fantastic job following my recommendations, and we\u2019ve been able to keep our businesses open and allow people to take on some personal responsibility.\u201d\n\nNoem addressed the outbreak at Smithfield Foods, a pork processing plant that was closed after an outbreak infected more than 200 employees. While many have blamed Noem\u2019s refusal to close the state for the outbreak, the governor noted that Smithfield would have been open either way because it is a vital part of the food chain that is responsible for 5% of the nation\u2019s pork supply.\n\n\u201cThis processing plant is critical infrastructure,\u201d Noem explained. \u201cRegardless of a shelter-in-place order or not, it would have been up and running because it\u2019s an important part of our nation\u2019s food supply. So that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening on the national level is they\u2019ve been not telling all the facts behind this. The people of South Dakota can be trusted to make good decisions. We have common sense.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThat\u2019s why people want to live here, and that\u2019s why I love living here.\u201d\n\nNoem noted that she does not believe it would be constitutional for her to close down the state. She explained, \u201cI took an oath when I was in Congress, obviously to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I believe in our freedoms and liberties.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen across the country is so many people give up their liberties for just a little bit of security. And they don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Noem said. \u201cIf a leader will take too much power in a time of crisis, that is how we lose our country. So I felt like I\u2019ve had to use every single opportunity to talk about why we slow things down. We make decisions based on science and facts and make sure that we are not letting emotion grab a hold of the situation.\u201d\n\nWell said, ma\u2019am.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/gop-governor-forced-to-defend-adherence-to-u-s-constitution/", "author": []}, {"title": "Ron Paul Makes Stock Market Predictions, Unavoidable Despite Denying Tariffs", "text": "During the lead up to the 2016 election, before traction was gained by much of anyone except Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY), the idea of sound money was on the lips of the GOP, at least at a grassroots level. Once Donald Trump\u2019s popularity rose, while he embraced a great many libertarian precepts, his stance on money is one that relies on a FIAT system that is going to destroy our economy no matter who is in office. Addressing this truth is long time libertarian icon, retired Texas legend, Ron Paul.\n\nPaul is the hero who may well be president even today (if he had won a second term) if he had not been cheated by his own party in 2012 (much like Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was during the last cycle by his party). He has, in the past, warned that some within the government may wish to kill Mr. Trump. Now Paul is now sounding a different bell again. According to CNBC, he says that the stock market is not in danger only due to \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threat.\u201d He warns that \u201cthis is going to be a calamity\u201d and the system has been \u201crigged.\u201d\n\nHere, we see that even Paul can be missing some of Trump\u2019s skill, though not in total. Protecting U.S. jobs is something that has to happen and these tariffs are very needed. However, to do so sans the gold standard is a death sentence, something that the retired Texan has long admitted.\n\nAs correctly as ever, Ron Paul said that our real problem \u201cstems from Federal Reserve policy and easy money,\u201d a fact that becomes clearer and clearer each year.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed continues on the things that they are sort of planning on doing, it\u2019s going to be a calamity,\u201d Paul warned on the show, Trading Nation. \u201cI think we have a greater distortion and a financial danger sitting out there bigger than ever before.\u201d\n\nForgetting that (while Mr. Trump is by far and away the best thing to happen to America in a generation) the president is wrong in many ways about FIAT currency is easy to do. However, the jubilance will fade when the economic prophecies of Ron Paul prove true, so it would be wise to address these concerns early on.\n\nThe Fed has made \u201ccritical errors\u201d and has \u201crigged the economy,\u201d the former Congressman warns. These woes \u201crange from keeping interest rates low for too long, the rounds of quantitative easing and timing of selling its financial-crisis era assets.\u201d Each problem listed in a guillotine blade looms over the heads of investors, and by proxy, the entire nation.\n\nThe ever-blooming budget deficit is also a problem that is not being addressed, according to Ron Paul. His son has also voiced the same concerns on a great number of occasions.\n\nThe elder Paul lamented, \u201cEverything is just very burdened with debt, and there\u2019s no stopping it.\u201d He says investors should in no way be shocked if the stock market loses 50% of it\u2019s worth, even.\n\nShowing how former President Obama and his bailouts only made things much worse, he also stated, \u201cThe correction is going to be huge, and I don\u2019t think anybody can predict.

This time, while everything happened out of cameras and through the comfortable effectiveness of his spokesman, Sanders showed once again that transparency is not exactly his most favorite word.\n\nBasically, he canceled an interview just because he didn\u2019t get to control the questions. Specifically, he couldn\u2019t control those regarding his family and his wife, who is facing a major scandal that the Vermont senator called a \u201cgossip.\u201d Lamentably for him, new reports informed there would be indictments on this matter.\n\nAccording to a Vermont-based paper, the socialist backed out of the interview after the news outlet announced that he couldn\u2019t make his family wife\u2019s controversy off-limit. Naturally, while Sanders had no problem in having the interview, this was an extremely important condition.\n\nAfter all, while he always loved to provide the image of an irreverent figure that doesn\u2019t comply with the bourgeoisie manners of the U.S. politics, Sanders proved to be worse than the kind of politicians he always despised.\n\nWhile his wife has been swimming in really hot water for several months, Sanders is not only using his influence to let her get away with murder, but also refusing to say anything regarding this problem.\n\nNaturally, while it\u2019s always quite ugly to see a politician canceling an interview because of these kinds of issues, it\u2019s always worse when the one who does it tends to glorify himself as someone who is above these political banalities.\n\nApparently, his spokesman Daniel McLean called the news outlet Seven Days on Sunday in order to offer the interview with the senator on Monday morning. At this point, it all seemed like the interview was almost good to go.\n\nHowever, things started to get ugly when the spokesman said the paper would not be allowed to ask anything related to his family, or what he described as \u201cpolitical gossip.\u201d Basically, it was like having the opportunity to interview George W. Bush and not being able to ask him about Iraq.\n\nLogically, the newspaper refused to accept this particular condition, considering that by accepting it they would be forced conduct just a shameful interview. In fact, the news outlet even noted that it has never accepted any kind of preconditions to political interviews.\n\nSoon after that, there was a particular moment when one reporter of this newspaper decided to confront the senator in person to ask for an interview. Believe it or not, Sanders made it perfectly clear that he would only accept an interview only if the newspaper accepted his terms.\n\n\u201cWell, as I think Dan indicated, we talk about issues. We don\u2019t talk about gossip,\u201d the senator said. Naturally, he tried to make the idea that his wife\u2019s controversy is nothing more than an irrelevant topic.\n\nAccording to The Washington Free Beacon, the alternative newspaper pointed out that Bernie Sanders\u2019 stepdaughter Carina Driscoll is now running for mayor of Burlington. In addition, it said that the senator\u2019s wife Jane Sanders has been under heavy scrutiny by federal investigators.\n\nAs everyone knows, Jane Sanders has been investigated for her infamous role in possible bank fraud. Apparently, this controversial case is connected to a land purchase she made while she was the president of the now-defunct Burlington College.\n\nEarlier this month, VTDigger reported that the investigation had expanded to a grand jury. In addition, this media outlet pointed out that there could be upcoming indictments to the senator\u2019s wife.\n\nNaturally, Bernie Sanders is making a lot of efforts in avoiding any kind of question regarding this controversy, considering the huge damage it could make on his political ambitions. Especially when there\u2019s a presidential election in just two years.\n\nAccording to several reports, the Vermont senator could be once again one of the main candidates in the Democratic primaries in order to compete against President Donald Trump for turning the White House liberal again.\n\nWhile the Democratic Party hasn\u2019t provided any kind of comment regarding the presidential elections, almost every single analyst agree that Bernie Sanders could be the favorite to winning the primaries.\n\nBasically, there are two significant factors that are quite important to understand why this socialist could be the Democratic nominee in 2020.\n\nOn one hand, it is an undeniable fact that he remains as the most popular figure on the Democratic party since Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in the 2016 presidential election against Donald Trump. In fact, almost every single poll confirms it.\n\nOn the other hand, he could easily exploit the victim card on its huge liberal base, considering the way the DNC rigged the primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton when they were competing for the nomination.\n\nNaturally, it\u2019s because of this reality that Sanders is avoiding any question related to his family and wife.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/senator-sanders-cancels-interview-journalist-wouldnt-agree-family-questions-off-limits/", "author": ["Luis Orozco"]}, {"title": "You\u2019re \u201cLucky I Don\u2019t Know How To Build A Bomb\u201d: Muslim Student Admits Trying to Kill Children At School", "text": "When many people think about terrorism, bombs are often where the mind goes. Not all terrorists use bombs or even have the skills to do so. In a recent court case against a terror suspect who set fires, the courtroom was stunned as the accused shared she was not successful in killing more simply because she did not know how to make bombs. She stated that the local community was \u201c\u2026lucky I don\u2019t know how to build a bomb.\u201d\n\nThe suspect is 19-year-old Muslim Tnuza Jamal Hassan. She was arrested on one count of arson tied to 8 fires set at the St. Paul campus of the St. Catherine\u2019s University. Hassan was enrolled at the college in the fall as a freshman but dropped out shortly after that. She was hoping to kill children at the school to gain national and possibly worldwide attention.\n\nWhen small fires started to break out all over the campus in Minneapolis, school officials did not have any idea why they were set. There was nothing to indicate these were tied to any particular terrorist group until the story about the suspect began to emerge. Hassan made no efforts to hide the fact this was an attack at the hands of jihad with the intent to kill as many people as possible.\n\nHassan shared that she set the fires to get revenge for school fires she read about online. She shared that she knew American troops were burning schools in Iraq and Afghanistan, so she felt like she should do the same thing here.\n\nBeyond sharing her reason for the fires, Hassan also shared that she was not happy with the outcomes of the fires. She set a series of 8 small fires and was disappointed that the fires did not kill anyone. It seems she set them to burn the school to the ground and kill as many as possible.\n\nAt one point during the arsons, Hassan targeted Saint Mary\u2019s Hall. This is a dorm that also houses a daycare. She was hoping to burn it down and kill both women and children to get more attention. At the time the fire was set there were 33 children and eight adults at risk.\n\nHassan not only started a fire in a bathroom within Saint Mary\u2019s Hall but also went on to set 7 more fires. The fires were spread out all over campus in the hopes that the sheer number of fires would leave personal pulled so thin they could not put them all out. Her careful planning was set into place to create chaos and try to keep starting more fires as campus workers worked to put the others out.\n\nAs each fire was set on campus, officials began to try to see a pattern. They quickly realized they were dealing with a significant threat and worked to stop the fire setting. Police looked at on-campus security cameras and found footage of Hassan setting the fires.\n\nHassan was arrested the afternoon of the fires in a dorm room. She was brought up on one count of arson even though they confirmed there were a total of 8 fires set. There is no explanation as to why she was only charged with setting one of the fires.\n\nDuring interviews with police, Hassan made it very clear she intended to kill strangers. She was not setting fires to do property damage; she was out for blood. There are many within the local community that want to know why she was not charged with attempted murder. When she set the fire at Saint Mary\u2019s Hall, she did so to kill as many of the 33 children and eight adults that were there as possible. It would seem logical to charge her with 41 counts of attempted murder as well. In all total, it appears that the suspect has walked away with a bare minimum of charges for a severe terrorist attack.\n\nFor those who are dismissing these fires as not being serious, something that the suspect said in court upon her first appearance may change that. It seems the young defendant was not overly sorry for her efforts, in fact very much the opposite. She expressed frustration that her efforts did not end in any deaths. She also shared that the campus was lucky that she did not know how to make bombs as she would have done so. The amateur fires set that day was not what she intended to do, but she did not have the needed skills to carry out a more massive scale attack alone.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/youre-lucky-dont-know-build-bomb-muslim-student-admits-trying-kill-children-school/", "author": ["April Horning"]}, {"title": "Trump Defies California, Causes Leftist Outrage By Providing Farmers With Water", "text": "President Trump\u2019s administration, thanks to scientists who understand facts, has reversed findings involving California\u2019s water. A decades old opinion concerning \u2018endangered species\u2019 has been changed, thanks to new data on various types of fish, allowing much needed water to the state\u2019s farmers.\n\nThe president signed an order on Wednesday to re-engineer the state\u2019s water plans, fulfilling a campaign promise to funnel water from northern areas to agriculture industries further south.\n\nNaturally, the move prompted outrage from the democrat controlled state, which would apparently rely on \u201coutdated\u201d opinions that protected a non-endangered fish over providing a much needed resource to human beings.\n\nThe Hill reported:\n\nTrump said the changes to the \u201coutdated scientific research and biological opinions\u201d would now help direct \u201cas much water as possible, which will be a magnificent amount, a massive amount of water for the use of California farmers and ranchers.\u201d\n\n\u201cA major obstacle to providing water for the region\u2019s farmers has now been totally eliminated by the federal government,\u201d Trump said Wednesday in Bakersfield, Calif., flanked by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), as well as Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who helped shepherd the changes to the state\u2019s water policy.\n\nTrump\u2019s order comes as the state has taken several steps to deal with the water scarcity that has lasted for decades.\n\n\u201cIt would be different if you had a drought,\u201d Trump claimed, despite concerns the state may be headed into another drought. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a drought.

In October of last year, Interior released a new biological opinion limiting the longtime protections for the fish.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s speech, Trump gave repeated kudos to Bernhardt, who has been mired in controversy for his past work for Westlands Water District, one of the groups pushing to expand water access for central California\u2019s ag industry.\n\nReporting from The New York Times found that Bernhardt continued to work for Westlands as late as April 2017, the month he was nominated to his previous role as deputy secretary of the department. He filed paperwork to end his status as a federal lobbyist in November 2016.\n\nInterior said Bernhardt had \u201cengaged in various legal services\u201d to support Westlands \u2014 but not lobbying.\n\nThe story spurred a call from Democratic lawmakers to investigate Bernhardt\u2019s lobbying work and in turn a commitment from Interior\u2019s Office of the Inspector General in April of last year to review seven complaints alleging conflicts of interest or potential ethics violations by Bernhardt.\n\nInterior said its decision to change protections for the fish was not tied to Bernhardt\u2019s past employer.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no connection,\u201d Paul Souza, a regional Fish and Wildlife Service official, said when the decision was rolled out, adding that he and the others who worked on the issue were \u201ccareer professionals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have led these efforts with our team over the past year and these are career professional documentation,\u201d he added.\n\nBut environmentalists have viewed the latest biological review with skepticism.\n\n\u2026\n\nTrump took various jabs at California\u2019s Democratic leadership, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, while lavishing praise on the Republican delegation members that were present.\n\n\u201cAfter decades of failure and delays in ensuring critical water access for the people of this state, we are determined to finally get your problem solved,\u201d Trump said, referring to the state\u2019s previous water policy as a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy also praised Trump for fulfilling his campaign promise to divert more water to farmers in California.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it great to have a president who understands farming is not easy?\u201d he said before the president came on stage. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great to have a president who keeps his promises?\u201d", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/trump-defies-california-causes-leftist-outrage-by-providing-farmers-with-water/", "author": []}, {"title": "Jordan, Meadows Moved To Top Positions On Key House Committees", "text": "Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows, both GOP Reps. are being moved to top positions within key House committees.\n\nJordan will take over the leadership of the Judiciary Committee, and Meadows on the House Oversight.

In that case, the appeals court said the crime occurred on land assigned to the tribe before Oklahoma became a state and Congress never clearly eliminated the Creek Nation reservation it created in 1866.\n\nThe case the justices decided Thursday involved 71-year-old Jimcy McGirt, who is serving a 500-year prison sentence for molesting a child. Oklahoma state courts rejected his argument that his case does not belong in Oklahoma courts and that federal prosecutors should instead handle his case.\n\nMcGirt could potentially be retried in federal court, as could Patrick Murphy, who was convicted of killing a fellow tribe member in 1999 and sentenced to death. But Murphy would not face the death penalty in federal court for a crime in which prosecutors said he mutilated the victim and left him to bleed to death on the side of a country road about 80 miles southeast of Tulsa.\n\nAtlanta Journal Constitution reported:\n\n\u201cOn the far end of the Trail of Tears was a promise. Forced to leave their ancestral lands in Georgia and Alabama, the Creek Nation received assurances that their new lands in the West would be secure forever. \u2026 Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law.

Other major areas of recovery were in retail (more than 700,000 jobs), education (more than 500,000 jobs), and manufacturing (more than 300,000), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported on July 2.\n\n\u201cEighty percent of small businesses are now open and we think we\u2019re going to have some very good numbers in the coming months, because others are opening,\u201d President Donald Trump commented during a July 2 press briefing at the White House.\n\nTrump also touted the rise in consumer confidence, retail sales, and the number of workers re-entering the labor force.\n\n\u201cThe crisis is being handled,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the situation with COVID-19, the disease caused by the CCP virus, is \u201cgetting under control,\u201d although he acknowledged that there are areas where it has \u201cflared up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are putting out the fires,\u201d he said.\n\nUnemployment dropped to 11.1 percent from 13.3 percent the month before.\n\nThe shutdowns sent unemployment on a roller coaster ride as the rate spiked to 14.7 percent in April from 3.5 percent in February. Since then, the economy has been recovering.\n\nThe measurement of the unemployment rate continued to be biased lower by people incorrectly misclassifying themselves as being \u201cemployed but absent from work\u201d last month. The unemployment rate would have been 12.1 percent without the misclassification problem, the BLS said.\n\nHiring in June was boosted by the typically low-paying leisure and hospitality industry, which added 2.1 million jobs, accounting for about two-fifths of the gains in payrolls. The return of these workers pushed down average wages by 1.2 percent in June.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the results today. Between this month and last month, that\u2019s about 8 million jobs, about 8 million people we\u2019ve put back to work,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. He said the administration\u2019s work wouldn\u2019t be done until every person who lost their job amid the shutdowns regains employment.\n\nThe unemployment rate dropped the most for Hispanics (to 14.5 percent from 17.6 percent), then whites (to 10.1 percent from 12.4 percent), followed by blacks (to 15.4 percent from 16.8 percent) and Asians (to 13.8 percent from 15 percent).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of hardship, and a lot of heartbreak in these numbers,\u201d said Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s economic adviser. \u201cI understand that. The economy is on its way back, but we have a ways to go.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized, though, that the economists are predicting a major recovery in the third quarter.\n\nRegarding the rising numbers of virus cases in some areas, Mnuchin said the states are \u201cacting appropriately\u201d by pausing the reopening of \u201cmore contagious\u201d settings such as bars and gyms.\n\n\u201cWe think there is the right balance, and we\u2019re working with the states on the health issues and the economic issues,\u201d he said.\n\nThe majority of the spike in virus cases in the past week has been concentrated in some 60 counties, largely in Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona.\n\nAverage hourly earnings at private companies fell 1.2 percent to $29.39 in June. For rank-and-file workers specifically, hourly earnings declined 0.9 percent to $24.74.\n\nThe reason wasn\u2019t so much that employers imposed pay cuts. Rather, the workers who were rehired in June at bars, restaurants, and other such establishments disproportionately work in lower-paying occupations. That trend pulled down average wages for the month.\n\n\u201cThe decline reflects the extent to which June\u2019s job gains were skewed toward lower-wage, lower-hour industry groups, such as retail trade and leisure and hospitality services,\u201d said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial.\n\nU.S. stocks rallied on the employment data. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.\n\nIn a separate report on July 2, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 55,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.427 million for the week ended June 27. Though claims have declined from a record 6.867 million in late March, progress has been slow.\n\nThe claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 59,000 to 19.290 million in the week ending June 20. These so-called continued claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, have dropped from a record 24.912 million in early May.\n\nThere were 31.5 million people collecting unemployment checks in mid-June. Of those, over 17 million collected the standard state benefits and nearly 13 million the special pandemic-related benefits.\n\nSome big bank analysts stroke a gloomy note on the report, wary of new restrictions that states may impose in response to virus case spikes.\n\n\u201cRemember that the (June jobs) data are capturing the data from the middle of May through the middle of June, given the survey period,\u201d economists at Bank of America Global Research cautioned. \u201cIt captures the state of the labor market before the economy was hit by the rise in virus cases in the Sun Belt.\u201d\n\nJay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities, voiced similar worries.\n\n\u201cWith the number of COVID-19 cases accelerating and some states delaying re-opening or imposing new restrictions, we are concerned that a significant number of individuals may become furloughed again,\u201c he said in a research report. \u201cThe outsized gains in payrolls that were registered in May and June likely won\u2019t be repeated in the next few months.\u201d\n\n4 1/2 million people back to work in June.

Yes, the leaders of the organization \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d are black, they\u2019re also rich, racist Marxists busy counting piles of money, but the people attacking police officers are mostly white.\n\nListening to the rioters, pundits, politicians, and reporters you notice something odd: they all seem to believe black people are incapable of succeeding without their help. This used to be called the \u201cwhite savior complex,\u201d now it\u2019s simply called \u201cprogressive.\u201d\n\nPresident George W. Bush famously and correctly called what liberals were doing to minority students in education \u201cthe soft bigotry of low expectations.\u201d He was right then; now the left has stepped up their game and fully hardened that bigotry.\n\nThe idea that someone can\u2019t succeed in America because of their skin color, gender, whatever, is as stupid as it is bigoted. [Amen!]\n\nWeirdly, it seems to always be espoused by people who\u2019ve \u201csomehow\u201d beaten the odds. How many times have you seen a black Ivy League professor on TV talking about \u201csystemic racism\u201d? How\u2019d they get a tenured, high six-figure gig, book deals, speaking engagements, and a cable news contributor contract in such a rigged system?\n\nThey never answer that question because the only people who\u2019d ask it of them are their colleagues on TV and they\u2019re on the same team. But the answer is obvious: they worked for it; they earned it.\n\nThe woke crowd doesn\u2019t want minorities to realize that, and neither do racists. Both want to keep people down because it serves their needs.\n\nRacists want segregation; wokesters want segregation too. One in the name of bigotry, one in the name of \u201ctolerance.\u201d Does the motive really matter if the outcome is the same?\n\nIn fact, to listen to the demands of the leftists in the streets, you\u2019d think they were the Klan.\n\n\u201cBlack people can\u2019t succeed without government help,\u201d \u201cThey can\u2019t get ahead without a government program,\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll only end up in jail if they don\u2019t get handouts.\u201d Again, seemingly different motivations, but all those statements could\u2019ve been uttered by either group.\n\nThe infantilizing of black people by the progressive left is actually worse than anything the Klan is doing because the KKK is a non-entity in American life in the 21st century.\n\nIn my book, I wrote about the size of the KKK. The Southern Poverty Law Center estimates there are between 5,000-8,000 members of the KKK in 2016, down from about 4 million a century earlier. That\u2019s a huge drop \u2013 to go from millions to a rounding error smaller than the average attendance of a WNBA game as the population tripled should be cause for celebration.\n\nBut leftists will tell you racists are everywhere and running the show.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an accident. The left has redefined the word \u201cracist\u201d to the point that it has no meaning. Now, simply denying that you\u2019re racist is a sign of your racism. George Orwell is spinning so fast in his grave you could power the eastern seaboard if you hooked his coffin up to a turbine.\n\nDemocrats didn\u2019t change their hearts when Civil Rights legislation became law, they just changed their tactics. Segregation is still the order of the day, it\u2019s now being advocated for in the name of multiculturalism. Still, Democrats and racists don\u2019t believe black people are capable of taking care of themselves. Does it really matter why?\n\nGenerations of \u201chelp\u201d from white leftists haven\u2019t helped, which makes you wonder if it was ever designed to? If the KKK had been in charge of social and economic policy for black Americans, what would they have done differently? They would have both funded Planned Parenthood, they would both defend failing public schools from the competition that could improve education, they\u2019d both sit idly by communities and businesses burned and people were put out of work.\n\nThe results would be about the same as every major majority-black city in the country that has been controlled by Democrats for generations.

He took 49 with him.\u2019\n\nThe affidavit also details how Al-Azhari negotiated with an undercover FBI employee to purchase a variety of guns and silencers, including an AK-47-style rifle. He was arrested Sunday after taking possession of weapons allegedly to be used in an attack.\n\n\u2018We are grateful for the hard work and swift action by our law enforcement partners and concerned citizens during this investigation,\u2019 said US Attorney Maria Chapa Lopez, whose district includes Tampa. \u2018Their coordination and cooperation in this matter allowed us to interrupt a serious threat, without harm to anyone.\u2019\n\nAccording to the 62-page FBI affidavit, Al-Azhari scouted a number of targets in the Tampa Bay region, including multiple beaches, Honeymoon Island State Park and even the Tampa FBI field office.\n\nHe also allegedly rehearsed what he would say when carrying out an attack, some of which was intercepted by electronic surveillance on May 16.\n\n\u2018Know America. Today is your emergency. Today we kill from you guys like you killed from us,\u2019 he is overheard saying, according to the affidavit. \u2018This is a revenge for Muslims.\u2019\n\nCourt-ordered searches of Al-Azhari\u2019s iPhone also revealed numerous videos and extremist statements advocating jihad attributed to the Islamic State group. Another video, the FBI says, shows Al-Azhari in a facemask and pointing a gun at presumably someone on the floor.\n\n\u2018Hey you, get on the floor. Get on the floor now. Don\u2019t you move, don\u2019t you move, I\u2019m telling you, I will kill you,\u2019 he says on the video.\n\nThen, Al-Azhari looks into the camera and says: \u2018God willing, the exalted. This is revenge for my brothers Al Muwahideen [the monotheists] in Guantanamo in general, and for my brother [redacted] in particular. \u2026this is a revenge for all my Muslim brothers in Iraq and al-Sham [Syria] and everywhere.\u2019\n\nHe then points the gun at what is presumed to be someone on the floor and says: \u2018those who were killed by the hands of those filthy crusaders.\u2019\n\nAl-Azhari had previously been convicted in Saudi Arabia in 2015 of terror-related crimes, including attempting to travel to Syria to participate in jihad and join a terrorist group along with two others, including his own father.\n\nHe served three years in prison in Saudi Arabia and then was deported back to the US, according to the FBI. He lived in California and since 2019 in the Tampa area.\n\nA key to the case was an eBay transaction in which Al-Hazhari purchased weapons parts for $375 from someone in Texas.\n\nThe package was halted by the US Postal Service and eBay flagged the purchase. The seller then provided FBI agents with details about the deal and the Postal Service seized the package.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, FBI has been aware of Al-Azhari since at least May 2019.\n\nOn May 1, Al-Azhari was arrested for carrying a concealed firearm after allegedly making threats to harm his colleagues at Home Depot.\n\nPrior to his arrest of the state charge, FBI agents interviewed some of his co-workers at the home improvement store, who expressed concern about statements that the suspect had made concerning Islam, guns and violence.\n\nA supervisor told agents that when speaking about the September 11 attacks, Al-Azhari had said that he believed that Americans got what they deserved that day, according to the affidavit.\n\nThe same supervisors also allegedly overheard Al-Azhari speaking to other co-workers about jihad, saying that it involved \u2018defending Islam.\u2019\n\nAnother colleague at the Home Depot had reported Al-Azhari to corporate security, claiming that he tried to convince his co-workers to convert to Islam, and that he \u2018spoke negatively and passionately about the United States and homosexuality.\u2019\n\nAl-Azhari was arrested on Sunday and was being held in the Pinellas County jail at the request of federal agents.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/terror-attack-police-take-out-woman-who-charged-officers-with-butcher-knife/", "author": []}, {"title": "Chicago Officers Ambushed By \u201cOrganized Mobs\u201d: Democrat Militant Wing Beefs Up Attacks", "text": "Last week, liberals and democrats screamed that Chicago police used excessive force during \u2018peaceful demonstrations\u2019 in Grant Park, where mobs of violent agitators destroyed federal property and tore down a statue of Christopher Columbus.\n\nBut, the Chicago PD is defending their actions by releasing video footage that shows officers were actually ambushed by the \u201corganized mob.\u201d\n\nFox News reported:\n\nChicago\u2018s top cop said his officers were ambushed during violent clashes between protesters and police last week near a statue of Christopher Columbus as objects were hurled at officers during heated confrontations between the groups.\n\nPolice Superintendent David Brown said his department has faced \u201corganized actions to provoke violent responses from our officers\u201d during a Monday news briefing where a video of Friday\u2019s events at Grant Park was released.\n\nHe said peaceful demonstrations spanning several weeks have been hijacked by what he called \u201corganized mobs.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the six-minute compilation video released by the Chicago Police Department shows demonstrators dressed in black using umbrellas to shield themselves while hurling frozen water bottles and cans, rocks, explosives and other items at officers. In the video, many officers retreat behind the statue or hold up riot shields during the incident.\n\nProtesters hid behind the umbrellas and banners to change into black clothing, police said. The footage also captures people distributing items to throw at police, while others used sharpened PVC pipe to stab officers, officials said.\n\nBrown said 49 police officers were injured, including one with a broken eye socket and another who had a broken kneecap. Twelve people were arrested for mob action, damage to property and attacking police officers.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be a city that thinks mob action of a crowd is acceptable behavior,\u201d Brown said, noting that when chaotic protests occur, the department is forced to divert manpower from policing high-crime areas.\n\nThe city reported 63 people shot and 12 killed over another violent weekend.\n\nIn response to Friday\u2019s events, Brown said he\u2019s ordered all officers to wear \u201cany and all protective gear\u201d when policing demonstrations.\n\n\u201cWe cannot assume that protests are going to be peaceful, based on these actions and others,\u201d he said.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot said \u201cvigilantes\u201d attended Friday\u2019s protest with intentions of violently engaging with authorities.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not peaceful protest.

Similar confrontations between authorities and demonstrators over memorials and monuments of controversial figures have occurred nationwide.\n\nMiracle Boyd, an 18-year-old activist, said she lost some teeth after being punched by a police officer.

The seat was previously held by career politician and notorious gang of eight RINO Lamar Alexander.\n\nAnd, yesterday, I got a spam text telling me that Manny Sethi couldn\u2019t be trusted by Trump conservatives. So, the race is definitely heating up.\n\nI explained to the caller last week that I don\u2019t have television, but that my husband and I were starting to research the candidates for the primary coming up in about two weeks.\n\nIn fact, although I\u2019m not being brainwashed by the boob-tube\u2026 like many Tennesseans, I\u2019m extremely informed not only about the present, but also about American history and the pivotal role this state has played throughout the nation\u2019s past.\n\nFor example (I\u2019ll make it brief) Tennessee statesmen crafted the method still used today for a state\u2019s inclusion in the union; We\u2019ve sent three presidents to the White House; a republican from Tennessee cast the deciding vote for women\u2019s suffrage; oh yeah, and thanks to Tennessee, Al Gore didn\u2019t get elected president in 2000\u2026 by not carrying his home state, the race in Florida with the \u201changing chads\u201d wouldn\u2019t have mattered.\n\nSide Rant: Incidentally, if you do want to relocate to a land that is beautiful, has four real seasons and is still relatively free, where you can raise your children with the convictions of morality in peace (I\u2019m talking about everywhere but Memphis and Nashville), come on down! You\u2019re welcome!\n\nHowever, if you move here thinking to bring your dipshit-liberal, ass hat ideas here and \u2018educate\u2019 us ignorant hillbillies\u2026 just take yourself off to some other hell hole like the one you\u2019re trying to escape and spread your \u2018enlightenment\u2019 there.\n\nSo, after explaining these things to the caller, who I learned was a recent \u2018transplant\u2019 to our fine state\u2026 he started talking about Dr. Manny.\n\nEverything I heard sounded good. Mask mandates, wrong and stupid. Socialized state healthcare, idiotic. Electoral college, crucial for the existence of the Republic.\n\nRecently, Tennesseans have been betrayed by our Senate picks. I\u2019m not talking about Marsha Blackburn, she\u2019s doing okay. I\u2019m talking about Bob \u2018turncoat\u2019 Corker and Lamar \u2018career politician\u2019 Alexander (he betrayed the state repeatedly over the last four years). And of course, there\u2019s also Bill Lee who has stabbed us all in the back with his leftist leanings.\n\nDr. Manny is an outsider\u2026 Bill Hagerty was hand-picked by the establishment to replace Alexander.\n\nAnd, apparently that fact has Hagarty running scared.\n\nThe Tennessee Star reported:\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Manny Sethi released a statewide ad Thursday criticizing his opponent in the Republican primary, Bill Hagerty, for past connections to Mitt Romney and Al Gore.\n\nThis, according to a press release that Sethi\u2019s campaign emailed Thursday.\n\nSethi\u2019s campaign titled the ad \u201cRomney, Gore, and Common Core.\u201d\n\nIn the press release, Sethi Campaign Chair Chris Devaney said the ad highlights important differences between the two candidates.\n\n\u201cBill Hagerty is attacking Dr. Manny Sethi for giving $50 to a family friend,\u201d Devaney said.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile Hagerty gave $100,000 to Mitt Romney, donated to Al Gore, and Hagerty\u2019s company made millions off Common Core. Hagerty is desperate and scared. He should be\u2014Manny Sethi is winning.\u201d\n\nSethi, in the ad, asks \u201cwhy is the establishment attacking a nice guy like me?\u201d\n\nHagerty campaign spokeswoman Abigail Sigler addressed the ad in an email Thursday. The Tennessee Star specifically asked Sigler about Sethi\u2019s claim that Hagerty made millions of dollars off Common Core and whether it was true.\n\n\u201cOf course, Bill worked to defeat Barack Obama in 2012, unlike Massachusetts Manny Sethi who applied to be in the Obama Biden White House. Manny Sethi\u2019s Never Trumpers have been attacking Bill since the day President Trump endorsed and announced his run for Senate,\u201d Sigler said.\n\n[Yet, Hagerty worked with the Clinton administration. And, the \u2018application\u2019 she\u2019s talking about was not a partisan appointment.]\n\n\u201cPresident Trump looked at all the candidates in this race, and he endorsed Bill because he trusts Bill to stand with him to protect conservative values, get our economy going again, hold China accountable, and stand up for life.\u201d\n\nIn 2009 members of the Obama White House announced on their website that Sethi was one of many national finalists for the 2009-2010 class of White House fellows.\n\nSethi Campaign Manager Forrest Barnwell-Hagemeyer emailed The Star Thursday and offered the following statement:\n\n\u201cHagerty was appointed to the President\u2019s Commission on White House Fellowships by Bill Clinton and re-appointed by Obama. Manny applied for a non-partisan academic fellowship from the Commission, while Hagerty was still on the Commission. Now, Hagerty is attacking Manny for applying to be a part of a group of which Hagerty was a member,\u201d Barnwell-Hagemeyer said adding \u201cit\u2019s all a smokescreen.\u201d\n\nAs The Star reported this month, Hagerty donated $1,000 each to the presidential campaigns of both Al Gore and George W. Bush in the year 2000, according to Federal Election Commission filings. That year Hagerty, according to his LinkedIn page, worked at the private equity investment firm Hagerty Peterson & Company LLC in Nashville, a position he held until July 2017. Hagerty said on his LinkedIn page that he co-founded the company.\n\nSo, we see the mud-slinging has begun.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m leaning toward Dr. Manny. He\u2019s a first generation American and the momentum behind his campaign is growing\u2026 where it counts. Among voters like me who are sprinkled throughout the state and who have a vested interest in keeping Tennessee a beacon of beauty and liberty.\n\nThe real indicator is where the money is coming from\u2026 who\u2019s donating to whose campaign. Hagerty is getting lots of cash from the establishment and is working with Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\nBut, the bottom line is\u2026 the Senate position MUST be secured by a real conservative. If we aren\u2019t together in this\u2026 liberals will tear the house down and destroy the peace we are clinging to by a thread.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/tn-primary-heats-up-name-calling-and-attack-ads-just-the-beginning/", "author": []}, {"title": "\u201cJesus Matters\u201d Preacher Arrested For Damaging BLM Street Painting", "text": "Bevelyn Beatty made headlines a few weeks ago by speaking with white liberals in Seattle, and now, she has gone viral by painting over the Black Lives Matter street murals.\n\nFox News reported:\n\nA Black woman opposing the Black Lives Matter movement, who was arrested Saturday for dumping paint on a BLM street mural outside Trump Tower, livestreamed herself doing the same thing again at similar murals in Harlem and Brooklyn later that evening.\n\nBevelyn Beatty, 29, livestreamed each installment on her Facebook page.

Experts everywhere around the globe have confirmed that schools reopening is the right thing to do, and that it will not cause a massive spike in COVID infections.\n\nBut, democrat senators, governors, and mayors are continually pushing \u201cmask mandates.\u201d They claim that we all have to cover our faces in public\u2026 and some have speculated it is so that facial recognition software can be refined.\n\nBut, what does SCIENCE actually say about using masks to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses?\n\nIt\u2019s actually conclusive\u2026 they don\u2019t work.\n\nDr. Denis G Rancourt, PhD, compiled a list of the latest research and published it:\n\nMasks and respirators do not work. There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles.\n\nFurthermore, the relevant known physics and biology, which I review, are such that masks and respirators should not work. It would be a paradox if masks and respirators worked, given what we know about viral respiratory diseases: The main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles (< 2.5 \u03bcm), which are too fine to be blocked, and the minimum-infective-dose is smaller than one aerosol particle.\n\nThe present paper about masks illustrates the degree to which governments, the mainstream media, and institutional propagandists can decide to operate in a science vacuum, or select only incomplete science that serves their interests. Such recklessness is also certainly the case with the current global lockdown of over 1 billion people, an unprecedented experiment in medical and political history.\n\n[The extensive list of research is included]\n\n\u2026\n\nNo RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. There are no exceptions. Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public (more on this below).\n\nFurthermore, if there were any benefit to wearing a mask, because of the blocking power against droplets and aerosol particles, then there should be more benefit from wearing a respirator (N95) compared to a surgical mask, yet several large meta-analyses, and all the RCT, prove that there is no such relative benefit. Masks and respirators do not work.\n\nPrecautionary Principle turned on its head with masks\n\nIn light of the medical research, therefore, it is difficult to understand why public-health authorities are not consistently adamant about this established scientific result, since the distributed psychological, economic and environmental harm from a broad recommendation to wear masks is significant, not to mention the unknown potential harm from concentration and distribution of pathogens on and from used masks.\n\nIn this case, public authorities would be turning the precautionary principle on its head (see below).\n\nPhysics and Biology of Viral Respiratory Disease, and why masks do not work\n\nIn order to understand why masks cannot possibly work, we must review established knowledge about viral respiratory diseases, the mechanism of seasonal variation of excess deaths from pneumonia and influenza, the aerosol mechanism of infectious disease transmission, the physics and chemistry of aerosols, and the mechanism of the so-called minimum-infective-dose.\n\nIn addition to pandemics that can occur anytime, in the temperate latitudes there is an extra burden of respiratory-disease mortality that is seasonal, and which is caused by viruses. For example, see the review of influenza by Paules and Subbarao (2017). This has been known for a long time, and the seasonal pattern is exceedingly regular.\n\nFor example, see Figure 1 of Viboud (2010), which has \u201cWeekly time series of the ratio of deaths from pneumonia and influenza to all deaths, based on the 122 cities surveillance in the US (blue line). The red line represents the expected baseline ratio in the absence of influenza activity,\u201d here: (See article for graphic)\n\nThe seasonality of the phenomenon was largely not understood until a decade ago. Until recently, it was debated whether the pattern arose primarily because of seasonal change in virulence of the pathogens, or because of seasonal change in susceptibility of the host (such as from dry air causing tissue irritation, or diminished daylight causing vitamin deficiency or hormonal stress). For example, see Dowell (2001).\n\nIn a landmark study, Shaman et al. (2010) showed that the seasonal pattern of extra respiratory-disease mortality can be explained quantitatively on the sole basis of absolute humidity, and its direct controlling impact on transmission of airborne pathogens.\n\nLowen et al. (2007) demonstrated the phenomenon of humidity-dependent airborne-virus virulence in actual disease transmission between guinea pigs, and discussed potential underlying mechanisms for the measured controlling effect of humidity.\n\nThe underlying mechanism is that the pathogen-laden aerosol particles or droplets are neutralized within a half-life that monotonically and significantly decreases with increasing ambient humidity. This is based on the seminal work of Harper (1961). Harper experimentally showed that viral-pathogen-carrying droplets were inactivated within shorter and shorter times, as ambient humidity was increased.\n\nHarper argued that the viruses themselves were made inoperative by the humidity (\u201cviable decay\u201d), however, he admitted that the effect could be from humidity-enhanced physical removal or sedimentation of the droplets (\u201cphysical loss\u201d): \u201cAerosol viabilities reported in this paper are based on the ratio of virus titre to radioactive count in suspension and cloud samples, and can be criticized on the ground that test and tracer materials were not physically identical.\u201d\n\nThe latter (\u201cphysical loss\u201d) seems more plausible to me, since humidity would have a universal physical effect of causing particle / droplet growth and sedimentation, and all tested viral pathogens have essentially the same humidity-driven \u201cdecay\u201d. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand how a virion (of all virus types) in a droplet would be molecularly or structurally attacked or damaged by an increase in ambient humidity. A \u201cvirion\u201d is the complete, infective form of a virus outside a host cell, with a core of RNA or DNA and a capsid. The actual mechanism of such humidity-driven intra-droplet \u201cviable decay\u201d of a virion has not been explained or studied.\n\nIn any case, the explanation and model of Shaman et al. (2010) is not dependant on the particular mechanism of the humidity-driven decay of virions in aerosol / droplets. Shaman\u2019s quantitatively demonstrated model of seasonal regional viral epidemiology is valid for either mechanism (or combination of mechanisms), whether \u201cviable decay\u201d or \u201cphysical loss\u201d.\n\nThe breakthrough achieved by Shaman et al. is not merely some academic point. Rather, it has profound health-policy implications, which have been entirely ignored or overlooked in the current coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn particular, Shaman\u2019s work necessarily implies that, rather than being a fixed number (dependent solely on the spatial-temporal structure of social interactions in a completely susceptible population, and on the viral strain), the epidemic\u2019s basic reproduction number (R0) is highly or predominantly dependent on ambient absolute humidity.\n\nFor a definition of R0, see HealthKnowlege-UK (2020): R0 is \u201cthe average number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population where everyone is susceptible.\u201d The average R0 for influenza is said to be 1.28 (1.19-1.37); see the comprehensive review by Biggerstaff et al. (2014).\n\nIn fact, Shaman et al. showed that R0 must be understood to seasonally vary between humid-summer values of just larger than \u201c1\u201d and dry-winter values typically as large as \u201c4\u201d (for example, see their Table 2). In other words, the seasonal infectious viral respiratory diseases that plague temperate latitudes every year go from being intrinsically mildly contagious to virulently contagious, due simply to the bio-physical mode of transmission controlled by atmospheric humidity, irrespective of any other consideration.\n\nTherefore, all the epidemiological mathematical modelling of the benefits of mediating policies (such as social distancing), which assumes humidity-independent R0 values, has a large likelihood of being of little value, on this basis alone. For studies about modelling and regarding mediation effects on the effective reproduction number, see Coburn (2009) and Tracht (2010).\n\nTo put it simply, the \u201csecond wave\u201d of an epidemic is not a consequence of human sin regarding mask wearing and hand shaking. Rather, the \u201csecond wave\u201d is an inescapable consequence of an air-dryness-driven many-fold increase in disease contagiousness, in a population that has not yet attained immunity.\n\nIf my view of the mechanism is correct (i.e., \u201cphysical loss\u201d), then Shaman\u2019s work further necessarily implies that the dryness-driven high transmissibility (large R0) arises from small aerosol particles fluidly suspended in the air; as opposed to large droplets that are quickly gravitationally removed from the air.\n\nSuch small aerosol particles fluidly suspended in air, of biological origin, are of every variety and are everywhere, including down to virion-sizes (Despres, 2012). It is not entirely unlikely that viruses can thereby be physically transported over inter-continental distances (e.g., Hammond, 1989).\n\nMore to the point, indoor airborne virus concentrations have been shown to exist (in day-care facilities, health centres, and onboard airplanes) primarily as aerosol particles of diameters smaller than 2.5 \u03bcm, such as in the work of Yang et al. (2011):\n\n\u201cHalf of the 16 samples were positive, and their total virus concentrations ranged from 5800 to 37 000 genome copies m\u22123. On average, 64 per cent of the viral genome copies were associated with fine particles smaller than 2.5 \u00b5m, which can remain suspended for hours. Modelling of virus concentrations indoors suggested a source strength of 1.6 \u00b1 1.2 \u00d7 105 genome copies m\u22123 air h\u22121 and a deposition flux onto surfaces of 13 \u00b1 7 genome copies m\u22122 h\u22121 by Brownian motion. Over 1 hour, the inhalation dose was estimated to be 30 \u00b1 18 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), adequate to induce infection. These results provide quantitative support for the idea that the aerosol route could be an important mode of influenza transmission.\u201d\n\nSuch small particles (< 2.5 \u03bcm) are part of air fluidity, are not subject to gravitational sedimentation, and would not be stopped by long-range inertial impact. This means that the slightest (even momentary) facial misfit of a mask or respirator renders the design filtration norm of the mask or respirator entirely irrelevant. In any case, the filtration material itself of N95 (average pore size ~0.3\u22120.5 \u03bcm) does not block virion penetration, not to mention surgical masks. For example, see Balazy et al. (2006).\n\nMask stoppage efficiency and host inhalation are only half of the equation, however, because the minimal infective dose (MID) must also be considered. For example, if a large number of pathogen-laden particles must be delivered to the lung within a certain time for the illness to take hold, then partial blocking by any mask or cloth can be enough to make a significant difference.\n\nOn the other hand, if the MID is amply surpassed by the virions carried in a single aerosol particle able to evade mask-capture, then the mask is of no practical utility, which is the case.\n\nYezli and Otter (2011), in their review of the MID, point out relevant features:\n\nmost respiratory viruses are as infective in humans as in tissue culture having optimal laboratory susceptibility\n\nit is believed that a single virion can be enough to induce illness in the host\n\nthe 50%-probability MID (\u201cTCID50\u201d) has variably been found to be in the range 100\u22121000 virions\n\nthere are typically 103\u2212107 virions per aerolized influenza droplet with diameter 1 \u03bcm \u2212 10 \u03bcm\n\nthe 50%-probability MID easily fits into a single (one) aerolized droplet\n\nFor further background:\n\nA classic description of dose-response assessment is provided by Haas (1993).\n\nZwart et al. (2009) provided the first laboratory proof, in a virus-insect system, that the action of a single virion can be sufficient to cause disease.\n\nBaccam et al. (2006) calculated from empirical data that, with influenza A in humans, \u201cwe estimate that after a delay of ~6 h, infected cells begin producing influenza virus and continue to do so for ~5 h. The average lifetime of infected cells is ~11 h, and the half-life of free infectious virus is ~3 h. We calculated the [in-body] basic reproductive number, R0, which indicated that a single infected cell could produce ~22 new productive infections.\u201d\n\nBrooke et al. (2013) showed that, contrary to prior modeling assumptions, although not all influenza-A-infected cells in the human body produce infectious progeny (virions), nonetheless, 90% of infected cell are significantly impacted, rather than simply surviving unharmed.\n\nAll of this to say that: if anything gets through (and it always does, irrespective of the mask), then you are going to be infected. Masks cannot possibly work. It is not surprising, therefore, that no bias-free study has ever found a benefit from wearing a mask or respirator in this application.\n\nTherefore, the studies that show partial stopping power of masks, or that show that masks can capture many large droplets produced by a sneezing or coughing mask-wearer, in light of the above-described features of the problem, are irrelevant. For example, see such studies as these: Leung (2020), Davies (2013), Lai (2012), and Sande (2008).\n\nWhy there can never be an empirical test of a nationwide mask-wearing policy\n\nAs mentioned above, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public. There is good reason for this. It would be impossible to obtain unambiguous and bias-free results:\n\nAny benefit from mask-wearing would have to be a small effect, since undetected in controlled experiments, which would be swamped by the larger effects, notably the large effect from changing atmospheric humidity.\n\nMask compliance and mask adjustment habits would be unknown.\n\nMask-wearing is associated (correlated) with several other health behaviours; see Wada (2012).\n\nThe results would not be transferable, because of differing cultural habits.\n\nCompliance is achieved by fear, and individuals can habituate to fear-based propaganda , and can have disparate basic responses.\n\n, and can have disparate basic responses. Monitoring and compliance measurement are near-impossible, and subject to large errors.\n\nSelf-reporting (such as in surveys) is notoriously biased, because individuals have the self-interested belief that their efforts are useful .\n\n. Progression of the epidemic is not verified with reliable tests on large population samples, and generally relies on non-representative hospital visits or admissions.\n\nSeveral different pathogens (viruses and strains of viruses) causing respiratory illness generally act together, in the same population and/or in individuals, and are not resolved, while having different epidemiological characteristics.\n\nUnknown aspects of mask-wearing\n\nMany potential harms may arise from broad public policies to wear masks, and the following unanswered questions arise:\n\nDo used and loaded masks become sources of enhanced transmission, for the wearer and others?\n\nDo masks become collectors and retainers of pathogens that the mask wearer would otherwise avoid when breathing without a mask?\n\nAre large droplets captured by a mask atomized or aerolized into breathable components? Can virions escape an evaporating droplet stuck to a mask fiber?\n\nWhat are the dangers of bacterial growth on a used and loaded mask?\n\nHow do pathogen-laden droplets interact with environmental dust and aerosols captured on the mask?\n\nWhat are long-term health effects on HCW, such as headaches, arising from impeded breathing?\n\nAre there negative social consequences to a masked society?\n\nAre there negative psychological consequences to wearing a mask, as a fear-based behavioural modification?\n\nWhat are the environmental consequences of mask manufacturing and disposal?\n\nDo the masks shed fibres or substances that are harmful when inhaled?\n\nConclusion\n\nBy making mask-wearing recommendations and policies for the general public, or by expressly condoning the practice, governments have both ignored the scientific evidence and done the opposite of following the precautionary principle.\n\nIn an absence of knowledge, governments should not make policies that have a hypothetical potential to cause harm. The government has an onus barrier before it instigates a broad social-engineering intervention, or allows corporations to exploit fear-based sentiments.\n\nFurthermore, individuals should know that there is no known benefit arising from wearing a mask in a viral respiratory illness epidemic, and that scientific studies have shown that any benefit must be residually small, compared to other and determinative factors.\n\nOtherwise, what is the point of publicly-funded science?\n\nThe present paper about masks illustrates the degree to which governments, the mainstream media, and institutional propagandists can decide to operate in a science vacuum, or select only incomplete science that serves their interests. Such recklessness is also certainly the case with the current global lockdown of over 1 billion people, an unprecedented experiment in medical and political history.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/science-proves-respirators-and-masks-do-not-prevent-transmission-of-respiratory-virus/", "author": []}]}, "dailybuzzlive": {"link": "http://dailybuzzlive.com/category/news/", "articles": [{"title": "Village People Kick Out Police Officer", "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 Popular disco group the Village People announced they had severed ties with Victor Willis, better known as the Cop from the Village People, in the aftermath of yet another extrajudicial killing by police of an unarmed black person.\n\n\u201cWhile it goes without saying the Village People support the Black Lives Matter movement, their appearance at last year\u2019s Riot Fest should be a clear indicator on their views of the police state,\u201d noted spokesperson Connie Hayes. \u201cAccordingly, the group has informed Mister Willis that his services in the group were no longer needed.

It\u2019s unclear what prompted them to stop at that location.\n\nEarlier in the day, the \u201cWall of Moms\u201d (and dads) gathered at Salmon Street Springs Park before marching to the Justice Center area in an effort to protect younger protesters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just moms that are tired of seeing other community members get hurt,\u201d one mom named Heather told KOIN 6 News. The moms made their first coordinated appearance at the protests last weekend and have been welcomed into the fold by demonstrators, as has the group of dads that showed up Monday night.\n\nThe moms have been trying to separate protesters and the federal officers, as well as helping people wash their eyes and recover from exposure to tear gas. Their close proximity to the action means they\u2019re often the first to feel the effects of crowd control munitions.\n\n\u201cComing out, you kind of know what to expect in a way,\u201d said Courtney, another mom. \u201cBut it\u2019s nothing compared to childbirth.\u201d\n\nFederal agents in downtown Portland for the city\u2019s 54th straight night of demonstrations, July 21, 2020.

A large portion of plywood was torn from the building as well.\n\n1:00 a.m.\n\nPolice say a fire hydrant was opened by protesters around 1 a.m. A few people reportedly added soap to the water.

Federal officers began launching tear gas, flash bangs, and pepper balls just before 12:30 a.m. Tuesday. The Portland Police Bureau said demonstrators had attempted to break into the federal courthouse, prying back plywood while donned in helmets, gas masks and shields. People reportedly used crowbars and other tools to penetrate the makeshift wooden exterior, breaking at least one glass window, before being rushed by federal law enforcement.\n\nClashes continued for about an hour before federal officers retreated. Small fires were lit at the Federal Courthouse and County Courthouse later on, drawing Portland Fire and Rescue to the scene and sparking additional responses from federal police.\n\nOfficers arrested five people on charges including assault on a federal officer, failure to comply, trespass, and creating a disturbance.

He has a flair for publicity \u2014 at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, he wore a gas mask to the House floor, a stunt that provoked widespread public reaction.\n\nBut he\u2019s has been a minor player legislatively; he doesn\u2019t pass many bills and has never been involved with high-stakes negotiations. Yet the media has become enamored with the 38-year-old lawmaker. He is an ardent defender of Roger Stone and lobbied Trump for his pardon.\n\nGaetz\u2019s spending has already been under review. The Office of Congressional Ethics recently dropped an investigation into Gaetz\u2019s office rental agreement after POLITICO reported in April that he had rented his office in Pensacola, Fla., from a longtime friend, political donor and policy adviser. Both the friend \u2014 local businessman Collier Merrill \u2014 and Gaetz said the rental deal was hashed out privately and below market value.\n\nPOLITICO began examining Gaetz\u2019s office operations at the beginning of June. In the House\u2019s disbursement report \u2014 which covers virtually all of the chamber\u2019s expenditures \u2014 Gaetz disclosed 14 separate $2,000 payments to Presidential Communications and Strategies, a limited liability company that appeared to be registered by an unidentified agent in a tiny town in Wyoming. The checks were sent to an apartment in Arlington, Va., according to sources familiar with the arrangement.\n\nThe payments were to Beattie, according to multiple sources familiar with the arrangement. Gaetz announced hiring Beattie as a speech-writing adviser in April 2019, but he was never added to Gaetz\u2019s congressional payroll, according to House disbursement records. Instead, Gaetz paid him through the Wyoming-based LLC.\n\n\u201cSpeech writers,\u201d \u201ccommunications advisers\u201d and political consultants all fall in the category of outside hires that individual lawmakers are barred from using taxpayer money to retain. Consultants may be hired for some services, including maintenance, janitorial work or technical assistance. Under special circumstances, and with prior approval of House officials, lawmakers may be permitted to hire consultants for legal matters.\n\nThe agreement involving the speech-writing consultant appears to have begun after Beattie was ousted from the Trump administration after his appearance at the H.L. Mencken Club Conference. The Southern Poverty Law Center calls attendees of the conference \u201ca band of white nationalists, pseudo academic and academic racists.\u201d Gaetz announced on Twitter that he would hire Beattie \u2014 who holds a doctorate in political science from Duke University \u2014 as a special adviser for speech writing last April.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Beattie did not respond to a request for comment. Notes left at the apartment to which the checks were sent went unanswered.\n\nAfter ignoring inquiries about the payments to the arrangement with Beattie for six weeks, Gaetz\u2019s office replied Friday evening via chief of staff Jillian Lane Wyant: \u201cAlthough the contractual arrangement was approved by the necessary House authorities, a second review by the Finance Office determined that the services could not be contracted for in exactly that fashion, and our office is currently working through the best way to proceed with both Finance and the House Ethics Committee.\n\n\u201cThe funds were all immediately returned to the House as soon as the review determined this was not the right way to structure this,\u201d Wyant added. \u201cThis is nothing more than a glorified clerical error \u2013 and while it is baffling that Politico should find this newsworthy \u2013 it is disappointing Politico plots to demean individuals who\u2019ve made an innocent clerical mistake and are working to correct it.\u201d\n\nGaetz was likewise circumspect about the television studio. On July 9, the Florida Republican\u2019s office said he uses his allowable allotment of taxpayer funds to pay $100 per month to \u201crent a camera to communicate with constituents and the nation.\u201d It said the \u201chard costs\u201d were covered by a private company, which then charges television networks each time they connect to the studio. Gaetz, they said, is not involved in the transactions.\n\nThe $100 fee is not evident on any of the congressman\u2019s spending records, and his office did not respond to requests about the private company that\u2019s profiting off of his television appearances.\n\n", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/gaetz-florida-house-ethics-rules-377098", "author": []}, {"title": "Congress considers removing Chief Justice Roger B. Taney bust", "text": "The vote comes as communities nationwide re-examine the people memorialized with statues.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The House will vote on whether to remove from the U.S. Capitol a bust of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the author of the 1857 Dred Scott decision that declared African Americans couldn't be citizens.\n\nThe vote expected Wednesday will come as communities nationwide re-examine the people they're memorializing with statues.\n\nThe 2-foot-high marble bust of Taney is outside a room in the Capitol where the Supreme Court met for half a century, from 1810 to 1860. It was in that room that Taney, the nation's fifth chief justice, announced the Dred Scott decision, sometimes called the worst decision in the court's history.\n\nThere\u2019s at least one potentially surprising vote for Taney to stay. Lynne M. Jackson, Scott's great-great-granddaughter, says if it were up to her, she'd leave Taney's bust where it is. But she said she\u2019d add something too: a bust of Dred Scott.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really a fan of wiping things out,\" Jackson said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press earlier this week from her home in Missouri.\n\nThe president and founder of The Dred Scott Heritage Foundation, Jackson has seen other Taney sculptures removed in recent years, particularly in Taney's native Maryland, where he was the state's attorney general before becoming U.S. attorney general and then chief justice.\n\nBut Taney's name and likeness remain in plenty of other places. Missouri has a Taney County. Philadelphia has a Taney Street. And another Taney bust sits alongside all other former chief justices in the Supreme Court's Great Hall, a soaring, marble-columned corridor that leads to the courtroom. A portrait of Taney hangs in one of the court's conference rooms.\n\nJackson said she believes that what memorials honoring figures like Taney need is context. At the Capitol, the Taney statue sits in the \"place where the Dred Scott case was decided,\u201d but the fact he is \u201dthere by himself is lopsided,\u201d Jackson said in suggesting a bust of Scott be added. She had proposed a similar fix for the Taney statue in Annapolis.\n\nThe bill lawmakers will vote on Wednesday proposes replacing the Taney bust with one of Justice Thurgood Marshall, who in 1967 became the Supreme Court's first Black justice. A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate, but prospects for passage there are uncertain.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has opposed the removal of historic statues elsewhere. And he's strongly condemned those who toppled statues during protests over racial injustice and police brutality following the May death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nIn Congress, Taney's bust was controversial from the start. When Illinois Sen. Lyman Trumbull proposed its creation in 1865, shortly after Taney's death, he got into a heated debate with Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner, a fierce opponent of slavery.\n\n\u201cLet me tell that Senator that the name of Taney is to be hooted down the page of history. Judgment is beginning now,\" Sumner said. \"And an emancipated country will fasten upon him the stigma which he deserves.\u201d\n\nFunding for a Taney bust wasn't approved until almost a decade later. Today, near the Taney bust, inside the old Supreme Court chamber, there are also busts of the nation's first four chief justices. The first, John Marshall, is the only person to serve as chief justice longer than Taney and a revered figure in the law.\n\nBut Marshall too was a deeply flawed man, as were other justices, said Paul Finkelman, the president of Gratz College in Pennsylvania and the author of \u201cSupreme Injustice: Slavery in the Nation\u2019s Highest Court.\" Marshall bought slaves most of his life, a fact his biographers largely ignored, and was hostile to the idea of Blacks gaining their freedom, Finkelman said. Before the Civil War, probably the majority of justices owned slaves, he said.", "link": "https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/chief-justice-roger-b-taney-bust-removal-capitol/507-f7483d56-2634-4405-bf9e-c509f4570212", "author": []}, {"title": "Labour pays out six-figure sum and apologises in antisemitism row", "text": "\n\nThe Labour party has apologised \u201cunreservedly\u201d and paid out a six-figure sum to seven former employees and a veteran BBC journalist, admitting it defamed them in the aftermath of a Panorama investigation into its handling of antisemitism.\n\nThe settlement and formal apologies to both the reporter, John Ware, and the ex-employees, which have been read in open court, is believed to have cost the Labour party around \u00a3600,000, with about \u00a3180,000 in damages agreed for the eight individuals.\n\nThe settlement is believed to be an unprecedented case of a political party libelling a journalist and former employees.\n\nLabour conceded it had made defamatory and false allegations against the litigants in the light of their interview with the Panorama programme Is Labour Antisemitic?, broadcast last July.\n\nIt agreed to retract and withdraw accusations that the whistleblowers were motivated by their opposition to the party\u2019s former leader Jeremy Corbyn and had \u201cpolitical axes to grind\u201d and its accusation that Ware had conducted a \u201cdeliberate and malicious misrepresentations designed to mislead the public\u201d.\n\nIn a four-page agreement statement made in relation to the former staff\u2019s libel action read out in court 37 of the high court, it said: \u201cThe Labour party is here today to publicly set the record straight, and to apologise to the claimants for the distress and embarrassment that it has caused them.\u201d\n\nTo Ware, it said in a three-page statement: \u201cThe defendant is here today to set the record straight and to apologise unreservedly to Mr Ware.\u201d\n\nBoth statements disclosed that \u201csubstantial damages\u201d were being paid out while at the same time pointedly referring to the Labour party being led by Corbyn at the time the libel occurred. The apology was handed down after Corbyn and his former head of communications, Seumas Milne, sought legal advice over its wording. Allies of Corbyn believe the case could have been successfully contested.\n\nLouise Withers-Green, one of the whistleblowers who worked in the party\u2019s complaints department, said the former employees had endured a torrent of abuse since the programme had aired.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it is closing a chapter where the libel against us has been retracted, but this is only a first step for the party in beginning to tackle antisemitism,\u201d she told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cI had never expected the party to welcome the Panorama programme with open arms. But I had been expecting them to take responsibility in the long-term for what was happening and truly want to take action.

Antisemitism has been a stain on the Labour party in recent years,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt has caused unacceptable and unimaginable levels of grief and distress for many in the Jewish community, as well as members of staff.\n\n\u201cIf we are to restore the trust of the Jewish community, we must demonstrate a change of leadership. That means being open, transparent and respecting the right of whistleblowers. We are determined to deliver that change.\u201d\n\nIn the programme, eight whistleblowers, seven of whom then sued the party, broke non-disclosure agreements to tell the BBC that they felt fatally undermined by senior Labour bosses in their attempts to tackle antisemitism, alleging consistent interference in complaints.\n\nThe ex-staffers, Withers-Green, Sam Matthews, Kat Buckingham, Dan Hogan, Ben Westerman, Martha Robinson, and Michael Creighton, worked in the Labour party\u2019s governance and legal unit and were responsible for investigation of allegations of misconduct by party members.\n\nThe party said it accepted that a statement put out ahead of the broadcast \u201ccontained defamatory and false allegations about the whistleblowers\u201d, which was sent to national newspapers and broadcasters, as well as \u201cJeremy Corbyn-supporting blogs and websites including the Canary, Skwawkbox and Novara Media and many individuals on social media platforms\u201d.\n\nLabour admitted it had wrongly accused one of the whistleblowers of \u201cmaking a false and malicious statement\u201d and accusing them of acting in \u201cbad faith\u201d and working to harm the Labour party.\n\n\u201cThe Labour party acknowledges that these claims about the claimants are untrue, and we retract and withdraw them and undertake not to repeat them,\u201d the statement said.\n\nLawyer Mark Lewis, of Patron Law, who represented Ware and the whistleblowers, said the case was \u201cunprecedented\u201d. Individual politicians had faced legal challenge by journalists they had libelled in the past, but \u201cI cannot think of a case in which a political party was sued for libel\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cLabour chose to double down and attack the programme\u2019s presenter, John Ware, and the whistleblowers rather than addressing the truth of the problem. It is ironic that the workers\u2019 party chose to act as disgruntled bosses who had been caught out.\u201d\n\nWare, 72, launched proceedings after being subjected to what he said was an avalanche of abuse and criticism by Corbyn supporters.\n\nOne year later, Labour admitted it had wrongly accused him of having \u201cinvented quotes, flouted journalistic ethics and that, in pursuit of a predetermined outcome to the question asked by the Panorama programme \u2026 [and] knowingly promoted falsehoods, including by misrepresentations of fact and, by fabricating facts\u201d.\n\nThe party said it \u201cunreservedly withdraws these allegations and is profoundly sorry for the distress caused by their publication and republication\u201d.\n\nCounsel for Labour, Anthony Hudson, QC, said the party also acknowledged the claims were untrue. \u201cWe retract and withdraw them, and undertake not to repeat them,\u201d he said.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said its journalism had been \u201csubject to an extraordinary and vitriolic attack by the Labour party\u201d and said the apology was long overdue.\n\n\u201cWe applaud their strength to take this case forward and are pleased it has been recognised in court that these extremely serious and damaging allegations against them were false and have been unreservedly withdrawn. John Ware is a reporter with an extraordinary record of excellence at Panorama for investigative journalism in the public interest.\u201d\n\nLabour is awaiting the final publication findings of the Equality and Human Rights Commission\u2019s (EHRC) investigation into allegations of institutional antisemitism. The party revealed this week it had received a draft of the report.\n\nMany of the key individuals involved during the period under investigation, including the former general secretary Jennie Formby, Corbyn\u2019s chief of staff, Karie Murphy, the head of complaints, Thomas Gardiner, and the director of communications, Milne, have now left their roles at the party.\n\nThe party is also set for further potentially damaging recriminations over a leaked internal report that detailed a \u201chyper-factional\u201d environment that hampered complaints procedures because of hostility to Corbyn\u2019s leadership.\n\nSeveral of the whistleblowers involved in Panorama were named in the report, which is the subject of an independent review chaired by the QC Martin Forde.\n\nIn the statements read in court on Wednesday, the party said its apology in both cases was not intended to have any influence on the EHRC or Forde\u2019s investigation.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/22/labour-pays-out-six-figure-sum-and-apologises-in-antisemitism-row", "author": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Jessica Elgot", "Sienna Rodgers", "John Mcdonnell"]}, {"title": "Daphne Caruana Galizia murder: middleman found with stab wounds ahead of court date", "text": "Go-between in car bombing of Maltese journalist was found in pool of blood despite 24-hour police guard\n\nThe self-confessed middleman in the murder of the Maltese anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia has suffered multiple knife injuries to his neck, torso and wrist, hours before he was due to give evidence in the case.\n\nMelvin Theuma, a former taxi driver, was found in a pool of blood at his home on Tuesday evening and was rushed to hospital where he underwent surgery.

Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who according to multiple officials was incensed at the push to boost spending levels, asked his colleagues at the lunch with the administration negotiators, according to several people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the exchange.\n\nThe whole process now appears likely to spill into August, something the White House and congressional Democrats had hoped to avoid, because it would mean more than 20 million Americans would lose emergency unemployment benefits when they expire at the end of this month. They have not mapped out a plan for what would happen to these people as the pandemic\u2019s turmoil continues to weigh on the U.S. economy.\n\nPart of the problem stemmed from the White House\u2019s failure to go into the talks with a preset strategy or a list of proposals that they knew GOP lawmakers would rally behind. This miscalculation created immediate problems. Numerous demands the White House had tried to formulate over the weekend were erased within hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday that the goal was to keep the spending bill around $1 trillion, but by Tuesday he had abandoned that. White House officials also indicated they would no longer push for cuts to testing and the CDC. And after a barrage of criticism of Trump\u2019s tax cut demand, White House officials stopped trying to press the matter.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to spend what we need to spend, and we\u2019re going to make sure we don\u2019t spend more than that,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nDemocrats pointed fingers at the Republican infighting and said the White House and GOP leaders were unprepared to handle the country\u2019s mounting economic and health care challenges. House Democrats passed a $3 trillion spending bill in May that would send another round of stimulus checks, provide more money to states and help hospitals, among other things, but the White House has vowed to block it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRepublicans are in complete disarray,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. \u201cTotally incompetent. Totally in disarray. Totally at war with one another.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to bridge differences, Mnuchin, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow met with Senate Republicans over lunch. But that led to little progress, as Republicans made clear to Mnuchin and Meadows that they were not supportive of Trump\u2019s insistence on a payroll tax cut or curbed funding for coronavirus tests and the CDC.\n\nRepublicans do appear to be gravitating toward a proposal on what to do about the expiring unemployment benefits, however. In March, Congress approved an additional $600 weekly benefit through the end of July for unemployed Americans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats have proposed extending those benefits through January, but the White House and some Republicans now want to cut the extra benefits to about $200 per week. Democrats haven\u2019t agreed to this, however.\n\nRepublicans were finding a harder time coming to a consensus on many other issues. Mnuchin on Monday had insisted the payroll tax idea was in the bill, but he didn\u2019t even bring it up during the lunch as the opposition snowballed, two people briefed on the interaction said.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t reached a conclusion on anything,\u201d Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) said when the lunch ended.\n\nMeadows acknowledged the discontent, telling reporters, \u201cWell as you can imagine, any time you have Senate Republicans there, you have a number of different thoughts on what should or should not happen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nUnderlying the confusion surrounding the GOP stimulus package are tensions among Trump administration officials about their priorities.\n\nTrump is being represented on Capitol Hill by Mnuchin and Meadows, a tandem that hasn\u2019t brokered a deal jointly with Congress before. Trump has for months privately worried that Mnuchin, his chief negotiator with Democrats, was giving away too much to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), leading conservative lawmakers to push for Meadows to have a more active role in this round of talks. Before joining the White House, Meadows was a congressman and leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Mnuchin, meanwhile, has a background as a banker and a Hollywood producer with few ties to the conservative movement.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, Meadows sat toward the back of the room and deferred to Mnuchin as he led the conversation with the GOP senators, according to two people aware of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. Mnuchin discussed the importance of sending another round of stimulus checks and providing more money for the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nAD\n\nMnuchin also told reporters it was important for lawmakers to reach an agreement before the supplemental increase in unemployment benefits runs out by the end of this month. Republican lawmakers, including Trump, have consistently bashed that benefit increase because they think it makes it more lucrative for workers to stay home than reenter the labor market, but Mnuchin stressed the importance of providing some financial cushion for the jobless.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to try to get something done before the enhanced unemployment insurance expires. There\u2019s a lot of people who are still out of work,\u201d Mnuchin said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters, though, that it was very unlikely a deal would be reached by the end of next week, laughing and saying no when asked whether that was possible.\n\nAD\n\nOne area the White House appeared to be shifting its position on was whether to include more money for coronavirus testing. Over the weekend, the White House had opposed new money for testing, but Senate Republicans pushed back. On Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said the administration would seek \u201ctargeted\u201d money for testing, saying that \u201cwe\u2019re willing to put in money for targeted testing that makes sense, not just dumping money into a pot that contains $10 billion.\u201d\n\nThese programs are just one part of what the administration and McConnell had envisioned as a $1 trillion package that is likely to be the last major coronavirus relief bill before the election. But the price tag appeared to be growing.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans have spent much of the past several days clashing over how to handle Trump\u2019s demand for a payroll tax cut plan. Mnuchin and Meadows were met with so much blowback to the idea at the Senate GOP lunch Tuesday that Mnuchin didn\u2019t try to persuade anyone to reconsider, several attendees said.\n\nAD\n\nHe was also confronted by multiple complaints about the size of the emerging package, with some lawmakers who had voted for the $2 trillion Cares Act in March saying they couldn\u2019t support the new package if it were to exceed $1 trillion.\n\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) argued against the payroll tax cut, making the case that no voters would notice the tax relief and that he was skeptical that the policy changes could even be implemented before October.\n\nAD\n\nElectoral politics were also in consideration at the lunch. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) urged other GOP senators to be attentive to what Republicans in competitive reelection bids are hearing on the ground from voters, and he made the case that if the GOP loses the majority, Democrats in control will implement policies that are much more costly to the national debt. So spending a bit more money now in a rescue bill that would aid Republicans in their races would be cheaper in the long run, he argued. Cotton is also up for reelection in November but is not considered to be in a competitive race.\n\nAD\n\nCotton\u2019s viewpoint appeared to clash with that of Cruz, who vigorously warned against spending too much money in the package and said it could lead to a revolt among conservative voters in November.\n\nCruz said the GOP should be focused on a safe restart of the economy. He said if the economy remains shuttered in November, Democrats will win both the White House and the Senate and that Republican senators, who usually meet in the ornate Mansfield Room in the Capitol, will \u201cbe meeting in a much smaller lunchroom\u201d next year.\n\nMcConnell did provide some details of what he hoped would be an eventual GOP package. He said it would include $105 billion to help schools reopen, another round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, more stimulus checks to individual Americans, incentives for hiring and retaining workers, and reimbursement for businesses to establish safety measures.\n\n\u201cThe American job market needs another shot of adrenaline,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cSenate Republicans are laser-focused on getting American workers their jobs back.\u201d\n\nTrump has already enacted four laws that provided close to $3 trillion in new tax cuts and spending to try to help the economy and health-care system navigate the coronavirus pandemic. The economy remains weak, however, with an unemployment rate of 11.1 percent and millions of people collecting unemployment benefits. Lawmakers are split over what to do next. When he was heading into a meeting with Senate appropriators, Meadows was asked about the highest price tag they could agree to.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/21/coronavirus-trump-congress-stimulus/?hpid=hp_hp-banner-main_bailouthill-935am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans", "author": ["Erica Werner", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On Economic Policy", "Jeff Stein", "Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter"]}, {"title": "Ocasio-Cortez accosted by GOP lawmaker over remarks: 'That kind of confrontation hasn't ever happened to me'", "text": "Tensions flared on Capitol Hill this week when a Republican lawmaker challenged Rep.

In addition to party delegates and high-ranking Democrats, the roll call vote will also be reported by \u201ca variety of voices,\u201d with examples including a DREAMer, a Teamster, and first responders.\n\nThe roll call vote will conclude with a \u201cbig celebratory moment,\u201d according to the deck, featuring a surprise musical act, fireworks, and \u201cpeople in their cars honking and flashing lights.\u201d\n\nReached for comment about the plans, Katie Peters, the communications director for the Democratic National Convention Committee told The Daily Beast that Democrats are \u201cexploring all options to host an inspiring event that unites the nation around Joe Biden's vision for America. Our plans are not yet confirmed and will continue to take shape over the next several weeks as we make adjustments to best protect public health.\u201d\n\nDespite the shortened broadcast time and remote-broadcast plan, the DNC is still making a major fundraising play for the slimmed-down convention, which has a budget of $20 million\u2014compared to the $86 million convention in Philadelphia four years ago.\n\nEven with its smaller pricetag, fundraising for a massive event that\u2019s nearly entirely digital has proved to be tricky for the DNC. During normal conventions, major donors can expect a plush suite near the center of the action, with exclusive events and opportunities to network with the likely leaders of the next administration. But the perks of cutting a major check to the Democratic National Convention Committee aren\u2019t in play this year\u2014rubbing shoulders being pretty much the opposite of social distancing\u2014and with one month until opening night, the DNCC is still seeking to raise north of $8 million for the convention, according to a Democratic donor who has been asked to kick in for the event.\n\nDespite the slashed budget and airtime, a few aspects of the convention will continue as they would in a normal election year. Each night of the convention features a generically patriotic theme\u2014\u201cA United America\u201d for the first night, \u201cA Future for All\u201d for the third night\u2014and the convention program still aims to highlight issues at the top of Democratic concerns, including racial justice, gun violence, health care, voting rights and the environment.\n\nBut the event will still be a jarring contrast to the business-as-usual\u2014albeit slimmed down\u2014Republican National Convention set to take place the following week in Jacksonville, Florida, which has local elected Republicans worried that the party\u2019s biggest f\u00eate of the election cycle will amount to a star-studded superspreader event.\n\nThe Democratic convention, meanwhile, will be broadcast for a mere two-to-three hours per night, rather than the usual six-hour speech-a-thon, with an emphasis on pre-recorded segments, which the DNC says in the deck will allow it \u201cto keep the message tight and integrated,\u201d more of a mini-movie than \u201ca series of long speeches.\u201d\n\nThe programming is currently set to be more candidate-centric than recent conventions, which typically hold back on emphasizing the nominee until the closing night. Potential moments for the convention, according to the deck, include clips of Biden throughout the years, with one \u201cframing clip\u201d intended to highlight the theme of the evening. There will be a total of five biographical videos about the former vice president, as well as pre-taped segments\u2014basically commercials\u2014featuring Biden \u201chaving intimate, unscripted, and potentially tough conversations\u201d with voters about the future of the country.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, meanwhile, will largely be relegated to interstitial \u201ccontrast\u201d videos, lest the convention turn into a four-night screed against the president. \u201cTime is better spent talking about what America \u2018can\u2019 be under the experienced and steady leadership\u201d of the former vice president, according to the DNC\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cWith the new \u2018virtual\u2019 format, viewers are unlikely to tune in night after night to hear Trump bashing,\u201d the deck declares.", "link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/leaked-documents-show-the-dncs-plans-for-a-reimagined-convention", "author": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"]}, {"title": "Clark County commissioners give approval for high-speed rail line to SoCal", "text": "Clark County commissioners give approval for high-speed rail line to SoCal\n\nCourtesy of XpressWest\n\nAn ambitious plan for a high-speed passenger train from Las Vegas to Southern California moved another step closer to reality today following a vote by Clark County commissioners.\n\nCommissioners voted unanimously to approve findings by the Nevada Department of Business and Industry related to financing for the proposed $5 billion rail line from Las Vegas to Victorville, Calif., a distance of about 190 miles.\n\nLast year, Virgin Trains USA applied to sell $200 million worth of tax-exempt private activity bonds through the state, money that would go toward the project.

We want to do everything possible to increase capacity,\u201d he said.\n\nVirgin Trains officials have said a trip from Las Vegas to Victorville by rail would probably take about 75 minutes.

There are more historic crises challenging his presidency than there are cable news channels, but that doesn\u2019t stop him tweeting about all the TV he\u2019s watching all day.\n\nFor a man who still measures his manhood by his own TV ratings, it was a curious choice to sit outside in the humid steamer of a Washington summer, caked in his glowing orange make-up, to field the pesky questions of the best interviewer on Fox News.\n\nPlay Video 1:55 Five strange moments from Trump's Fox News interview \u2013 video\n\n\u201cHot enough for you here, Mr President?\u201d asked Chris Wallace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s about, well, sort of almost record-breaking stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, we wanted to do it inside,\u201d replied Wallace. \u201cThis is your choice.\u201d\n\nTrump has made so many more consequential blunders than failing to prepare for his double-sided grilling by the weather and Wallace. But this chargrilled interview laid bare how the Wicked Wizard of the West Wing is melting before our eyes.\n\nThis chargrilled interview laid bare how the Wicked Wizard of the West Wing is melting before our eyes\n\nFor four years we have been told that populist leaders \u2013 especially this one \u2013 are peerless showmen: experts not in government but in hijacking the public attention.\n\nHis pithy nicknames and catchphrases supposedly destroyed his rivals in 2016. They came up with 12-point plans while he was going to make America great again. He threatened North Korea with his big nuclear button, then fell in love with the North Korean leader in a summit staged just for the cameras.\n\nBut now his repeated attempts to smear Joe Biden have flopped and the great showman is reportedly asking aides if he should try to find another nickname.\n\nWith every new poll showing him losing the election, both nationally and in all the battleground states, Trump\u2019s despair dribbled through all his pores on Sunday\u2019s interview.\n\nWhen asked if Biden was senile, Trump answered with the kind of half-baked half-thoughts of a mind cooking slowly in the heat of the presidency. \u201cI\u2019d say he\u2019s not competent to be president,\u201d he warmed up. \u201cTo be president, you have to be sharp and tough and so many other things.\u201d\n\nWhat are these so many other things, pray tell?\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even come out of his basement. They think, \u2018Oh this is a great campaign.\u2019 So he goes in.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear who they were or what he was going into. But it seemed totally clear to our sharp and tough president, who is also so many other things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll then make a speech. It\u2019ll be a great speech. And some young guy starts writing, \u2018Vice President Biden said this, this, this.\u2019 He didn\u2019t say it. Joe doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s alive, OK? He doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s alive.\u201d\n\nIt may be tempting to blame all of this on the young guy whose writing clearly leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nBut it\u2019s the old guy in the Oval we should be worried about. He doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s dying out there.\n\nThere have been some clues, of course. There was the disastrous riot of a photo op with a pretty bible and a ton of tear gas. There was the Tulsa rally for a million people who failed to show up. There was that weird Mount Rushmore speech about the fascists who say mean things about racists.\n\nThen again, as Chris Wallace pointed out, there are the polls that show this desperate act isn\u2019t working. And there\u2019s all the endless video of our sharp and tough president predicting the pandemic would just disappear, like a miracle, with a little disinfectant injected inside. Or perhaps some bright light.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right eventually,\u201d Trump insisted when confronted with his own cringe-inducing comments about the coronavirus. \u201cI will be right eventually. You know I said, \u2018It\u2019s going to disappear.\u2019 I\u2019ll say it again.\u201d\n\nThey say a stopped clock is right twice a day. But this broken timepiece will only be happy when all the clocks have stopped.\n\nAt this point in Trump\u2019s Twilight Zone, the audience has a good sense of the plot twists that lie ahead in the next four months. It consists of as much concocted chaos as humanly possible.\n\nThere will be terrorist protesters in every major city, whisked off the streets by Trump\u2019s paramilitaries in rented minivans. Thank goodness we have machine-gun-toting goons to protect us from all that graffiti.\n\nThere will be caravans of coronavirus-filled immigrants scaling the freshly-painted border wall, which has done such a fantastic job of protecting us all from the pandemic.\n\nAfter Nixon sweated his way to defeat against Kennedy, he returned to win the presidency eight years later with a law and order campaign that promised to shut down civil rights protests and stop enforcing civil rights laws.\n\nOur Trumpified version of Tricky Dick is a little less subtle than the original.\n\nHe claimed that people flying the confederate flag were \u201cnot talking about racism\u201d. But when asked about removing the names of confederate generals from US military bases, Trump could only think about race. And some weird stuff about a couple of world wars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to name it after the Rev Al Sharpton? What are you going to name it, Chris? Tell me what you\u2019re going to name it,\u201d Trump sputtered.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a whole thing here.

That has sparked debate over the use of federal power as local and state officials, and many in the community, condemn their tactics and demand they leave. Far from backing down, the administration plans to send agents to Chicago to respond to gun violence. And President Donald Trump says federal agents could be deployed elsewhere as he makes law and order a central element in his struggling re-election campaign.\n\nSome of the issues behind this unconventional, if not unprecedented, use of federal forces:\n\nWHAT\u2019S BEEN GOING ON IN PORTLAND?\n\nProtests over the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis have taken place in downtown Portland for more than 50 consecutive days, drawing at times more than 10,000 mostly peaceful demonstrators. A relatively small number of activists have vandalized downtown buildings, including the federal courthouse, and attacked police and federal agents.\n\nTrump issued an executive order June 26 to protect monuments and federal property after protesters tried to remove or destroy statues of people considered racist, including a failed attempt to pull down one of Andrew Jackson near the White House. The Department of Homeland Security dispatched agents to Portland as well as Seattle and Washington, D.C., starting around the Fourth of July weekend.\n\nWHY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY?\n\nDHS, which was formed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to improve the nation's response to the threat of international terrorism, oversees some of the largest U.S. law enforcement agencies. That includes the Border Patrol as well as Immigration Customs and Enforcement, which are seeing less of their usual activity because of COVID-19. DHS also oversees the Federal Protective Service, which guards federal buildings along with the U.S. Marshals Service. DHS sent members of the Border Patrol, along with Secret Service officers, Air Marshals and others, to Portland to protect the downtown courthouse complex.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED AFTER FEDERAL FORCES ARRIVED?\n\nFederal officers and protesters clashed in the streets outside the federal courthouse. Demonstrators broke windows and did other damage, hurled rocks at the officers and shined lasers in their eyes. Agents have fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators and arrested about 43 people since July 4, mostly for minor offenses. Tensions escalated after an officer with the Marshals Service fired a less-lethal round at a protester\u2019s head on July 11, critically injuring him. They ratcheted up further when agents in unmarked vehicles with generic \u201cpolice\u201d patches on their camouflage uniforms arrested people at night without identifying themselves.\n\nDHS officials defended the arrests Tuesday, saying they were carried out lawfully and intended to protect officers from violent crowds. They also noted it is routine to use unmarked vehicles. But it seemed to many like the U.S. had created a secret police force, and it drew lawsuits as well as more protesters into the streets.\n\nIS IT LEGAL FOR FEDERAL FORCES TO BE USED LIKE THIS?\n\nYes, to a certain extent. Federal authorities can enforce federal laws on federal property, like the courthouse in downtown Portland. But state and local officials say the federal agents have operated beyond their jurisdiction, and that has raised constitutional issues now being challenged in court. As Michael Dorf, a professional of constitutional law at Cornell University, told The Associated Press, \u201cThe idea that there\u2019s a threat to a federal courthouse and the federal authorities are going to swoop in and do whatever they want to do without any cooperation and coordination with state and local authorities is extraordinary outside the context of a civil war.\"\n\nEVEN IF IT\u2019S LEGAL, IS IT A GOOD IDEA?\n\nDHS has assisted with local enforcement before, but not without consent. It sent agents to Puerto Rico to help confront a spike in crime linked to drug trafficking in 2013 and dispatched the Border Patrol's tactical team to track two escaped convicts in rural upstate New York in 2015. But as John Cohen, a former senior DHS official under Obama and President George W. Bush, noted, those were conducted in close cooperation with state and local authorities. Employing DHS on its own, in a mission that seems to be suspiciously aligned with the president's reelection campaign, appears to be unprecedented. \u201cIf the public begins to perceive that they are being partisan in how they operate they lose credibility, and if they lose credibility, they lose public trust,\u201d said Cohen, who now teaches at Georgetown University.\n\nWHAT CAN BE EXPECTED TO HAPPEN NEXT?\n\nThe Oregon attorney general filed a lawsuit Friday arguing that the federal government had violated the rights of citizens of the state by detaining people without probable cause. The American Civil Liberties Union has also sued, seeking to stop the federal government's use of rubber bullets, tear gas and acoustic weapons against journalists and other legal observers. These and other legal actions could force the federal agents to change tactics or perhaps downsize their mission in the city.\n\nActing DHS Secretary Chad Wolf at a news conference Tuesday urged state and local authorities in Portland to work with the federal government to stop the violence directed at federal personnel and property. He also sought to draw a sharp distinction between people demonstrating against police brutality and those attacking the courthouse. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to peacefully protest in Portland, the department respects your right to do so,\u201d he said.", "link": "https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/heavily-armed-us-agents-on-city-streets/507-2e8e462b-d2ea-4e77-8f1e-03c5e3547cfc", "author": []}, {"title": "Duckworth slams 'disgusting' Trump threat to send federal law enforcement to Chicago: 'Don't even think about it'", "text": "Sen.

Engel, director of Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s latest plan, yet to be publicly announced, about 150 Homeland Security Investigations agents would go to Chicago to help local law enforcement deal with a spike in crime, according to an official with direct knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThose agents, who are generally used to investigate human trafficking, drugs and weapons smuggling, are expected to stay in Chicago at least two months, according to the official. It\u2019s not clear exactly when they would arrive or how their mission would play out, but they would work under the Justice Department.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said no one had been sent to Chicago yet. She added, \u201cThe bottom line is that this president stands with law and order, which leads to peace.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet Sunday, Trump blamed local leaders for a growing spate of violence in cities like Chicago that has left dozens dead, including young children. He added a dire warning that \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats, who totally control Biden, will destroy our Country as we know it,\u201d referring to Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nTrump has also intervened in other cities, including Washington, D.C. In the protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Trump deployed U.S. National Guard troops and federal law enforcement officials from agencies including U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Drug Enforcement Administration to patrol the city.\n\nThe show of force came to a head when federal authorities in riot gear dispersed crowds from Lafayette Square across from the White House, where the president then posed with a Bible in front of a church.\n\nThe Chicago plan appears to be an extension of a separate operation in which the administration sent more than 100 federal law enforcement officers to Kansas City, Missouri, to help quell a record rise in violence after the shooting death of a young boy there. The Justice Department doesn\u2019t have the manpower to surge agents to high-crime areas, so it is borrowing from Homeland Security.\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot was at first highly resistant, but her tone changed after she and members of her administration, along with Police Superintendent David Brown, talked with officials about the government\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very clear that we welcome actual partnership,\u201d Lightfoot said. \u201cBut we do not welcome dictatorship. We do not welcome authoritarianism, and we do not welcome unconstitutional arrest and detainment of our residents. That is something I will not tolerate.\u201d\n\nThe comments from Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, slightly deescalated a days-long war of words with Trump over violent crime in the city, which has seen 414 homicides this year, compared with 275 during the same period in 2019.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump has leaned on Homeland Security to carry out his political objectives, including cracking down on illegal immigration and slowing legal immigration applications. The 240,000-person agency manages border security as well as natural disasters and the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nBut with the border largely shuttered because of the coronavirus and the number of illegal crossings plummeting, Trump is now using the department to combat crime and demonstrations demanding justice and racial equality.\n\nWhile the protests have largely been peaceful, Trump and his allies in conservative media have portrayed the cities as out of control as he tries to contrast himself with Biden and make the case to voters \u2014 especially the suburban women who turned against Republicans in the 2018 midterms \u2014 that failing to elect him for a second term will lead to lawlessness.\n\nCritics say the federal forces have stoked tensions, creating new images of violence that could lead frightened viewers to vote for Trump.\n\nHomeland Security first jumped into the federal response to the Floyd protests in May as some demonstrations erupted into sporadic violence around the country. But effort shifted into high gear over the July Fourth weekend as Homeland Security agents and officers from at least a half a dozen components of the sprawling organization were arriving in Portland.\n\nProtesters there have been staging nightly demonstrations since May in a section of downtown that includes the federal courthouse, forcing most businesses in the zone to close.\n\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said federal personnel have been assaulted with lasers, bats, fireworks, bottles and other weapons and \u201cyet the city of Portland takes little to no action.\u201d Wolf said the people committing the vandalism should not be considered legitimate protesters.\n\nBut former Homeland Security officials say they\u2019ve seen nothing like the Portland deployment, which has included using highly trained Border Patrol agents to confront protesters outside the downtown courthouse, without the cooperation or consent of local law enforcement or government officials.\n\n\u201cUrban policing and crowd control and civil unrest isn\u2019t something that is in their wheelhouse,\u201d said Gil Kerlikowske, a former commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection under President Barack Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s not something they are trained for. It\u2019s not something they have any experience or expertise in.\u201d\n\nArrests made by federal officers over the July Fourth weekend and several days after were for relatively minor offenses not typically prosecuted in federal court, including misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct. Officials have accused some demonstrators of assaulting federal officers, by shining lasers in their eyes or other means, and said at least one person was detained with the ingredients for a pipe bomb.\n\nJohn Cohen, a former senior DHS official under Obama and President George W. Bush, said such a high-profile presence of federal agents without local support created the risk of escalating the situation, and that appears to be what happened.\n\nThe protests have grown in recent days, particularly after federal officers in unmarked vans and with generic \u201cpolice\u201d patches last week detained several people on downtown streets without identifying themselves \u2014 a move some critics have compared to kidnappings.\n\n\u201cIf the public begins to perceive that they are being partisan in how they operate, they lose credibility, and if they lose credibility, they lose public trust,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cAnd for a security or law enforcement organization, the loss of public trust can be fatal.\u201d\n\nDavid Lapan, a retired Marine colonel who served as Homeland Security press secretary as well as a public affairs officer for the Defense Department, said he worried about a blurring line between military and law enforcement that \u201ccreates the impression the military is being used to suppress the public.\u201d\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\u00ab Previous\n\nNext \u00bb\n\nfiled under:", "link": "https://www.pressherald.com/2020/07/21/trump-to-send-federal-agents-to-chicago-maybe-other-cities-run-by-democrats/", "author": ["Email Writer"]}, {"title": "New York, Chicago vow court action if Trump sends in federal agents", "text": "US federal law enforcement officers, deployed under the Trump administration's new executive order to protect federal monuments and buildings, face off with protesters against racial inequality and police violence in Portland, Oregon, on July 21, 2020.\n\nThe mayors of New York City and Chicago said on Tuesday they would take President Donald Trump to court if he sent unidentified U.S. government agents to police their cities, pushing back on a threat that has sparked widespread controversy over the use of federal force.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nBut Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also said she would accept an influx of FBI agents and other identified law enforcement officials from the Trump administration, an acknowledgement of the scale of gun violence and other crimes plaguing her city.\n\nLightfoot and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke a day after Trump said he would send law enforcement to several cities including Baltimore, Chicago, New York and Philadelphia to crack down on protests against racism and police brutality ignited by George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.\n\nA Republican, Trump made a point of saying the mayors of the cities on his list were liberal Democrats, underpinning concerns the threat was politically motivated. Federal agents last week were dispatched to counter protests in Portland, Oregon, where protesters have complained of agents making arrests without identifying themselves and using unmarked rental cars.\n\nOpinion polls show Trump trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the run-up to a Nov. 3 presidential election. Trump has sought to make a crackdown a campaign issue, taking the spotlight off his response to the coronavirus pandemic, a weak point for him in the polls.\n\nDe Blasio said Trump's threat was likely bluster, but added that he would challenge any deployment in the courts. He said the actions of unidentified officers grabbing citizens in Portland \"appeared to violate basic constitutional rights.\"\n\n\"This president blusters and bluffs and says he's going to do things and they never materialize on a regular basis, so we should not overrate his statements, they are so often not true.\"\n\nLightfoot said on Tuesday that she had been told that no unidentified officers would be deployed. The Chicago Tribune had reported on Monday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the forces in Portland, would deploy 150 agents to help tamp down violence in the city.\n\n\"Unfortunately there's been a lot of saber rattling about that coming from the president and members of his team,\" Lightfoot told reporters. \"What I understand at this point, and I caveat that, is that the Trump administration is not going to actually deploy unnamed agents in the streets of Chicago.\"\n\nInstead, Lightfoot said reinforcements would come from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and \"plug into\" federal agencies already coordinating with the city on crime.\n\n50 nights of protest\n\nThe Portland protests have gone on for more than 50 nights. On Monday, video showed federal agents firing tear gas, protesters pulling down fencing around the federal courthouse, and hundreds of people dressed in yellow who said they were mothers and fathers demanding the agents withdraw.\n\nDHS has placed about 2,000 officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other agencies on standby for possible deployment to cities, the New York Times reported.\n\nA CBP official told Reuters that officers from three border units in paramilitary-type operations had been deployed to Portland. It was unclear whether officers had been deployed to other cities.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told a briefing on Tuesday that dispatching agents was justified by a federal statute empowering the secretary of Homeland Security to deputize agents to protect federal property and people on that property.\n\nAt a separate briefing, acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf said his agents were properly identifying themselves in Portland. \"We are only targeting and arresting those who have been identified as committing crime,\" Wolf said.\n\nHowever, legal experts said there were limits to Trump's power and that he could be challenged in court. \"The president is not the king,\" said Kent Greenfield, a Boston College law professor.\n\nOregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum sued the Department of Homeland Security last week and asked a federal judge to grant a temporary order blocking its officers from what she called unlawful detentions that lacked probable cause.\n\nPhiladelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said he would criminally charge any federal agents who arrested citizens without probable cause or restrained them unlawfully. He said he saw potential crimes by agents in video footage from Portland.\n\nBut Krasner said he was skeptical that Trump would actually send agents to Philadelphia. He said the city's protests had been peaceful. \"Let us not take these fluffy words and act like they are more than they really are,\" he said. \"It's really just bluster.\"\n\n(REUTERS)\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe", "link": "https://www.france24.com/en/20200722-new-york-chicago-vow-court-action-if-trump-sends-in-federal-agents", "author": ["News Wires"]}, {"title": "Ocasio-Cortez accosted by GOP lawmaker over remarks: 'That kind of confrontation hasn't ever happened to me'", "text": "Tensions flared on Capitol Hill this week when a Republican lawmaker challenged Rep.

At the same time, he was the subject of a recent IRS criminal complaint, as well as an ongoing high-profile defamation lawsuit, also filed against the network in a New York federal court.\n\nThe latest suit did not deter Carlson from returning to the air Monday. In his first show since the pre-planned interregnum, Carlson attacked The New York Times for allegedly preparing to publish a story which would reveal the location of his house. Carlson suggested that the move would endanger the lives of his wife and children.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe harassment allegations against Carlson stem from a December 2018 installment of \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d featuring Cathy Areu, then a frequent guest of the program.\n\nAt the end of Areu\u2019s segment, an unnamed producer or writer whispered in her ear to stay put until the program was off air, according to the complaint. She claimed that no one in the crew would disconnect her microphone and earpiece on set, making it impossible for her to leave.\n\nWhen the show wrapped, Carlson allegedly invited Areu to his hotel room, specifying that his wife would not be present. Areu claimed that Carlson cut her appearances when she refused, featuring her three times in 2019 and zero times in 2020.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA producer said the Fox News host personally reviewed and rejected proposals to have Areu on his show despite the fact that her segments were among the most popular, per the filing.\n\nThe suit\u2019s most graphic allegations come from Eckhart, a former associate producer at Fox Business, who accused Henry, the former co-anchor of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\u201d of rape and other forms of sexual violence. Areu also filed sexual harassment claims against Henry, as well as Hannity and the \u201cMedia Buzz\u201d host Howard Kurtz.

A message to Eckhart referenced \u201cowned & submissive\u201d anal sex, according to the filing. Others said, \u201cF**k you and your safe word.

Areu singled Carlson out for allegations of sexual harassment and retaliation.\n\nMichael J. Willemin, an attorney who along with veteran sexual misconduct litigator Doug Wigdor represents the two women, told Salon that their team informed the network about the details surrounding Areu's allegations July 9, which a Fox News spokesperson confirmed to Salon in an email.\n\nThe spokesperson said the network \"promptly investigated\" the claims upon learning about them.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\"Tucker is still employed, and this has zero to do with his vacation, which was legit and pre-planned,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nCarlson made the announcement on his first show after the network was informed of the pending lawsuit. At the same time, Willemin claimed that the network had already known for two weeks that he and Wigdor were representing the women.\n\nThe news raises more questions about the timing of Carlson's short break, which also came amid an onslaught of criticism after network rival CNN revealed that the show's longtime top writer had secretly posted racist and vile comments on the internet for years.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nCarlson, who once took a vacation when advertisers began cutting ties with his show after he called white supremacy a \"hoax,\" had in the prior days and weeks escalated his own race-baiting rhetoric again. He was accused of \"hate speech\" after appearing to echo the infamous white supremacist \"14 words\" slogan: \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\"\n\nFollowing the host's original July 13 announcement, Salon took up an intrepid investigation into other Fox News personalities who have taken conspicuously timed \"vacations\" over the years.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nCarlson has, in some senses, been riding high after returning in the highest cable news ratings in history the previous month and drawing speculation about a possible presidential run. At the same time, he was the subject of a recent IRS criminal complaint, as well as an ongoing high-profile defamation lawsuit, also filed against the network in a New York federal court.\n\nThe latest suit did not deter Carlson from returning to the air Monday. In his first show since the pre-planned interregnum, Carlson attacked The New York Times for allegedly preparing to publish a story which would reveal the location of his house. Carlson suggested that the move would endanger the lives of his wife and children.\n\nThe harassment allegations against Carlson stem from a December 2018 installment of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" featuring Cathy Areu, then a frequent guest of the program.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAt the end of Areu's segment, an unnamed producer or writer whispered in her ear to stay put until the program was off air, according to the complaint. She claimed that no one in the crew would disconnect her microphone and earpiece on set, making it impossible for her to leave.\n\nWhen the show wrapped, Carlson allegedly invited Areu to his hotel room, specifying that his wife would not be present. Areu claimed that Carlson cut her appearances when she refused, featuring her three times in 2019 and zero times in 2020.\n\nA producer said the Fox News host personally reviewed and rejected proposals to have Areu on his show despite the fact that her segments were among the most popular, per the filing.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe suit's most graphic allegations come from Eckhart, a former associate producer at Fox Business, who accused Henry, the former co-anchor of \"America's Newsroom,\" of rape and other forms of sexual violence. Areu also filed sexual harassment claims against Henry, as well as Hannity and the \"Media Buzz\" host Howard Kurtz. The four men have also been sued in their individual capacities.\n\nThe legal complaint was itself so graphic in nature that it included a trigger warning: \"This document contains contains highly-graphic information of a sexual nature, including sexual assault.\" It goes on to detail Henry's alleged attempts to groom Eckhart, who claims she was asked to be his \"little whore\" and \"sex slave.\" Henry allegedly threatened Eckhart with punishment and retaliation if she did not comply with his demands.\n\nEckhart alleged that she was ultimately \"violently raped while helpless and restrained in metal handcuffs\" as Henry \"performed sadistic acts on her without her consent that left her injured, bruised and battered with bloody wrists.\"\n\nThe suit claimed that Henry had earlier forced Eckhart to perform oral sex on him \u2014 on network property \u2014 before raping her at a hotel where Fox often hosted visiting employees, \"thereby facilitating, whether knowingly or unknowingly, Mr. Henry's conduct.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHenry also allegedly sent both Eckhart and Areu lewd and abusive text messages. A message to Eckhart referenced \"owned & submissive\" anal sex, according to the filing. Others said, \"F**k you and your safe word. You will know when I am done,\" and \"When u r owned u don't get a 'choice.'\"\n\nYet another text to Eckhart allegedly read, \"Good long session last time left you bruised battered dazed sated begging for more.\" He appended the tweet with the hashtag \"#perfect.\"\n\nHenry allegedly abused Areu with \"a slew of wildly inappropriate sexual images and messages\" for several months this year, according to the court document. The texts, which Areu allegedly retains, include \"a 'closeup' photograph of a woman's vagina being 'clamped' closed by four clothespins\" and a video titled \"Fastest Interview ... candidate selected in 3 seconds.\"\n\nAccording to the complaint, the video featured a woman job candidate exposing her vagina to the interviewer, who then selected her for the job. Immediately after Henry sent the video, he allegedly texted Areu: \"Are you avail for anchor interview.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nNetwork executives allegedly knew about Henry's misconduct as far back as early 2017. The suit named Fox News Executive Vice President of Human Resources Kevin Lord, Fox News President and Executive Editor Jay Wallace and Fox Business President Lauren Petterson.\n\nA Fox News spokesperson disputed the suggestion. \"There were not sexual harassment claims against Ed Henry at FOX News prior to Jennifer Eckhart's claim on June 25, 2020,\" the spokesperson said in an email.\n\nThe filing alleged that the network did not take substantive disciplinary action against Henry, but instead rewarded him with a promotion to co-anchor on \"America's Newsroom,\" as well as a streaming show on Fox Nation.

The Wigdor firm declined, the spokesperson said, saying that the women would not sit for an interview \"unless investigators promised that anything either plaintiff said could not be used in any future litigation or proceeding.\" The network found those demands unreasonable, the spokesperson said, because \"evidence cannot be suppressed or hidden in this manner in litigation.\"\n\n\"Fox News would have the public believe that it is a different place from the Fox News that was run by former disgraced Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes,\" the complaint's first paragraph read. \"Unfortunately, it is actually worse.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2018, just before former network host Shep Smith departed on his own vacation amid a squabble with the network's primetime lineup, he told colleague Chris Wallace during on-air banter that everything would be \"peachy-keen\" on his return.\n\n\"Going to take a one-week vacation that was previously planned, and be back in a week, and everything will be peachy-keen and hunky-dory,\" Smith said. \"I can't wait.\"\n\n\"That's what they always say: Previously planned and one-week vacation,\" Wallace replied.\n\nSmith eventually departed the network in 2019 after a public dust-up with Carlson.

This is all part of a broader left-wing effort to erode the rights of Americans citizens, and I will not stand for it.\"\n\nRep. Tony C\u00e1rdenas (D-Calif.), head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's campaign arm, called Trump a racist and said the order is a distraction.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s strategy to scare immigrants from taking part in the Census is unlawful; it will not stand in the courts and he knows it. This executive order is the action of a racist, misguided, and troubled president who continues to make unconstitutional attacks on hard-working immigrants in this country to distract from his failure as a leader,\" said C\u00e1rdenas.\n\nIt's unclear how the Trump administration would discern each respondent's citizenship or immigration status as there is no citizenship question included in the 2020 census. The president last year directed federal agencies to collect and submit data to the Commerce Department on citizens and noncitizens in the United States and signaled that information would be used to help determine the census count.\n\n\"If they use questionable social science data techniques you're likely to have additional legal challenges,\" said Michael Kagan, director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Kagan pointed out that the use of sampling and other social science methods to reinforce Census numbers was struck down by the Supreme Court in a landmark 1999 case.\n\nTrump in an executive order last year, following the Supreme Court's ruling on the citizenship question, ordered federal agencies to share all available information with the Commerce Department \u2013 which runs the Census \u2013 to discern which respondents are legally in the country and which are not.\n\nThat order specifically mentions the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its files of visa and green card holders as well as naturalizations, entry and exit records; the State Department's passport and refugee records; and the records of social services like Medicaid and the Social Security Administration.\n\n\"The Census Bureau has been collecting records from departments and agencies. Those records should provide a basis for identifying illegal aliens,\" a White House official told The Hill.\n\nTuesday's order drew swift reactions from other lawmakers and advocacy groups that, amid the coronavirus pandemic, were already concerned about minority groups being undercounted in the census and consequently affecting the apportionment of representation and resources for years to come.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution requires that everyone in the U.S. be counted in the census. President Trump can\u2019t pick and choose,\" Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Voting Rights Project, said in a statement. \"\n\n\"He tried to add a citizenship question to the census and lost in the Supreme Court,\" Ho continued. \"His latest attempt to weaponize the census for an attack on immigrant communities will be found unconstitutional. We\u2019ll see him in court, and win, again.\u201d\n\nRep. Gil Cisneros Gilbert (Gil) Ray CisnerosMORE (D-Calif.) said Trump's order is an attempt to depress minority participation in the Census.\n\n\u201cInstead of working to stop the spread of the coronavirus, President Trump is putting his energy into undermining the U.S. Census. This executive order is another blatant, backward attempt to depress the number of individuals who could participate in constitutionally-mandated population count. After the Supreme Court blocked him from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, the President is trying to unlawfully sidestep their ruling,\u201d said Cisneros.\n\nThe Trump administration previously attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, but Trump dropped the bid to do so after the Supreme Court decision, which said the administration's reasoning was \"contrived.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Commerce Department later said it would print the census materials without the question. The result was a victory for immigration groups and Democrats who argued including the question would discourage undocumented people from filling out the census and lead to an inaccurate population count.\n\nThis approach differs from the citizenship question in that it openly seeks to bar a particular group from being counted in the census.\n\nDuring debate on the citizenship question, Trump administration officials vehemently denied accusations that it was intended to discourage participation by foreign nationals, despite accusations to that effect from its opponents.\n\n\"It's a direct focused attack on political power. It would be reducing the political representation of America's most diverse states,\" said Kagan, one of the litigators in the case that blocked the citizenship question.\n\nThe new policy takes aim solely at the Census's apportionment effects, but ignores its budgetary effects \u2014 funding from federal programs is in large part assigned according to Census data.\n\nIf undocumented immigrants were successfully excluded from the census, California \u2014 with its more than 2 million undocumented residents \u2014 would bear the brunt of representational effects.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut red states like Texas and Georgia \u2014 home to 1.6 million and 400,000 undocumented residents, respectively \u2014 would also be hard-hit, potentially losing seats in Congress.\n\nSome administration allies cheered the move. Dan Stein, head of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates for restricting legal and illegal immigration, called the memo \"an honest attempt\" to ensure every citizen and legal immigrant receives \"full and fair representation.\"\n\nThe order is the first in what is expected to be a string of unilateral actions by Trump in the coming weeks.

MORE teased earlier this month that Trump was preparing orders related to immigration, manufacturing and other issues, though he would not elaborate.\n\nTrump has said he is readying an order that would emphasize merit-based immigration, but he has fueled confusion by suggesting the action would also address the Dreamers protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as well. White House aides have disputed that DACA will be covered by the executive order.\n\nThe administration is widely expected to try for a second time to rescind DACA after the Supreme Court rejected its first attempt but did not dispute the president's right to end the program.\n\n\u2014Updated at 3:55 p.m.", "link": "https://thehill.com/latino/508314-trump-aims-to-bar-undocumented-immigrants-from-counting-toward-house-representation", "author": []}, {"title": "The Protesters Are the True Patriots", "text": "Ted Eytan/Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt is truly bizarre that, at a moment when the Trump administration is sending in federal stormtroopers to threaten peaceful protesters in Portland, Oregon, conservatives are claiming that it is liberals who threaten the foundation of our democratic republic. It all started with Trump\u2019s speech at Mt. Rushmore on July 4th.\n\nSeventeen seventy-six represented the culmination of thousands of years of western civilization and the triumph not only of spirit, but of wisdom, philosophy, and reason. And yet, as we meet here tonight, there is a growing danger that threatens every blessing our ancestors fought so hard for, struggled, they bled to secure. Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children\u2026 This attack on our liberty, our magnificent liberty, must be stopped, and it will be stopped very quickly. We will expose this dangerous movement, protect our nation\u2019s children, end this radical assault, and preserve our beloved American way of life\u2026 Make no mistake: this left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution.\n\nThat was followed up by a speech from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the National Constitution Center to unveil the first report from his \u201cCommission on Unalienable Rights.\u201d The secretary had established the commission a year ago in order to ground our foreign policy in this country\u2019s founding ideals. The first thing to note is that Pompeo thinks that it is necessary to prioritize which unalienable rights are most important.\n\n\u2026the report emphasizes foremost among these rights are property rights and religious liberty. No one can enjoy the pursuit of happiness if you cannot own the fruits of your own labor, and no society \u2013 no society can retain its legitimacy or a virtuous character without religious freedom.\n\nOf course, what a Christian nationalist like Pompeo means when he talks about \u201creligious liberty\u201d is the freedom of white evangelical Christians to do what they please and all other religions be damned. That one has a lot of human rights advocates pointing out that it is the rights of women and LGBTQ persons to be treated as equal citizens under the law that are getting thrown under the bus.\n\nPompeo mentioned Trump\u2019s speech at Mt. Rushmore when he launched into his own attack on those who are protesting against police brutality.\n\nPresident Trump spoke about this at Mount Rushmore on the Fourth of July. And our rights tradition is under assault. The New York Times\u2019s 1619 Project \u2013 so named for the year that the first slaves were transported to America \u2013 wants you to believe that our country was founded for human bondage. They want you to believe that America\u2019s institutions continue to reflect the country\u2019s acceptance of slavery at our founding. They want you to believe that Marxist ideology that America is only the oppressors and the oppressed. The Chinese Communist Party must be gleeful when they see the New York Times spout this ideology. Some people have taken these false doctrines to heart. The rioters pulling down statues thus see nothing wrong with desecrating monuments to those who fought for our unalienable rights \u2013 from our founding to the present day. This is a dark vision of America\u2019s birth. I reject it. It\u2019s a disturbed reading of history. It is a slander on our great people. Nothing could be further from the truth of our founding and the rights about which this report speaks. The commission reminds us \u2013 it\u2019s got a quote from Frederick Douglas, himself a freed slave, who saw the Constitution as a \u201cglorious, liberty document.\u201d That it is.\n\nThat quote from Frederick Douglass is a favorite among conservatives. What they don\u2019t tell you is that it comes from his speech titled, \u201cWhat to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\u2019 given in 1852\u2014nine years before the Civil War. Speaking to a white audience, Douglass refers to \u201cyour National Independence, and of your political freedom\u201d (emphasis mine), making it clear that it doesn\u2019t apply to those who were enslaved. You can almost see the tongue-in-cheek way that he talks about what led up to the Declaration of Independence from British rule.\n\nFeeling themselves harshly and unjustly treated by the home government, your fathers, like men of honesty, and men of spirit, earnestly sought redress. They petitioned and remonstrated; they did so in a decorous, respectful, and loyal manner. Their conduct was wholly unexceptionable. This, however, did not answer the purpose. They saw themselves treated with sovereign indifference, coldness and scorn. Yet they persevered. They were not the men to look back\u2026 Oppression makes a wise man mad. Your fathers were wise men, and if they did not go mad, they became restive under this treatment. They felt themselves the victims of grievous wrongs, wholly incurable in their colonial capacity. With brave men there is always a remedy for oppression. Just here, the idea of a total separation of the colonies from the crown was born! It was a startling idea, much more so, than we, at this distance of time, regard it. The timid and the prudent (as has been intimated) of that day, were, of course, shocked and alarmed by it.\n\nIt seems pretty clear that Pompeo has never read Douglass\u2019s whole speech. So it might surprise him to learn that the man he quoted referred to our founding fathers as oppressed, but wise men who chaffed under their treatment by the home government. The Declaration of Independence was actually a protest document.\n\nBut by the end of his speech, Douglass made it clear that these founding ideals were not extended to people like him.\n\nI say it with a sad sense of the disparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this glorious anniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us. The blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. \u2014 The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth [of] July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn.\n\nThat is the part of Douglass\u2019s speech that Pompeo doesn\u2019t want you to hear\u2014much less read himself. There are people who are still mourning the fact that American hasn\u2019t lived up to its ideals. They are taking to the streets to protest and this administration is doing everything in their power to vilify, threaten, and stop them.\n\nIt is worth noting that it was this country\u2019s first African American president who drew our attention to the words contained in the preamble to the Constitution during his 2008 speech about race in America (emphasis mine).\n\nWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\n\nHere\u2019s what Obama said.\n\nOf course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution \u2014 a Constitution that had at its very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty and justice and a union that could be and should be perfected over time. And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part \u2014 through protests and struggles, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience, and always at great risk \u2014 to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time.\n\nWith the passing of John Lewis over the weekend, this is also a time to remember the words Obama spoke to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the march he led across the bridge in Selma, Alabama.\n\nAs we commemorate their achievement, we are well-served to remember that at the time of the marches, many in power condemned rather than praised them. Back then, they were called Communists, or half-breeds, or outside agitators, sexual and moral degenerates, and worse \u2013- they were called everything but the name their parents gave them. Their faith was questioned. Their lives were threatened. Their patriotism challenged. And yet, what could be more American than what happened in this place? What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people \u2013- unsung, the downtrodden, the dreamers not of high station, not born to wealth or privilege, not of one religious tradition but many, coming together to shape their country\u2019s course? What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this, what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals? That\u2019s why Selma is not some outlier in the American experience. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not a museum or a static monument to behold from a distance. It is instead the manifestation of a creed written into our founding documents: \u201cWe the People\u2026 in order to form a more perfect union.\u201d \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\u201d\n\nIt is people like Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo who are in the process of threatening the ideals on which this country was founded. They are the ones who are calling protesters \u201ceverything but the name their parents gave them\u201d and serving up the modern-day equivalent of the billy clubs used against people like John Lewis on \u201cBloody Sunday.\u201d\n\nThe great divide in this country has always been the one between those in power who will do anything to maintain the status quo and those who revere our founding ideals enough to join the struggle to perfect our union.

Trump\u2019s previous turn at the lectern included several attempts to tout unproven treatments for the virus, ranging from hydroxychloroquine to disinfectant and light.\n\nHe regularly got into tiffs with reporters who pointed out shortcomings in his administration\u2019s response \u2014 once storming out of the Rose Garden after being challenged by two journalists.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile some Republicans criticized the briefings in March and April as unfocused and unhelpful, others welcomed the news Monday that the president would be publicly returning his attention to the pandemic, which now sits atop the list of issues most pressing to voters. Trump\u2019s efforts to ignore and play down the virus in recent weeks have irked Republican lawmakers and governors \u2014 some of whom have publicly criticized him for not doing more to lead the country during a crisis.\n\nEven some of Trump\u2019s aides publicly called on him to begin playing a more central role in the national response to the virus, which has infected more than 3.8 million Americans, killing more than 138,000. Trump, who called himself a \u201cwartime president\u201d during a White House briefing in March, tried to move on rhetorically from the crisis by declaring a \u201ctransition to greatness\u201d in May and drastically reducing his mentions of the virus even as it spread at a record pace in recent weeks.\n\nAfter mentioning the virus more than 812 times in March and April, Trump did so only 278 times in May and June, according to Factba.se, a data analytics firm that tracks the president\u2019s comments and tweets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just think the people want to hear from the president of the United States,\u201d White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters on Friday. She told Fox News earlier Friday that some of her White House colleagues did not want Trump to return to the briefing room \u2014 confirming publicly the kind of internal dissension previous administrations would have tried to keep out of the public domain.\n\nVice President Pence has advocated for briefings to return for several weeks, thinking they were helpful to the administration and informative, according to two administration officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Some administration officials were opposed to the briefings, and others, including communications director Alyssa Farah and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, have called for briefings to take place at the Department of Health and Human Services or elsewhere \u2014 with health experts and a health-focused press corps, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nAmong the allies urging Trump to do more about the virus is Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who golfed with the president on Saturday and Sunday. Graham said Trump was going to be \u201cmore involved\u201d on the virus, and he counseled him to hold events in the Cabinet Room or Roosevelt Room with business leaders, or others, while taking a few questions at the end.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cArguing with a reporter for 30 minutes doesn\u2019t help,\u201d \u00adGraham said, adding that the original format was at times counterproductive.\n\nThe president, Graham said, wants to talk about a potential vaccine and some improvements in personal protective equipment, along with what the country is doing about testing and his animus toward China.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see him very focused on the coronavirus,\u201d Graham said, adding that Trump is very angry with China.\n\nSeveral White House officials said the administration had to talk more about the virus because Trump\u2019s poll numbers have fallen significantly in recent weeks.\n\nThere has been a net drop of 28 points in his approval margin on the virus since March, according to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll. Currently, 38 percent approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic, and 60 percent disapprove. Trump trails his Democratic rival Joe Biden 55 percent to 40 percent among registered voters in the poll, the latest to show a double-digit gap.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDo you think what we\u2019re doing right now is working?\u201d one official said, when asked whether the briefings would improve the president\u2019s standing.\n\nOfficials are hoping to prep the president for shorter briefings.\n\nMany of the briefings are likely to feature just the president \u2014 a departure from previous events where public health officials also appeared, administration officials said.\n\n\u201cThe plan is for them to be the president and to keep them short and tight,\u201d a senior administration official said, adding that Trump could appear multiple times per week.\n\nAfter the president\u2019s last set of briefings, advisers pleaded with him to stop or cut back, citing his plummeting poll numbers. Among those advisers: Ronna McDaniel, Jared Kushner and former campaign manager Brad Parscale. After Trump\u2019s final briefing, in which he suggested that disinfectant could be used internally to kill the virus, he relented.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut in recent days, some of his political advisers have argued that he has to focus more on the virus, with record high caseloads reported almost daily. The president has finally been persuaded, advisers said, to talk more about the crisis.\n\nThere was relief among the president\u2019s advisers when he agreed to wear a mask for a visit this month to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and advisers quickly praised him and posted images publicly on their social media feeds.\n\nTrump, who used previous briefings to contradict health experts and play down the importance of wearing masks, sought to change course Monday \u2014 tweeting a picture of himself with his face covered.\n\nAD\n\nCalling himself \u201cyour favorite President,\u201d Trump wrote that \u201cmany people say that it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can\u2019t socially distance.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s critics have argued that the president has already shown that he cannot be trusted to responsibly command the country\u2019s attention during the crisis. Some have pushed for television networks not to air the briefings, which have at times run for two hours and veered into a tangle of subjects unrelated to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve watched this exact scene from Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing horror movie before when he hijacked the briefings and spread dangerous misinformation, including advising Americans who get COVID-19 to inject themselves with disinfectant \u2014 drowning out the same public health experts who he\u2019s now outright attacking,\u201d Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden, said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign has tried to draw a contrast between the president\u2019s front-and-center approach and Biden\u2019s more low-key campaign, which has attempted to follow health guidelines by avoiding unnecessary gatherings.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmericans can see that President Trump has been out front and leading the country through the coronavirus crisis,\u201d Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s in marked contrast to Joe Biden, who sits in his basement and lobs ineffective partisan hand grenades with the sole purpose of turning a health crisis into a political weapon.\u201d\n\nTrump himself has vacillated over the usefulness of the briefings, first defending them and pointing to strong ratings before lamenting his coverage by the news media.\n\n\u201cThe Wall Street Journal always \u2018forgets\u2019 to mention that the ratings for the White House Press Briefings are \u201cthrough the roof\u201d (Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale, according to @nytimes) & is only way for me to escape the Fake News & get my views across,\u201d Trump tweeted on April 9 after the Journal\u2019s editorial board described the conferences as \u201cwasted\u201d time.\n\nA couple of weeks later, shortly after Trump created a firestorm with his comments about injecting disinfectant, he expressed a different view of the briefings.\n\n\u201cWhat is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,\u201d Trump tweeted on April 25. \u201cThey get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!\u201d\n\nIn the weeks since he ended the daily briefings, Trump has held rallies in coronavirus hotspots; commuted the sentence of political ally Roger Stone; defended Confederate generals and symbols; pledged to sign executive orders on health care and immigration; threatened to cut funding for schools that don\u2019t hold in-person classes this fall; and posed with a Bible in front of a church for a photo op after law enforcement cleared peaceful protesters from the area.\n\nScott Reed, a veteran Republican operative and chief strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said a return to the coronavirus briefings could be an opportunity for the Trump administration to \u201cstop running down unimportant rabbit trails.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe voters care about a solution to the virus,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cGood move that the President is restarting the briefings \u2014 a real chance to deliver a sharp message, repeat it over and over, and exit stage right for the medical pros.\u201d", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-briefings/2020/07/20/5f5c7ade-caa2-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html", "author": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"]}, {"title": "Trump\u2019s Approval Keeps Sinking", "text": "/\n\n/\n\nYou are here:Trump\u2019s Approval Keeps Sinking", "link": "https://politicalwire.com/2020/07/21/trumps-approval-keeps-sinking/", "author": ["Taegan Goddard"]}]}, "en-volve": {"link": "https://en-volve.com/reaction/fake-news/", "articles": [{"title": "The MSM Reported Sexual Assault Claims Against Tucker Carlson And Hannity And They Are HILARIOUSLY Frivolous", "text": "You'll only get the best stuff we have!\n\nGet the best Trump news straight to your inbox!\n\nOn Monday night top talent at FOX News were mentioned in a lawsuit by former employee Jennifer Eckhart and frequent guest Cathy Areu.

Cory Booker and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee have introduced legislation to create a commission, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act.\n\nIn introducing her bill to the House last year, Jackson Lee said, \u201cThe commission aims to study the impact of slavery and continuing discrimination against African-Americans, resulting directly and indirectly from slavery to segregation to the desegregation process and the present day. The commission would also make recommendations concerning any form of apology and compensation to begin the long delayed process of atonement for slavery.\u201d\n\nSince then, reparations have continued to draw attention, and the issue was elevated further during the recent Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nLong at the center of the debate has been the potential price tag of paying slavery descendants, for which studies broadly include most or all of the 41 million black people in the country.\n\nA new study from three college professors said that the ultimate cost could be $6.2 quadrillion. Quadrillion comes after trillion, and one quadrillion has 15 zeros.\n\nThe study suggests a payment of $151 million each, and the cost to every person would be $18.96 million.\n\nThe calculation is somewhat complicated, but it essentially studies the unpaid hours slaves worked, calculates a price for massacres and discrimination, and adds in interest. It is titled \u201cWealth Implications of Slavery and Racial Discrimination for African American Descendants of the Enslaved.\u201d It was published last month in the the Review of Black Political Economy.\n\nThe authors concluded, \u201cWe argue that the U.S. Government should have paid reparations for enslavement and de jure racial discrimination because [of] the ratification of the 5th Amendment in 1791. Article IV, Section 2, of the Constitution established not only slavery but also the personhood of the enslaved, and the 5th Amendment applies to all persons.

Cory Booker, D-N.J., on Monday introduced a bill that would explore slavery reparations as a way of ending American \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201d\n\nIn filing the proposed legislation in the Senate, Booker positioned himself as a leader on an issue that has become trendy among progressives and a hot topic in the 2020 presidential campaign, in which he is a candidate.\n\nThe measure is a companion to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives in January by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, which would study the impact of slavery and racism against African Americans and make recommendations on reparations for descendants of slaves.\n\nA similar reparations bill was first introduced 30 years ago by then-Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.\n\nAccording to Booker, racism continues to prop up white domination of blacks in the United States, and his bill is a step toward changing that.\n\n\u201cThis bill is a way of addressing head-on the persistence of racism, white supremacy, and implicit racial bias in our country,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cSince slavery in this country, we have had overt policies fueled by white supremacy and racism that have oppressed African-Americans economically for generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of our bedrock domestic policies that have ushered millions of Americans into the middle class have systematically excluded blacks through practices like \u2018G.I. Bill\u2019 discrimination and redlining,\u201d Booker added.\n\nAt least eight other Democratic presidential candidates have voiced some degree of support for reparations: Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who served as housing secretary under President Barack Obama, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and high-tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nBooker, who is running for president on a message of national unity , had previously pushed back on pressure to offer a full-throated endorsement of reparations, instead promoting \u201cbaby bonds\u201d that would create a savings account for every child with government contributions based on family wealth.\n\nDuring a recent town hall in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Booker complained to CNN anchor Don Lemon \u2013 who has voiced sympathy for the unique disadvantages conferred by slavery \u2013 that the issue has been \u201creduced to a box to check on a presidential list, when this is so much more of a serious conversation.\n\nHowever, Booker has backed massive government spending, including by cosponsoring the Green New Deal. He has also evinced a heroic self-conception, famously referring to himself as \u201cSpartacus\u201d for supposedly risking punishment by releasing already-public documents during last year\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh. That reparations have become a mainstream issue indicates the success of progressives in pushing identity and race to the center of American politics. Even The New York Times\u2019 conservative opinion columnist David Brooks last month declared himself a convert to the idea.\n\n, critics have argued that paying reparations for slavery would be expensive, impractical, and unjust.

At the beginning of discussion diGenova discussed the John Durham investigation after the hosts shared an audio of DOJ spokesman Kerri Kupec that aired last week. Here is the piece discussed with Bill Hemmer from FOX that diGenova was and the listeners heard:\n\nHemmer: \u201cJohn Durham, when will there be news on that?\u201d Kupec: \u201cWell, we hope to see a report by the end of the summer. Obviously, this is a criminal investigation. The goal is not a report, it\u2019s a criminal investigation. But certainly there is a story to be told there. The American people deserve resolution and frankly justice deserves resolution\u2026\u201d Hemmer: \u201cOkay but you say\u2026\u201d Kupec: \u201c\u2026Justice needs to be restored.

I hope they [Durham] issue the report as soon as possible and that criminal charges occur thereafter. I\u2019m fascinated by the sequence but I\u2019m delighted with what\u2019s happening.\n\nWhen the interviewer suggested that the report and the indictments might happen at the same time, diGenova replied:\n\nDiGenova: Of course, yes, that\u2019s exactly what could happen. You got it right Vince [Coglianese]. I suspected all along that Durham was going to do his best to get something done by September. Actually, I suspected it would be June, indeed I knew that that was the time table but the COVID-19 virus put off some grand jury appearances.\n\nAnd I do know that they are in negotiations with some people for some guilty pleas.

However, Ukrainian ladies are rare and this is a major oversight because these girls are as kind, caring and beautiful as you have always wanted your future wife to be. Not many websites can connect you to Ukrainian women, which is why sites like GoDateNow.com already have advantages. Here are the details of the design and features of GoDateNow.\n\nRegistration and Ladies\n\nTo make you more comfortable as a new user, GoDateNow allows browsing of their site before creating an account, but if you plan to create an account anyway, you can do so at this point too. Fortunately, this process takes only a few minutes. All you need to do is provide your name and email, and specify the kind of woman you are looking for. The registration process can be made even quicker if you sign in with your Facebook or Google account.\n\nGoDateNow \u2018s homepage contains other useful information, such as reviews from men who have found love on the site.\n\nIn addition, you will see a gallery of women who are presently online and ready to chat. You can tell immediately that all photos of women are professionally produced, which may indicate that some profiles may be phony.\n\nIf a woman gets your attention, you should immediately take the time to meet her. Open up the woman\u2019s full profile to see more photos and learn everything she chooses to share about herself, including age, height, weight, occupation, hobbies, children, and other details. There is also a short summary, presumably written by the lady herself, and a description of the kind of man she hopes to meet on GoDateNow.\n\nIf you like what you see and you can imagine a woman as your future wife, GoDateNow offers a variety of contact options. From showing interest and adding to favorites to video chats and requesting contact information, there is a contact method for everyone, even for the timidest. Also, if you want to stand out from other rivals, you can choose to buy her gifts or flowers.\n\nProfile Searching\n\nMost men choose GoDateNow for their famous database of Ukrainian women. However, it is not limited to just women from Ukraine; you can search for girls from other Slavic countries.\n\nThere are several ways to discover the girl of your dreams on GoDateNow. The easiest way is to access the user library, and every time you open the library, you will see a different bunch of women to choose from. These members are chosen completely randomly, which is why it is very unlikely that even one of them will match your requirements.\n\nIn this library, you can also choose to view members who are presently online, members who have recently added new photos or videos to their profile, or new members to the site. If these users get your attention, do give them a warm welcome.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to count on pure chance in such a serious matter of finding your true love and lifelong partner, you can opt for the GoDateNow search function. This is one of the simplest searches we\u2019ve seen on an online dating site, but it does allow you to specify some particulars about your potential match, including her eye and hair color, height, weight, education, and marital status.\n\nThe search results will be displayed in a gallery, which only contains a name, online status and photo, and no more other information about the woman. You will need to open each profile individually if you want to see more details about a lady.\n\nPricing\n\nThe main goal of all international dating platforms is to unite lonely minds, but they also need to make money and each site chooses different ways of doing so. Most offer a paid membership or credit system, and GoDateNow has decided on the latter.\n\nWith GoDateNow\u2019s credit system, the only thing you can do for free is read mail from other members. Everything else, including replying and watching video introductions on a lady\u2019s profile are payable with credits.\n\nThe selling price of credits ranges from $12 for 20 credits to $299 for 750. The number of credits seems a lot, but if you plan on becoming an active Go Date Now user, you may be out of credits faster than expected.\n\nSafety\n\nDespite the high cost of using the site, GoDateNow looks like a website that can be used safely. However, during the investigation, we found that some of the profiles of the women were just too polished and too good to be true. Because GoDateNow does not provide verification measures, it is impossible to know whether the ladies\u2019 profiles are real or not.\n\nSummary\n\nGoDateNow doesn\u2019t have many rivals in the Slavic dating industry, but despite this, we still don\u2019t recommend finding your wife there. At first glance, GoDateNow impresses with a wide range of women, but it\u2019s hard to believe that all women are real and actually spend time talking to the male members of the site. In addition, the credit system, although clearly explained, is too complex and makes you spend more than with a paid membership. All things considered, we believe there are better options in the market.", "link": "https://www.bestbrides.net/godatenow-review-is-it-worth-exploring/", "author": ["Ryan Burger"]}, {"title": "Actor Mark Ruffalo Marches On DC To DEMAND Trump Be Removed From Office", "text": "You'll only get the best stuff we have!\n\nGet the best Trump news straight to your inbox!\n\nActor and activist Mark Ruffalo joined protesters on Thursday marching from Charlottesville, Virginia, to Washington, DC., in an organized ten-day \u201cMarch to Confront White Supremacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeading to Culpeper.

Thunberg released an Instagram monologue, accompanied by some ambient spiritual music, in which she said she was \u201cextremely honored\u201d to receive the prize, but pledged to donate the money to various climate causes \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nIt seems, though, that Thunberg is going to be spending fossil-fuel money to advance her cause. The foundation and the Humanity Prize are named after Calouste Gulbenkian, a British-Armenian oil tycoon who died in 1955.

Come back to Zimbabwe and save us.\n\nThe nation is offering land leases to white commercial farmers in an effort to re-start the nation\u2019s agricultural industry.\n\nBasil Nyabadza from Zimbabwe\u2019s Agricultural and Rural and Development Authority says Zimbabwean farmers exiled in foreign lands should return to \u201chome\u201d soil.\n\nThe Government is now offering 99-year leases to white farmers, a deal previously reserved for black Zimbabweans.\n\nThe resignation of president Robert Mugabe last November and the swearing in of his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa has delivered significant change.\n\nGovernment officials now admit the campaign of farm invasions that began in 2000 was a mistake.\n\n\u201cClearly, the formulas deployed then, left a lot of bad feeling. And more importantly, the intellectual property, left our borders,\u201d Mr Nyabadza said.\n\nWithout its professional, experienced farmers, Zimbabwe went from being an agricultural export powerhouse to having to rely on handouts from the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme.\n\nHyperinflation and a multi-decade depression followed.\n\nHistory repeats\n\nThe news comes as South Africa threatens to follow in Zimbabwe\u2019s doomed footsteps in seizing white farmers land and exiling them from the country.\n\nSouth Africa is teetering on the brink of a race war after President Cyril Ramaphosa called on parliament to pass a law allowing white-owned land to be \u201cconfiscated\u201d by blacks without any form of compensation.\n\nRamaphosa called white land ownership the \u201coriginal sin\u201d, and stated that he wants to see \u201cthe return of the land to the people from whom it was taken\u2026 to heal the divisions of the past.\u201d\n\nHow does he plan on doing that?\n\nForcible confiscation. Specifically\u2013 confiscation without compensation.\n\n\u201cThe expropriation of land without compensation is envisaged as one of the measures that we will use to accelerate redistribution of land to black South Africans.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa did not mince his words. He\u2019s talking about seizing land from white farmers and giving it to black South Africans \u2014 just like in neighboring Zimbabwe.\n\nAstonishingly, Ramaphosa followed up that statement by saying, \u201cWe will handle it in a way that is not going to damage our economy. . .\u201d\n\nIf South Africa refuses to learn the lessons of history, it is doomed to repeat them.\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://newspunch.com/zimbabwe-begs-white-farmers-to-return-as-nation-teeters-on-brink-of-manmade-starvation/#comments", "author": ["Baxter Dmitry"]}, {"title": "CIA Alert Public That More ISIS Attacks Are About To Occur", "text": "CIA Director John Brennan has warned the American public that ISIS are planning more attacks across Europe and America.\n\nDuring an CBS News interview, Brennan said there is a strong likelihood that ISIS will cary out more attacks in the immediate future.\n\n\u201cI think ISIS\u2019 capability to carry out attacks outside of the Syria-Iraq theater could increase in the short term,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nWashingtonexaminer.com reports:\n\nIn a CBS \u201cThis Morning\u201d interview, the nation\u2019s intelligence chief said, \u201cI think ISIS\u2019 capability to carry attacks outside of the Syria and Iraq will continue and could increase.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cCould increase in the short term.\u201d\n\nThe interview came before the attacks over the weekend in Minnesota or New York.\n\nBrennan said that the ISIS attacks around the world are the product of investments by the terror group.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey have invested in this over the past several years.

Four of the six council members will be Muslim: three of them of Bangladeshi descent and one Yemeni. \u201cHamtramck has made history,\u201d said Hamtramck community leader Bill Meyer. \u201cThe election was far from close, with the three Muslim winners each gaining over 1,000 votes, while the other three candidates garnered less than 700 votes each.\u201d Councilman Musa, who came in second place, told the Free Press that he will work to represent everyone in the city regardless of background. \u201cI\u2019m a very good Muslim,\u201d said Musa, an immigrant from Bangladesh. \u201cI try my best to pray five times (a day), but when I get elected, every single ethnic votes for me, not (only) the Muslim vote for me, but Christians, every single ethnic group, African-Americans, Polish. I\u2019m a good friend of the Polish.\u201d \u201cI represent every single citizen in Hamtramck,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m serving all city of Hamtramck.\u201d Formerly known for its Polish population, Hamtramck is now about 24% Arab (mostly Yemeni); 19% African American; 15% Bangladeshi; 12% Polish; and 6% Yugoslavian (many Bosnian), according to U.S. Census figures. The percentage of residents who are Muslim is unclear since the U.S. Census does not ask about religion. Estimates of the Muslim population range from one-third to more than one-half of city residents. Almost all of the Yemeni Americans in Hamtramck are Muslim, while the growing Bangaldeshi-American community in Hamtramck has Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The city has a Bangladeshi Hindu temple and Bangladeshi mosques. On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder attended the opening of Bangla Town, an area that will celebrate Bangladeshi-American culture in Hamtramck and bordering Detroit neighborhoods. About 41% of the city are immigrants, the highest percentage among cities in metro Detroit. Pope John Paul II, who was Polish, visited Hamtramck in 1987; a statue of him commemorating his visit is in a city park. Three of the Muslims on Hamtramck\u2019s City Council are of Bangladeshi descent, while Almasmari is of Yemeni descent. The council\u2019s only other Arab-American Muslim in its history was Abdul Algazali, who died in February. The issue of Islam has sometimes come up in recent years as the Muslim population grows. After contentious debate, the city allowed in 2004 the Muslim call to prayer to be broadcast publicly five times a day from mosques through loudspeakers. The call to prayer has drawn complaints from residents who say it\u2019s loud and intrusive, waking them up early and bothering them. City Council candidate Susan Dunn, who came in fourth place, raised the issue during the campaign, prompting a response from Almasmari during a city council meeting last month. \u201cWe all want to live peacefully and respectfully,\u201d he said to the council during the October meeting, according to a video he posted to his Facebook account. \u201cOur special thing is \u2026 the diversity in this town.\u201d Almasmari said the call to prayer \u201cis not as loud as (Dunn) thinks.\u201d Moreover, if \u201cwe are considering the call to prayer as noise,\u201d then so would \u201cthe loud music all night long while we are sleeping.\u201d \u201cWe as Muslims respect our neighbors and we don\u2019t like to bother anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the Prophet Mohammed said: he who believes in Allah and the last day, let him not harm his neighbors.\u201d Meyer, who is not Muslim, said that Muslims in Hamtramck \u201chave helped bring stability, security and sobriety while lessening the amount of drugs and crime in the city.\u201d\n\nIf they are in Michigan legally they need to follow our laws.

While non-Muslim families have a seemingly limitless range of possible names to choose from, tradition is still very important for Muslim families, including the custom of naming a son after the Prophet. In fact, the name is so popular that many Muhammads shorten their name to Md., Mohd., or Muhd. and go by a less common name.\n\nThe number of Muhammads born in America will only increase which means Islam will wield more power in the United States.\n\nCAIR\u2019s Executive Director Nihad Awad recently said at the organization\u2019s 25th annual gala in DC that his goal is to get 30 Muslims elected to Congress.\n\nBut Awad didn\u2019t stop there \u2013 he also envisioned at least one Muslim placed on the Supreme Court (Sharia law) along with Muslim federal judges (more Sharia law) and more Muslims in Hollywood.\n\nRecall, back in 1998, CAIR\u2019s Chairman Omar Ahmad said, \u201cIslam isn\u2019t in America to be equal to any other faith, but to become dominant.\u201d\n\nEvery Muslim member of Congress is closely tied to CAIR, an unindicted co-conspirator of the largest terror funding case in US history \u2014 Had enough yet, America?\n\nFacebook has greatly reduced the distribution of our stories in our readers\u2019 newsfeeds and is instead promoting mainstream media sources.

The fact is he hates America and all of us.\n\nIf anyone still has any doubts about former President Barack Obama\u2019s relationship with Islam, we are happy to clear that out for him thanks to a 4-minute video that Sean Hannity posted on the Internet.\n\nEven though Obama emphatically claimed he was Christian as he ran for the presidency, backed up by regular attendance at a church led by Reverend Jeremiah Wright when he lived in Chicago, his anti-Christian and pro-Islamic sentiment has become obvious.\n\nThanks to FNC\u2019s Sean Hannity, we now have a four-minute supercut of President Obama\u2019s greatest hits when it comes to Islam.\n\nHannity offers Obama\u2019s glorification of one of the most primitive and barbaric dogmas the world has ever known, showing that Obama stretches the truth and takes liberty with his authority to talk on behalf of the American people.\n\nIn the video, Obama says, \u201cWe will convey our deep appreciation for the Islamic faith, which has done so much over the centuries to shape the world.

That\u2019s because she\u2019s proud of the great nation we live in for what it was and is not for what she wants it to be.\n\nThe president and first lady greet trick-or-treaters from over 20 Maryland, Virginia, and District of Columbia schools, as well as military families and community organizations. Finally, class and elegance are back in the White House!\n\nMany pictures and clips from the night have surfaced on Twitter of the first lady\u2019s priceless reactions to some of the kid\u2019s costumes. Watch them below!\n\nTrump and the first lady, welcomed dinosaurs, athletes, police officers, skeletons and bunch of kids. Trick-or-treaters took home individual gift bags containing presidential M&Ms, a home-baked cookie, and other candies.\n\nTrump and his wife chatted with their guests, with the president at times going in for a high-five or posing for photos, including with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her family, as well as a skeleton accompanied by a kid sporting one of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps.\n\nOne girl even dressed up as Melania Trump, wearing the outfit she famously changed into after wearing heels to board a plane to Texas to meet with Hurricane Harvey victims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpot on.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe the media produced such beautiful kids. How the media did this, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Trump exclaimed as the youngsters crowded around his historic desk.\n\nWhat a festive Haloween at the White House! It appears that a good time was had by all. First Lady Melania was elegant as usual, and her handsome husband and President was the perfect complement to the evening. Glad to see the President take time from his busy schedule and the weight of his office to enjoy the event with all the kids and their parents. Love our First Couple. They belong in the White House and that is why the American people placed them there. FLOTUS Melania and the POTUS are an asset to our country.
