The decline was more than twice as large as in the Great Recession a decade ago, but occurred in a fraction of the time. The only possible comparisons in modern American history came during the Great Depression and the demobilization after World War II, both of which predated modern economic statistics.\n\nEconomists and epidemiologists alike describe the U.S. failure to control the virus during the initial shutdown as a missed opportunity. The government\u2019s efforts at financial support were largely successful: After plummeting in March and April, retail sales rose in May and June as stimulus payments and a $600 weekly federal supplement to unemployment benefits began flowing into consumers\u2019 bank accounts. Loans made under the Paycheck Protection Program allowed small businesses to begin bringing back furloughed workers.\n\nThe wave of evictions and foreclosures that many economists predicted early in the recession largely failed to materialize. But those programs have expired or are about to do so. And efforts to extend them have been delayed in Congress by disagreements \u2014 between the parties, and among Republicans \u2014 about how and how much to spend.\n\n\u201cThe lesson from the early policy experiments is that it is possible to support the income of people and to offset those financial constraints,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist and a senior fellow at the Indeed Hiring Lab. \u201cBut now as of today, we\u2019re not going to have that anymore.\u201d\n\nThe up-and-down nature of the recovery is shown by Russian River Brewing Company in Sonoma County, Calif.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/business/economy/q2-gdp-coronavirus-economy.html", "author": ["Ben Casselman"]}, {"title": "Grilled by Lawmakers, Big Tech Turns Up the Gaslight", "text": "\u201cI don\u2019t know the specifics of that situation,\u201d Mr. Bezos replied.\n\nAt another point, Mr. Pichai, asked to explain whether it was anticompetitive for Google to threaten to delist Yelp if it didn\u2019t allow the company\u2019s search engine to use its listings in its featured snippets, said he was \u201chappy to engage and understand the specifics\u201d at a later date.

And the panel\u2019s format \u2014 rapid-fire rounds of questioning conducted over video conference, with each member given only five minutes at a time to question the witnesses \u2014 nearly guaranteed that the conversation would remain surface-level.\n\nIn addition, many Republican members of the subcommittee seemed to have no interest in antitrust issues at all, preferring instead to ride partisan hobby horses like claims of anti-conservative bias on social media.\n\nBut many Democratic members came armed with real, substantive questions that deserved a fuller airing. The executives\u2019 choice to sidestep these questions \u2014 or their inability to answer before being cut off \u2014 may signal that they still believe they can run circles around Congress without engaging in hard, detailed conversations about how they exercise their power.\n\nThat may have been a reasonable conclusion to draw after the past several years, a period in which Silicon Valley giants added hundreds of billions of dollars in market value while Washington barely gave it a passing glance. Despite plenty of clamoring, lawmakers have failed to pass any meaningful privacy or data protection laws during President Trump\u2019s time in office, and Mr. Trump has shown little interest in any tech regulation that does not involve his own Twitter account.\n\nBut it is less clear that a say-nothing strategy will continue to work, now that lawmakers have begun doing their homework.

More than three billion people come to Facebook or one of its family of apps on a regular basis. Credit... Jim Wilson/The New York Times Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, displayed the social network\u2019s enormous financial clout on Thursday, even as the company has dealt with regulatory scrutiny and advertiser boycotts. Facebook\u2019s revenue for the second quarter rose 11 percent from a year earlier to $18.7 billion, while profit jumped 98 percent to $5.2 billion. The results were well above analysts\u2019 estimates of $17.3 billion in revenue with a profit of $3.9 billion, according to data provided by FactSet. More than three billion people come to Facebook or one of its family of apps on a regular basis, as the services have overtaken much of the developed world. And some 2.47 billion people use one or more of Facebook\u2019s apps every day. The company said its number of monthly active users rose 12 percent from a year ago and added that it was seeing record levels of engagement and usage this year because of the coronavirus pandemic and the shelter-in-place orders around the world. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to be able to provide small businesses the tools they need to grow and be successful online during these challenging times,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, who was grilled by lawmakers on Wednesday over Facebook\u2019s power. \u201cAnd we\u2019re proud that people can rely on our services to stay connected when they can\u2019t always be together in person.\u201d Facebook\u2019s earnings have long been a bright spot for the Silicon Valley company. Despite increasing scrutiny from regulators, questions about its role in subverting elections and how people use the platform to spread misinformation, users have continued coming back to its services. Because of this, advertisers have consistently spent money on the platform. But that started changing in late June when a grass-roots campaign, Stop Hate For Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook to pull back their spending because of issues of hate speech on the site. Facebook has tried to assuage the concerns, but has made it clear that it will not change its policy about free speech on the site based on outside threats to the business. Facebook cautioned investors on Thursday that fallout from the ad boycott was noticeable in July. The company warned that greater economic turmoil from the pandemic could also eventually affect its bottom line. \u2014\n\nAmazon\u2019s earnings double as sales surge. Copied to clipboard. Americans have flocked to Amazon during the pandemic. Credit... Philip Cheung for The New York Times Buoyed by a pandemic-induced surge in online shopping, Amazon on Thursday reported record sales and profits in the latest quarter. Amazon had $88.9 billion in quarterly sales, up 40 percent from a year earlier. Profit doubled, to $5.2 billion, even though the company invested heavily to improve the safety in Amazon\u2019s warehouses. Analysts expected the company to have $81.4 billion in sales and $665 million in profit, according estimates compiled by FactSet, a financial data firm. Shares in the company jumped more than 6 percent in after-hours trading. \u201cSimply put, Covid-19, in our view, has injected Amazon with a growth hormone,\u201d Tom Forte, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson & Company, wrote in a recent note to investors. The profit came even as Amazon invested $9 billion in expanding warehouses and other capital expenditures to increase its capacity. \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s finance chief, said on a call with reporters. In April, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, told investors to expect no operating profit, and maybe even a loss, as the company planned to spend about $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses, including temporary pay increases, declines in warehouse efficiency because of social distancing and $300 million for testing its work force for the virus. \u201cIf you\u2019re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we\u2019re not thinking small,\u201d he said at the time. Amazon had been paying workers an extra $2 an hour, but that benefit expired in May. At the end of June, it announced one-time \u201cthank you\u201d bonus of $500 for full-time associates in its warehouses. But even those costs did not compare to the immense surge in demand, with online retail sales up 48 percent. As Americans have stayed home during the virus, they have flocked to online shopping. \u201cE-commerce is off the charts right now,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee whose company, CommerceIQ, helps major consumer brands manager their Amazon business. The initial shock of panic buying has subsided, but \u201cdemand is starting to stabilize, at a much higher level,\u201d he said. Mr. Olsavsky said customers returned to buying more profitable products, like clothing, versus lower-margin groceries and cleaning suppliers. One of the biggest challenges Amazon had expected was keeping up with demand, as the virus flared among its workers and the communities where they live. Mr. Olsavsky said the company was able to fulfill more orders than it had previously expected. The number of products it sold grew 57 percent, but the number of employees it had was up just 34 percent. On the call with reporters, Amazon declined to say if it would be paying its warehouse workers more in the current quarter. It said that pandemic-related expenses would fall to $2 billion in the quarter. Sales at Amazon\u2019s lucrative cloud computing business, whose customers range from major corporations to start-ups, grew 29 percent, to $10.8 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, though it was more profitable than they expected. \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlphabet\u2019s revenue drops, but beats Wall Street expectations. Copied to clipboard. A revenue decline at Alphabet, the parent of Google, came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside its search results. Credit... Jason Henry for The New York Times Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday, hurt by a slowdown in spending by advertisers. Alphabet said its revenue fell 2 percent to $38.3 billion in the second quarter compared with a year ago. The decline came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside its search results because of the coronavirus pandemic, although the company posted an increase in revenue from YouTube ads and its cloud-computing business. The results were the first time that quarterly revenue had declined in its 17 years as a publicly traded company, but Alphabet exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations for revenue and profit. Net profit totaled $6.96 billion, down 30 percent from a year ago. \u2014\n\nFord made $1.1 billion profit in the second quarter even as sales tumbled. Copied to clipboard. The coronavirus pandemic forced Ford and other automakers to close factories for nearly two months starting in March. Credit... Nolis Anderson for The New York Times Ford Motor said Thursday it earned $1.1 billion in the second quarter as a large one-time gain in the value of its investment in an autonomous driving company more than offset losses in its main business. Without the gain, from its stake in Argo AI, Ford lost $1.9 billion excluding interest and taxes. The result was better than Ford\u2019s earlier forecast of a pretax loss of $5 billion. The coronavirus pandemic forced Ford and other automakers to close factories for nearly two months starting in March. On Wednesday, General Motors said it lost $758 million in the second quarter. Ford said in a statement that it expected \u201cno further significant coronavirus-related disruptions to production\u201d in the second half of the year. But the company also said it was not expecting \u201cmeaningful change in the current economic conditions.\u201d Ford\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hackett, said in a conference call that reductions in spending and an efficient restart of production enabled the company to avoid the kind of dire results it forecast in April. In after-hours trading, Ford shares rose more than 2 percent to about $6.90. The automaker forecast that it would earn $500 million to $1.5 billion on a pretax basis in the third quarter, amid weaker demand for new vehicles, parts and services. Ford\u2019s deliveries of new vehicles fell by half to 645,000 in the second quarter largely because of the pandemic. Its auto operations lost money in every region in the world, including a $954 million setback in North America. The company used up $5.3 billion in cash in the quarter, but said it still has $39 billion on hand at the end of June. Ford recorded a gain of $3.5 billion from a transaction related to an alliance it formed with Volkswagen, which bought a stake in Argo AI. Ford has been trying for three years to streamline its operations and return to robust profits, but has come under criticism for slow progress. Mr. Hackett said Ford was pinning its hopes on new vehicles it unveiled in the last few weeks: a redesigned version of its F-150 pickup truck and a line of rugged sport-utility vehicles that will be marketed under the Bronco name. The company said it had already taken reservations for 150,000 Broncos. \u2014\n\nApple blows past expectations with surging sales and profits. Copied to clipboard. Consumers bought huge amounts of Apple products despite a global economic slowdown. Credit... Victor J. Blue for The New York Times From April through June, millions of people lost their jobs, thousands of businesses closed \u2014 and Apple made a further $11.25 billion in profits. A global economic slowdown in the second quarter did not faze one of the world\u2019s richest and most resilient companies, as people kept buying Apple devices en masse and paid the tech giant billions of dollars more for apps and services on those gadgets. Apple said its sales rose 11 percent to $59.7 billion and its profits increased 12 percent to $11.25 billion. Both figures handily beat analysts\u2019 expectations, with Wall Street having forecast declines in both areas. Revenue rose for all of Apple\u2019s product categories and in all of its geographic areas, unusual success even by Apple\u2019s lofty standards. Sales were particularly strong for iPads and Mac computers, as the public was increasingly forced to work and socialize virtually because of the pandemic. Revenue also surged in its internet-services business, which includes Apple\u2019s cut of sales from the App Store, the subject of antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe. Even the iPhone, which remains the company\u2019s biggest seller, notched a slight increase in sales for only the second time in the past seven quarters. Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview that the shift to working and learning from home had led more people to splurge on Apple\u2019s devices. \u201cOur products and services are very relevant to our customers\u2019 lives, and in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,\u201d he said. But while the pandemic has further entrenched the biggest tech companies\u2019 power, Mr. Maestri disputed the idea that it had been good for business, saying the quarter would have been even stronger without it. \u201cWe believe we\u2019ve lost several billion dollars because of the pandemic,\u201d he said. Investors have flocked to Apple\u2019s shares as a safe haven from an economic recession, pushing its stock price up about 30 percent this year to a roughly $1.67 trillion value. \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n1.43 million filed new state unemployment claims last week. Copied to clipboard. Waiting for help with an unemployment insurance claim at an event in Tulsa, Okla., last week. Credit... Joseph Rushmore for The New York Times The number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits totaled 1.43 million last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It was the 19th straight week that the tally exceeded one million, an unheard-of figure before the coronavirus pandemic. And it was the second weekly increase in a row after nearly four months of declines, a sign of how the rebound in cases has undercut the economy\u2019s nascent recovery. Claims for the previous week totaled 1.42 million. New claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the government\u2019s program aimed at covering freelancers, the self-employed and other workers not covered by traditional unemployment benefits, totaled 830,000, down from 975,000 the week before. Those numbers, unlike the figures for state claims, are not seasonally adjusted.

March April May June July \u201cWe\u2019re still in a desperate situation,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton in Chicago. Noting that weekly claims were in the 200,000 range before the pandemic brought widespread shutdowns in March, she added, \u201cThis is unique in terms of the speed and magnitude of the job losses.\u201d What\u2019s more, fears are growing that after rebounding strongly in May and June, the economy has run out of steam, with many states reversing the reopening of businesses. \u201cEveryone wants to keep putting on rose-colored glasses, but it\u2019s blinding us to the reality of the situation and what we have to deal with,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. At the same time, the $600 supplemental weekly unemployment payment from the federal government is ending, a potentially crippling financial blow to millions. Republicans have proposed replacing the supplement with a $200 weekly payment, while Democrats want to extend it in full. \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere close to a deal,\u201d Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said Wednesday. \u2014\n\nConsumer spending plummeted in the second quarter, but not across the board. Copied to clipboard. Consumer spending is the bedrock of the U.S. economy, but shopping hotbeds like 34th Street in Manhattan have suffered during the pandemic. Credit... Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Consumer spending, the bedrock of the U.S. economy, plunged 10.1 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. It was by far the biggest drop on record. But the decline wasn\u2019t across the board \u2014 and the details help paint a picture of life in a pandemic. Spending on services fell 13.3 percent, led by a near-total collapse in spending on restaurant meals and recreation, the department\u2019s report on quarterly economic output noted. Health care spending fell sharply, too, as patients canceled elective procedures and delayed routine care. Spending on goods was a different story. Overall goods expenditures fell a modest 3 percent, and some quarantine-friendly categories actually had increases. Spending on recreational vehicles and related goods rose nearly 9 percent as consumers sought ways to travel without getting on airplanes. Other parts of the economy showed large contractions. Business investment, residential construction and trade \u2014 both imports and exports \u2014 all fell by double-digit percentages. One exception: Spending by the federal government rose 4.1 percent as Congress moved to prevent deeper economic damage. (That figure reflects only a small fraction of the government stimulus efforts, much of which are considered \u201ctransfer payments\u201d that aren\u2019t counted in gross domestic product.) \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStocks drop as economic numbers highlight the pandemic\u2019s toll. Copied to clipboard. Volunteers at a food bank in Davis, Calif., last week. \u201cThe path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain,\u201d the Federal Reserve chair said Wednesday. Credit... Max Whittaker for The New York Times Stocks slid on Thursday as economic reports from the United States and Germany showed the toll of the coronavirus outbreak on growth, but a rally in shares of big technology companies, ahead of their earnings reports, helped minimize the blow to Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell about half a percent, while shares in Europe were down by more than 2 percent. The Nasdaq composite climbed as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all rose. The largest technology companies often set the direction of the broad market because of their sheer size. Oil prices were also lower, as were shares of energy companies. ConocoPhillips slid after the company said its earnings plunged by more than analysts had expected. Financial stocks, closely tied to the cyclical ups and downs of the American economy, slumped too, as long-term interest rates \u2014 set by the yields on government bonds \u2014 continued to plumb some of the lowest levels in history. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 0.55 percent on Thursday morning. Such yields help set the price of the loans banks make and significantly influence their profitability. The U.S. economy shrank by 9.5 percent in the second quarter, while Germany\u2019s economy shrank by 10.1 percent. On an annualized basis, the standard way of reporting quarterly economic data, U.S. gross domestic product fell at a rate of 32.9 percent, which is the sharpest drop on record. Data released at the same time showed that 1.43 million Americans filed new state unemployment claims, the second week in which that number has risen and a figure that highlights the persistence of the economic downturn. The grim data came a day after Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, told reporters that the \u201cpace of recovery looks like it has slowed,\u201d pointing to debit and credit card spending and hiring trends. He added, \u201cThe path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Granville and\n\nComcast saw 10 million sign-ups for its streaming service Peacock. Copied to clipboard. Comcast hopes to have 35 million users for its Peacock streaming service by 2024. Credit... Carlo Allegri/Reuters Comcast, the largest cable operator in the U.S., reported on Thursday $23.7 billion in revenue and $7.9 billion in adjusted profit for the second quarter, beating expectations. Here are the highlights: Peacock, its new streaming product, attracted 10 million sign-ups in its first three months. It differs from other platforms like HBO Max (which netted 4.1 million in one month) and Netflix in that it is free and relies on advertising for revenue. (There is a paid tier that features more content but still includes ads.) The strategy is reminiscent of the original broadcast system, which is also free. Comcast hopes to have 35 million users by 2024. With most of the country under lockdown, Comcast added 323,000 more broadband customers, but it lost 477,000 pay TV subscribers. People switched to cheaper streaming alternatives as wallets tightened under the pandemic. It\u2019s not a bad trade for Comcast, since a broadband subscriber tends to add more profit than a video one. At NBCUniversal, the lack of sports and the shutdown of movie theaters and theme parks hurt the division. Sales fell 25 percent to $6.1 billion. Theme parks took a $399 million loss for the quarter, and the Universal Studios division saw sales decline nearly a fifth to $1.2 billion. But a significant deal was struck this week between Universal and AMC Entertainment, the nation\u2019s largest theater chain, that could recast the economics of the film industry. The studio can now sell movies on streaming 17 days after it runs in theaters, collapsing the usual 90-day window. Movies tend to make most of its box office dollars in the first two weekends, so the new terms appear to benefit the studio. In other words, there will be more reasons to stay home. \u2014", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus", "author": ["Mike Isaac", "Karen Weise", "Daisuke Wakabayashi", "Neal E.

Representative Jerry Nadler, Democrat of New York, confronted Mr. Zuckerberg with the C.E.O.\u2019s own emails, saying they showed a plot to take out a young competitor. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, said Google was biased and asked Mr. Pichai whether the company would change its products to help elect Joseph R. Biden for president.\n\nIn one of the sharpest exchanges, Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, confronted Mr. Bezos on accusations that an Amazon lawyer had lied to the committee about how the company develops its own products. She asked him to answer whether it misused data with a yes or no.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question yes or no,\u201d said Mr. Bezos, appearing rattled.\n\nYet while the hearing was ripe with theater, any impact will be limited by antitrust laws that were created a century ago and that are imperfect for corralling internet firms. Since the 1980s, enforcement officials have used the notion of consumer welfare as the predominant test for antitrust violations \u2014 generally meaning that if prices are not going up, the markets are most likely competitive enough. The tech giants have generally not driven up prices of digital services or consumer goods; many do not charge at all for services like Google Maps or Instagram.\n\nWhile Democrats at the hearing indicated they were more inclined to change antitrust law, Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, said he did not think the laws needed to change. Ultimately, Congress doesn\u2019t have the power to break up the companies.\n\nStill, the proceedings provided fuel to other investigations of the tech companies by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. The Justice Department is expected to soon announce charges against Google accusing it of abusing its dominance in online advertising, people with knowledge of the investigation have said. The F.T.C. is preparing to question Mr. Zuckerberg under oath in its investigation of Facebook\u2019s grip over social networking and acquisitions of nascent rivals.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical juncture in how the Washington policy clash with the titans of Silicon Valley unfolds,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official and a special adviser to the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge.\n\nRegulators around the world are also moving to limit the power of the tech giants. Europe has led the charge with antitrust investigations and Margrethe Vestager, the region\u2019s top trustbuster, recently vowed to take a harder line on the companies.

Assistance, though, is more uneven.\n\nNormally, individual states run their own unemployment programs, setting different benefit levels and eligibility rules. On average, benefits replace about 45 percent of a worker\u2019s weekly paycheck. Freelance, self-employed and part-time workers, who didn\u2019t qualify for state benefits but received funds through the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, tended to get a much smaller fraction of their previous earnings.\n\nThat is where the extra $600 a week came in. It was meant to make up for lost income and ensure recipients had enough money to buy food, pay rent, keep the lights on, afford medical prescriptions or make car payments. Lawmakers settled on a lump sum as the quickest and easiest way to deliver assistance \u2014 given the limited capabilities of already overwhelmed state unemployment networks.\n\nThe money was crucial in supplying the economy with fuel to keep the engine going, economists say. Like any one-size-fits-all measure, however, the $600 supplement fell outside the target zone in many instances. Roughly two-thirds of workers ended up with more income than they would have earned had they not lost their jobs.

The decision to raise money collectively and give grants to the countries hit hardest by the pandemic was a message that there is some political will left to further the project that created the euro two decades ago.

Some of the datelines in his dispatches were different from today \u2014 Canton, Hankow, Mukden, Peiping \u2014 yet much of his observations still ring true.\n\nIn Beijing, he found more than just a city but also a way of life that defied the strictures of Communism. \u201cNo rubber stamp yet dictates the passions and peculiarities of its people,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cYou are filled with indignation in one moment and moved to admiration in the next.\u201d Excerpt from a 1950s notebook A selection from one of my father\u2019s reporting notebooks, as well as a photo he took of a man in Beijing.\n\nIt is the same today.

But when he sneaked backstage he bumped into a big blackboard.\n\nAn excerpt from an article about the actor that ran in The Boston Globe. On it was an essay written by one of the actors, he was told. \u201cIt is called: \u2018Who are my friends and who are my enemies?\u2019\u201d It turned out, in fact, to be a confession written by someone who had complained, \u201cthis government gives me a pain.\u201d\n\nAs my six-month assignment in China came to an end, the country was preparing to celebrate 70 years of Chinese Communist Party rule. Every corner of the country was whipped up into celebratory fervor. Huge billboards of a smiling Xi Jinping with proclamations about China lined the highways. When my husband and I traveled through the mountains on a rickety bus in the southwest, we started a new game to pass the time: Spot President Xi.\n\nThe day before the parade I found myself sharing a cab to the airport in Shenzhen with Walter Liu, a 37-year-old Beijing native who now lives in California. Mr. Liu and his high school had participated in the 50th anniversary parade in 1999 when he was 17. He and his classmates were given pink and yellow blocks of paper to hold in a formation on Tiananmen Square. From above the sign read \u201c50.\u201d\n\nIt was the culmination of two months of rehearsals, first at his high school and then later during midnight rehearsals on Tiananmen Square.\n\nWhat Mr. Liu remembered most vividly was the excitement of being able to see his girlfriend during those midnight sessions. \u201cIt is rare that you could see your girlfriend at night,\u201d he said, smiling as he recalled it. \u201cWe could just look at each other from the crowd and wink wink. We couldn\u2019t even talk.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the parade, his parents squinted, trying to find him on their television. \u201cI don\u2019t think they could see me because I was so tiny,\u201d said Mr. Liu, laughing. \u201cI was one color pixel on TV.\u201d\n\nMy ticket to the anniversary parade. On the day of the 70th anniversary parade I, too, was a pixel. I had managed to persuade the government to give me a highly prized ticket to watch the parade from the stands, just as my father had done at the end of his first China tour.\n\nIt was an unusually hot day and the air was heavy with smog. Everyone had an identifier. Blue uniformed sanitation workers. Green soldiers. Dark blue naval officers. Blue-and-white track-suited volunteers.

As they rolled out on huge floats, loud cheers erupted from the bleachers. Mao\u2019s portrait came first. The biggest cheer was reserved for the last portrait, of Xi.\n\nThere is much discussion today among intellectuals in China about how the state looks much more like it did under Mao than at any other time since the country opened itself up to the world four decades ago.\n\nI wish I could ask my father about that.

And this is \u201cThe Argument.\u201d [MUSIC PLAYING] Today, our guest is writer and historian Anne Applebaum. We\u2019ll talk about how authoritarianism became so appealing to conservative thinkers in the 21st century. [MUSIC PLAYING] Anne Applebaum\u2019s latest book is \u201cTwilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism.\u201d It\u2019s part memoir, part history, the story of people she once called friends, anti-communist intellectuals and conservative defenders of liberal ideals who, during the Cold War, fought for things like an independent press and a free market. In recent years, these same friends have become foot soldiers in the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism in the West. I read the book and found it utterly fascinating, even though I disagreed with a big part of Applebaum\u2019s premise. As I wrote in a recent column, \u201cthere\u2019s no mystery in the right\u2019s surrender to authoritarianism because for many of the people Applebaum describes, it wasn\u2019t a surrender at all, it was a liberation.\u201d Anne, not surprisingly, disagrees, writing on Twitter, \u201cIt is just as incorrect to write, quote, \u2018conservatism always contained the seeds of authoritarianism,\u2019 as it is to write progressivism always contained the seeds of authoritarianism.\u201d It is an honor to get to debate it with her on the show today. Anne, welcome to \u201cThe Argument.\u201d\n\nanne applebaum\n\nThanks so much for talking to me.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBefore you explain why you think my argument about your book is wrong, maybe you could just give a sense of the case that the book is making or the story that the book is telling.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo first of all, to be clear, the book doesn\u2019t really make a case. This isn\u2019t a political science book.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nMmhmm.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have a thesis. It\u2019s not an op-ed column. It rather is a reflection on a series of events that I took part in or I was aware of or people that I knew over the last 20 and 30 years. My previous books were works of history in which I did lots of research, and then I tried to show a problem from lots of points of view. And this is really the opposite of that. It\u2019s a very narrow and subjective view, including some events that I have a role in or I\u2019m somehow implicated in or biased about. It\u2019s about four countries, mostly about the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, with a big chunk about Hungary and some reflections on Spain. And it looks at the evolution of the right in all of those countries or the thing that used to be called the conservative movement or the center right or the Tories or the Polish Right or the Republican Party, and it observes that some people who used to think they were on the same side 20 or 30 years ago now are not. I start with a party at my house that took place in 1999. It was not a fancy party. And no, it\u2019s not a book about parties or catering. That just was a metaphor that I used for this alliance.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNo, it\u2019s a cinematic intro.\n\nanne applebaum\n\n[LAUGHING] And I try to explain that some of the people who were at that party are now people who I no longer speak to and many of the other people at the party no longer speak to. And the reasons are not personal, they\u2019re political. We\u2019re now all on opposite sides of this very profound political divide in Poland, which is a very profoundly polarized country, some ways weirdly like the United States in which people live in alternate informational universes and don\u2019t speak to each other and have a completely different view of the world. And so the book was a kind of reflection about how those deep divides happen, what causes polarization. There are a few historical references. I talk about the Dreyfus trial in France, which was a similarly polarizing moment in French history. I talk about division over Brexit, which was different in many ways from the Polish division, but also caused everybody to get mad at each other. And I tried to show what were some of the deeper reasons for these changes. Again, the book has no thesis. It doesn\u2019t argue that there is one explanation, and it looks rather for historical echoes across countries rather than tying everything together in a neat knot. I spent a lot of time, like you both do, writing op-ed columns that have to end with a single paragraph saying, x is y, [BRUNI LAUGHS] and therefore we should do z. And it was really a relief in this book to write something in which, no, sorry, I\u2019m not going to tie up all the loose ends for you. You\u2019re just going to have to figure it out yourself.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nIt was really striking to me, your use of Fritz Stern\u2019s \u201cThe Politics of Cultural Despair\u201d to sort of diagnose some of what you were seeing on the contemporary right. Stern was a history professor and a refugee from Nazi Germany who wrote about conservative intellectuals. So I also used \u201cThe Politics of Cultural Despair\u201d to try to diagnose the contemporary right, but I did it in a book that came out in 2006. So I\u2019m just going to put this quote out there that I used to try to explain what was going on in George W. Bush\u2019s re-election campaign in 2004. \u201cThe ideologists of the conservative revolution superimposed division of national redemption upon the dissatisfaction with liberal culture and with the loss of authoritative faith. They posed as the true champions of nationalism and berated the socialists for their internationalism and the liberals for their pacifism and their indifference to national greatness.\u201d And so I guess this is maybe the heart of our disagreement, right? I mean, I think I agree with you obviously about the horrors of Trumpism, but I do see it as more of a sort of evolutionary maybe inevitability of trends that were certainly present in the American right through most of my adult life as opposed to this real break with what had previously been known as conservatism. One of the things I saw specifically when I was covering George W. Bush\u2019s re-election in 2004 was a lot of talk about the, quote unquote, \u201chomosexual agenda\u201d as a kind of totalizing ideology. So when I read what you\u2019ve written about, the use of anti-gay prejudice almost as a kind of conspiracy theory in Polish politics, that seemed really familiar to me.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo I\u2019m not really disagreeing with you about that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s incorrect to say that some of the seeds of what we\u2019re seeing now were present 15 or 20 years ago. I think my disagreement is that I believe that the anti-communist movement, which is, remember, the book begins at a slightly different moment, not in 2007, but in 1999, and it\u2019s reflecting on an earlier period, which is the late 1980s and early 1990s. I\u2019m arguing that the anti-communist movement in that period had different components, and people were anti-communist for different reasons. Some of them were anti-communist because they believed in Realpolitik and they were worried about Soviet nuclear weapons, OK? And some people were anti-communist because they cared about democracy and human rights and the rule of law. And there were some people who were anti-communist because they were Christians and the Soviet Union was Marxist and atheist, and therefore they were against it for that reason. And one of the things that I trace in the book is this idea that that coalition over time break up. I think I even say at one point that it was probably artificially held together by 9/11, which kind of kept some people on the same team for longer than they might have been anyway. I mean, you could even argue that it was breaking up by the end of the \u201890s in the United States. And the same is true in Poland, where the anti-communist movement in Poland had people in it whom you would describe as left-wing. There were a lot of anti-communist children of communists and so on. As these different bits of it broke up, some people went in one direction and some people went in another. So I\u2019m not actually disagreeing about that. I mean, I think what I\u2019m disagreeing about is your implication that this was somehow inevitable, that, of course, the right would end up like that because the right was always authoritarian, and that\u2019s what it was about. That I disagree with. If you\u2019d been looking at the left in the 1980s, you might have been able to make that same argument. I was actually looking for a copy of my own book, which I can\u2019t seem to find, which is my history of the Gulag that was published in 2004.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nAnd in the introduction to that book, I talk a little bit about the communist tolerant part of the Western left, which chose to ignore and dismiss and downplay the existence of Soviet concentration camps because it was politically inconvenient. There was a piece of the left that was always also charmed by authoritarianism and tempted by extremism. Well, that\u2019s also in my new book a little bit too. But if I\u2019d said at that time, well, of course, it was inevitable that the left will therefore from this moment develop into an authoritarian movement, I would have been wrong. I mean, it could have been that those elements took over the left, and actually in one or two countries they did.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nThe point is that these movements were, particularly in the United States where we\u2019re cursed with our two party system, these movements are coalitions, and I was simply dissecting what happened to the right-wing coalition or the center right coalition that I felt myself to be a part of and clearly no longer do. I simply don\u2019t think that Trumpism was some kind of inevitability, that it had to be that way because that was the way the party was going. That there are these elements of cultural despair of deep pessimism about American society of fear and anxiety caused by modernity and technological change and social change, that that is all present on the right right now, of course, it\u2019s absolutely true. I write about it all the time, and it\u2019s part of my book. What I don\u2019t agree with is that retrospectively colors all anti-communists as proto-authoritarians, which would be ridiculous.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOh, I don\u2019t think\u2014 no, I mean, I don\u2019t think it retrospectively colors all anti-communists as proto-authoritarians. I just think \u2014 and I think that this comes out in your book \u2014 that the segment of that coalition that was genuinely concerned about human rights and democracy is smaller than, I think, people would have admitted at the time.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI mean, depends on which country, and it depends which time we\u2019re talking about. A lot of this is also to do with who won power and how and when. The anti-liberal or anti-democratic part of the Polish right, for example, was a fringe minority for 25 years, which had very little influence on Polish politics and was not even really visible. And even the Law and Justice party, which is now the ruling party, it was very briefly in power once before for a year and a half, and it exhibited a much more limited and narrow and less ambitious version of what it\u2019s doing now. It was still then a coalition that contained a wide range of people. Even the Law and Justice president, who was the one who died in the tragic plane crash, was somebody who cared a lot about the rule of law, for example, and polish judges and so on, and it\u2019s hard to imagine him presiding over this destruction of the judicial system that\u2019s taking place now. So that\u2019s around 2005. Even then, they were the truly anti-democratic anti-pluralist piece of the party was a fringe piece of the extreme. And that it has now moved to the center is the drama of the current story.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, I kept on wondering as I was reading you, when you look at the group of you on the right, conservatives, however you want to call yourselves, when you look at your kind of wide group of friends and acquaintances, not just in Poland, but also in Britain and the United States, and I assume you had some in Hungary as well, and you kind of observe who drifted readily, or at least eventually, toward the lure of authoritarianism or some of these more nativist administrations or governments, and who, like you, resisted or like the Never Trumpers here, what are the kind of character or logical or socioeconomic differences, what distinguishes the people who decided to go along versus the people who said, no way?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo first of all, to be clear, there are no sociological differences. I mean, we are talking about elite people. We\u2019re talking about educated sophisticated people who were not damaged by Poland\u2019s post-communist resurgence. Quite the contrary. I hesitate to generalize because one of the things I liked about this book is that, unlike as in writing columns, I didn\u2019t really have to generalize. I could just focus on a few people. But very often in Poland, a lot of the people that I\u2019m talking about are people who, for one reason or another, became dissatisfied. I mean, so for example, in Poland with the post-communist state. And sometimes they were dissatisfied for political reasons, and often they were dissatisfied for personal reasons. So they personally had not prospered to the degree to which they felt they should have done.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nAnd so there is a quality of resentment, a feeling that the wrong people have risen to power, the wrong people are achieving prominence. Our business class is not the right kind of people. So there\u2019s a feeling that the wrong people have somehow won or are somehow in charge. And you can look back through history, and the sort of classic profile of the revolutionary is somebody who\u2019s part of the elite, but not on top. So look at Lenin. Lenin came from the Russian aristocracy, but the lowest rung of the aristocracy, right? And then his family even dropped out of the aristocracy after his brother was sentenced as a revolutionary, and he has fantastic resentment, even though he\u2019s not from the working class. He\u2019s not the poorest part of the country, but he has this feeling of resentment against Russia\u2019s rulers. OK, the Russian revolution is a more complicated story than that. It wasn\u2019t all about Lenin\u2019s personal psychosis. I don\u2019t want to keep going with that analogy. I\u2019m just saying that if you do look back, you do find that a lot of radicals often fit that profile. And I think even in the U.S., Laura Ingraham, who I write about at some length, isn\u2019t somebody that I do know that well. She doesn\u2019t really count as a friend. She was just somebody I met a few times. And we have some mutual friends and so on, but I\u2019m not close to her. But she is somebody who I know was always very resentful of the fact that her achievements weren\u2019t more recognized. So she also has that quality of resenting the elite, which she is also somehow part of. I mean, to say that she\u2019s not an elite is ridiculous. I mean, she\u2019s \u2014\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nDid you ever read her book about what an elite is?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI read several of her books. I can\u2019t remember.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nShe wrote this book in 2003 where she basically defines elitism as a state of mind that sort of has nothing to do\u2014\n\nanne applebaum\n\nWith your actual\u2014\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\n\u2014with class.\n\nanne applebaum\n\n\u2014class. Yeah, right. Right.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo it\u2019s kind of this bizarre fantasmagorical version of elitism in which a person with the right politics can never, by definition, be part of the elite.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nRight. So she has defined herself as somebody \u2014 even though she\u2019s extremely wealthy, television presenter with millions of social media followers and a huge fan base, and a large house and all that, she nevertheless defines herself as being somehow anti-elite, which is, of course, ridiculous.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nIf you\u2019re asking what people like that have in common, this is often it. There\u2019s some element of resentment or a feeling of outsiderism.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut do you think she\u2019s changed? Because in your book, you sort of associate her with this optimistic post-Cold War milieu of Reaganism and people who felt like we won, and now we\u2019re going to go on to keep winning. Whereas when I look at her history, I mean, starting with Dartmouth where she is the editor of this school newspaper with Dinesh D\u2019Souza, where they become famous for trying to humiliate gay students by sending an undercover reporter to the gay student group\u2019s meeting and publishing excerpts of things that people talked about. Her book in 2003 is obviously extremely resentful and nationalist. I guess I don\u2019t see a Laura Ingraham that was at one point different or better than the one that we see today.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nNo, I\u2019m not sure that Laura Ingraham was ever different or better. Her views about the world have certainly changed. I mean, she has a much different view of American foreign policy. She has a different analysis of American history than she once had. I\u2019m not intimate with her. I don\u2019t know her well enough to tell you exactly all the components of it, although I tease it apart a little bit in the book. But that she was an anti-communist at a time when other people on the left weren\u2019t is true. And so I probably gave her more credit for that than she deserved in the \u201880s and \u201890s. But to me, that was a really important quality, and it remained an important quality for me for a long time.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, I want to say something very cynical and ask something very cynical, but these last years have made me pretty cynical, which is, you used the verb \u201cprospered\u201d before. You were just talking about Laura Ingraham\u2019s views have changed. I find myself wondering as we talk about resentment as a motivating factor, the size of the chip on someone\u2019s shoulder, to what extent do they actually have convictions that change in ideologies, or are they just grabbing onto the winning formula that puts them on the top of the team or in the winner\u2019s circle or make sure that they prosper? I mean, are they just kind of choosing horses rather than, in fact, evolving ideologically?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSome of them. I mean, some of them are deeply cynical. So one other person who I talk about in the book who won\u2019t be familiar to American listeners is a Hungarian woman called Maria Schmidt, whom I suspect of deep and profound cynicism. She\u2019s somebody who has a number of both business and political interests in Hungary, and she\u2019s made great efforts to stay on the right side of the current ruling party and is now one of their chief propagandists, even though I know that in earlier eras she was more doubtful about them. And I suspect her of being profoundly cynical. So one of the things that I tried to argue in the book is that, again, the human personality is very complex, and people can be motivated by more than one thing. And some people are motivated by an idealism or an ideology or politics, and some people are motivated by personal ambition. Some people are motivated by resentment. Some people are motivated by the pleasure in seeing their enemies squirm. And some people are, as you say, profoundly cynical, and sometimes those qualities dominate at different moments. I mean, I actually end the book with this discussion of cynicism and nihilism, and I say that this is the really dangerous sentiment for liberal democracy is that. Because once people become cynical and once they think it\u2019s all a game and it doesn\u2019t matter who wins, then you do begin to lose the virtue of the state, and then you really are open for all kinds of extreme politics. But yeah, I mean, are they cynical? Some of them really are, yes.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut there\u2019s also a relationship, right, between kind of doubt and fanaticism. If you\u2019re going to insist on something that on some level you know it not to be true, it\u2019s likely to make you more histrionic and more sort of uncompromising.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI think there\u2019s a quote in the book that I\u2019m not going to be able to recite to you off the top of my head, but it\u2019s a quote actually that comes from a guy who was a young communist in Poland in the 1940s, Jacek Trzynadel. And he described in a famous memoir that he wrote years later, he described what it felt like to be talking to a crowd of people. People are shouting and cheering, and he was lecturing the crowd whatever, support our Marxist state. I mean, I\u2019m just making up what he said. I don\u2019t remember the exact thing. And he writes, the more I was shouting, the more I was doubting what I was saying. Did I really believe what I was shouting? And I felt I had to shout louder not just to convince the crowd, but to convince myself.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nI think I was talking a little bit about something else, which is just rank opportunism. We were talking moments ago about Laura Ingraham. One of her Fox News colleagues Tucker Carlson, if you go back and you listen to Tucker Carlson 15, 20 years ago, he doesn\u2019t sound exactly or really all that much like he sounds now. And his voice has evolved in relationship to where he\u2019s gotten the largest audience, the most traction, the most power. And Donald Trump, I mean, does any one of us really believe that Donald Trump has an intrinsic and abiding ideology versus a set of hunches and instincts about which direction to turn in to maximize the adulation and the purchase on power?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut actually, Frank, I mean, I would say I actually think that racism is pretty deep in Donald Trump and is as close to a sincere belief as he\u2019s possible of holding.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo actually, Tucker Carlson, who I didn\u2019t write about, but is probably a better example, as you say, of somebody who has changed very profoundly. David Frum has a thesis about Carlson, which is that it was because what he really, really, really, really always wanted to do was be on television and be good at television. He tried various television projects, and they kept failing. And then finally, he hit on the formula that would win him millions of fans, and that was this kind of strange racist, nationalist, nativist language that is designed to appeal to mobs of like thinkers in America and that that was what finally brought him fame and glory, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s sticking with it. And so, yes, that would be an example of really sort of pure opportunism and a kind of nihilism. And that, as I say, is one of the enemies of good politics.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nBut where would you put Trump, Anne? Is Trump more Tucker or more Lenin? [GOLDBERG AND APPLEBAUM LAUGH]\n\nanne applebaum\n\nActually, a bit of \u2014 [LAUGHS] golly, that\u2019s not a question I ever thought I was going to have to answer.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nIt\u2019s not a question I ever thought I\u2019d ask. [BOTH LAUGH]\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo, I mean, actually, you can see elements of both. I mean, think about it. Trump is somebody who he\u2019s very rich. He\u2019s on the front page of tabloids. And yet, is he ever really accepted by the New York elite who he resents? Is he accepted by the real movers and shakers, the real bankers and businessmen in New York? Do they see him as a real player? I mean, no, they don\u2019t. I mean, for all I know, he may be deeply resentful of the people who look down on him because he was vulgar and so on. So he may well fit into that sort of, in that sense, the Leninist category, and at the same time be someone who, as Michelle said, is somebody who just has this instinct for kind of negative publicity. He understands how to move crowds and how to appeal to really base instincts. So he\u2019s somebody you can see both of those aspects in.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNow, one of the things that I think is really valuable about your book is its kind of international scope. So it\u2019s not just about what happened to the Republican Party. But to me, one of the questions that keeps \u2014 this may be a provincial question, but compared to maybe if Hungary is the worst case scenario out of all of the countries that you\u2019re writing about in this book, possibly followed by Poland, these are both countries where, as you write about, there\u2019s sort of a conspiracy at the very center of the government. Where do you see the United States on that trajectory? How far are we from Poland, or how far are we from Victor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo this may sound very bizarre, and I accept that it\u2019s my own weird provincialism, and it\u2019s my strange perspective as an American who lives at least part of the time in Poland. I think the United States and Poland are really similar in the sense that I do think that Trump came to power also on the back of a conspiracy that all of us \u2014 including me, but also many other people \u2014 underrated, which was the conspiracy of birtherism. And it\u2019s now sort of forgotten because so many things have happened, that this was the moment when he really broke into national politics was by being the kind of the loudest spokesman for birtherism. And what was birtherism? It was the argument that the president of the United States is illegitimate. He\u2019s not even American. And this argument had a tremendous amount of power and was believed by an enormous number of people. I saw a statistic once, it\u2019s between 20 percent and 30 percent of Americans believed this to be true. Now, think about what that means. If the president is illegitimate, that means that everybody \u2014 the media, the courts, the Congress, the civil service \u2014 everybody is lying to you. So the entire state is covering up this fact that the president is an illegal outsider and should not be president at all. If you believe that, OK, then you are ready for all kinds of radical changes and all kinds of radical politics because you have come to doubt all of the institutions of your democracy.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOh, that\u2019s really interesting. So that creates much more of a kind of \u2014 I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve thought before that there is such a through line between birtherism and then the deep state conspiracy.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nOh, absolutely. No, no, I mean, the use of conspiracy theories and conspiracy thinking by Trump is very similar to the way this was used in Poland and where it\u2019s been used in other places. And by the way, throughout history, OK? The Bolsheviks were great conspiracy theorists. And the way in which he used it and the way in which he has consistently sought to undermine public trust in a range of institutions \u2014 the deep state, the fake news media, the judges who are really Mexicans, they\u2019re not Americans \u2014 all that language used over and over. Some of it I think he does in a calculating way and some of it is instinctive. I mean, this is genuinely, I think, probably how he sees the world. All of this has built up and amplified the existing lack of trust in American society and helped to undermine people\u2019s faith in institutions. I mean, if you think American democracy is so rotten that we had a president for eight years who wasn\u2019t even American and it was all lied to us, then you\u2019re willing to see all kinds of things overthrown. Then what do you care about the State Department being decimated or the Inspector General of the C.I.A. being fired? Why should you care? All those people, it\u2019s so obvious that all of it is corrupt. And this is something that Trumpism has in common with the way politics are done not just in Poland, but in Brazil and in many other countries.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, I ask you this because you are a student, a scholar of authoritarians and authoritarianism, and because I suspect it\u2019s a question that\u2019s on a lot of our listeners\u2019 minds. Donald Trump, let\u2019s say he loses in early November. Do you think there\u2019s a real possibility that he rejects the results? And what does that look like? And if he wins, what do you suspect the next four years look like?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo those are two different questions. I mean, first of all, I think it\u2019s almost certain that he is going to question the results. He\u2019s said so already. He\u2019s been asked point blank, will you accept the result? And he\u2019s refused to say yes. So I think that is a clear possibility. It\u2019s something everybody should be prepared for. It may be that there is a very easy solution to that if it happens, and the solution is I think Biden himself has said, well, on January the 20th, he\u2019ll walk into the White House, and the Secret Service will escort Mr. Trump out because Trump will have trouble fighting the legality of it. But that doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t cause an enormous amount of trouble or do an enormous amount of damage by campaigning around the country between November and January and saying that the election was rigged and seek once again to use conspiracy theory to move people and prepare them for some other political project still to come. And so, yes, it\u2019s possible. But I should also say that I also think it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll try to cheat in other ways. I mean, I think the attempt to undermine absentee ballots, the hints that he might undermine the work of the post office so that it couldn\u2019t deliver absentee ballots, I mean, all of that is preparing both to try and cheat and to prevent people from voting, and also to begin to make the case that the election was rigged. So it is highly possible he\u2019ll do that. Second question \u2014 well, no, sorry, your second question was about what if he wins.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nIf he wins, is that it? Are we on a fast track, an express train to authoritarianism?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo if he wins, I mean, the main difference between Trump\u2019s first term and Trump\u2019s second term will be the kinds of people working for him. Because if you remember, in the early part of his presidency, there were still people working for him who believed they were there to do something good and they were there to protect the institutions of the United States. And although I\u2019ve criticized James Mattis, I do accept that he thought that what he was doing there was making sure that the army was OK and that elements of U.S. foreign policy, like our relationship with allies, were maintained. And a number of people who worked for Trump in the beginning had that commitment to the institutions and to democracy. In Trump\u2019s second term, there will be no such people. And so the government, the institutions will be run by people who are intent on destroying what they can and who will do so rather aggressively. And yes, I do think that would cause an enormous crisis in American democracy.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nThe other scenario is Biden wins, Trump leaves voluntarily or is escorted out. What then happens to the authoritarian fervor that he has cultivated during his four years when he\u2019s out of office?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo this is a really interesting question, and one that I have been talking to people about. Most think that \u2014 and these are mostly ex-Republicans, but people who know the party quite well \u2014 most people think that everything depends on how he loses. So if he loses by a lot, if it\u2019s a wipeout, if the Republican Party loses the Senate and if it loses even more seats in the House, then it is possible that a part of the party leadership will say we\u2019re right, that was a big disaster, and that was a really bad idea. And Trumpism was a road to nowhere, and it\u2019s a road to an ever-shrinking base. And therefore, there will be an election or an argument inside the party, and a new kind of leader will be chosen. And then as somebody said to me recently, and then there\u2019s at least a chance that we get rid of this authoritarian or we push to the fringes this authoritarian streak in the Republican Party. It doesn\u2019t mean that we will, but it means that then there\u2019s a chance. If the election is very close, on the other hand, if Trump loses very slightly, if the Republicans retain the Senate, and if the party still feels that this kind of rhetoric and this kind of language is a winning ticket, then the next presidential candidate may well be Tucker Carlson or Don Jr. [BRUNI LAUGHS] or Ivanka or someone who \u2014\n\nfrank bruni\n\nSo if it\u2019s Tom Cotton, we\u2019re lucky, right?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nIf it\u2019s Tom Cotton, you\u2019re lucky.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nThat\u2019s actually \u2014 [APPLEBAUM LAUGHS]\n\nanne applebaum\n\nOr Mike Pompeo. I mean \u2014\n\nfrank bruni\n\nUgh.\n\nanne applebaum\n\n\u2014 there\u2019s a range of people who will be competing for the role of the next and possibly more efficient and more intelligent Trumpist leader. And so then we are in a real national conundrum because then we have one political party which is not dedicated to playing by the rules of the game, and then the kind of polarization that we\u2019ve had will continue and get worse. And then we will find ourselves in the position of having every four years a kind of electoral moment of crisis.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo obviously, a lot of these trends that we\u2019re talking about in other countries predate the election of Donald Trump. But I\u2019m curious how you think the \u2014 I mean, collapse isn\u2019t the right word, but the kind of damage incurred to the ideal of liberal democracy in America has empowered authoritarianism in other countries and how the sort of fate of this election will then\u2014 the echoes that will have in other countries that have basically argued that liberal democracy has failed, that it was a joke, that its time is over.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo the election of Donald Trump, the re-election of Donald Trump, would have an enormous negative impact around the world, and it would absolutely empower other authoritarians, both sitting ones, whether in Russia or in China, for that matter, or in the Middle East, as well as aspiring ones in other countries that are current democracies. And this is both by the power of example. Trump and his language are quoted and imitated by people all over the world. I mean, for example, his use of the expression \u201cfake news\u201d to undermine the media is one that has been picked up and repeated by dozens of other authoritarian leaders or would-be authoritarian leaders. I mean, the other part of the story is that the authoritarian right, the new radical right around the world has deep links. There are deep financial links. There are deep links, kind of organic links on social media. These groups of people speak to one another. They share one another\u2019s memes. They communicate in different ways across borders. And the influence of the American alt-right on the European far right or the international alt-right is quite profound and vice versa. I think they influence one another. And there is no question that the re-election of Donald Trump would embolden and motivate those different groups who, as I say, are speaking to one another all the time anyway and help them propagate their ideas further.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, can I ask you a meta question, so to speak? In the very title of your book Twilight of Democracy and I think sort of the subtext of a lot of the discussion that we\u2019re all having here today is this notion that the trend line is away from democracy. The trend line is toward, very scarily, authoritarianism. I just want to kind of play devil\u2019s advocate maybe in a very hopeful vein. Poland just had an election. I believe\u2014 you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 was the closest election since the end of communism. And in fact, the authoritarian government barely won. You go back to 2016. Trump got almost 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton did in the popular vote. He won only after Russian interference, only after a late in the game assist from Jim Comey, and possibly also because so many people were so convinced the outcome was predetermined in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor that they didn\u2019t rouse themselves to vote. And since then, almost every metric, almost every measure, almost every election has suggested the limits of Trump\u2019s appeal. Is it possible that what we\u2019re seeing in Poland and what we\u2019re seeing in America is, at the end of the day, a blip, he asked hopefully.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI mean, maybe. I, too, hope that that\u2019s the correct interpretation. And our country and other countries have overcome even worse crises before. I mean, the Civil War was a pretty big blip on the history of American democracy. It was a moment of total collapse, and somehow we nevertheless recovered from that with some caveats. I think one of the reasons I wrote the book and one of the reasons I concluded it the way I did is that what I don\u2019t want is for Americans to become complacent, for us to say, well, our democracy is so great and so strong and our Constitution is so fantastic, and we\u2019re a superpower. I don\u2019t have to try that hard to make sure that everything goes well in our country, and it\u2019s all going to go back to how it was eventually. And anyway, Poland is far away, and they are central Europeans, and they have nothing to do with us. I mean, I really believe that it is that conviction of inevitability which was the big mistake, I should say, of my entourage or my milieu, my friends in the \u201890s. There was a kind of complacency that now that we\u2019re on this road to democracy, nothing can take us back. Because that is wrong. Countries do reverse themselves, and they do cease to be democracies. And we are going through a really extraordinary moment of technological and informational and demographic and social change, and changes make society very volatile and all kinds of outcomes are possible. And I don\u2019t want people to be complacent or certain that we will somehow go back to everything being the way it was before, and you don\u2019t have to really do anything about it or worry about it. because it\u2019s that feeling of inevitability that turned out to be wrong.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I think we will end it there. And even though we have some disagreements about the nature of pre-Trump conservatism, it was a pleasure to read \u201cThe Twilight of Democracy.\u201d It\u2019s a fascinating book, and I\u2019m thrilled that you came on the show. Thank you so much.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, thank you so much for your time and your thoughtfulness.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nOh, thanks for talking to me. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnd we\u2019re back. Michelle, what did you think?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I think that she\u2019s extraordinarily brilliant obviously. And it\u2019s often funny when you disagree with someone on Twitter in a column, and then you end up talking and you find out you agree more than you might have thought. And I should say that Anne Applebaum is someone who her willingness to kind of call out authoritarianism on the right certainly didn\u2019t begin with Trump. Something I probably should have brought up is that she was at one time a big fan of John McCain, who refused to vote for him, I think very honorably, in 2008 because he put Sarah Palin on the ticket, right? And Sarah Palin\u2019s rise to prominence was in a lot of ways a premonition of what we\u2019re living through now. And so one of the things that is so interesting about this moment is how you end up being in political coalitions with people that you never could have imagined, right? It\u2019s such a reminder of how long life is. That it would have been hard enough for me to imagine maybe being on the same side as Anne Applebaum in 2000 or 2003, never mind David Frum and Bill Kristol. But one of the things I wrote in my piece is that I think a lot of people on the left are very, very suspicious of Never Trump conservatives, and I really admire them because they\u2019ve really sacrificed something to stand up to him. And they\u2019ve sacrificed more than I\u2019ve had to or more than people on the left have had to just in terms of the fissuring of personal relationships, professional networks, right? I mean, I think it\u2019s really not easy to turn your back on the social and political world that you\u2019ve lived your whole life in.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nWhat you just described or what you just talked about is actually where I get my hope during these dark times. And what I mean by that is, you\u2019re right, you and Anne Applebaum agree more than you disagree, and that becomes clear when you talk with each other, and you have made temporary whatever kind of partnership with people whom you didn\u2019t expect to. I think that if I\u2019m going to be an optimist, one thing that could come out of all of this \u2014 and our conversation with Anne reacquainted me with this optimism \u2014 is that we can focus on what unites us more than what divides us. Understanding what a threat Trump is, being so deeply offended by some of the divisions he\u2019s exploited and the ways he\u2019s governed has reminded so many people from various points of the political spectrum of what they have in common and of how overlapping their fundamental values are in so many ways. Don\u2019t you think?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI guess, but I really wonder if that\u2019s more of an elite phenomenon, right? That sort of people who make their living by kind of arguing and writing in the search for truth and good faith argumentation are sort of necessarily in this moment on the same side. Instead of kind of politics\u2014 I\u2019ve written this before. Instead of politics being a war of ideas, the people who takes ideas seriously are aside in politics. I think if you look at the country as a whole, I don\u2019t see how you look out at America right now and say that this is a country where people are more aware of what unites them than divides them. I mean, to me, it looks like a country that\u2019s coming apart at the seams.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nI mean, it looks and feels that way. And yet, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just an elite phenomenon. I mean, if I flash back over the last couple of years, once Trump had been in office for a while and the offenses had mounted and mounted and mounted, the number of times somebody in a store, in a fast food restaurant, wherever, has kind of set an aside, an aside of disgust that lets me know that they\u2019ve developed the same reservations or deep concerns that someone writing op-ed pieces and simply using a different vocabulary is expressing. I mean, that happens all the time. And I look more recently \u2014 and I think this has been so fascinating and hopeful \u2014 I look at the polls regarding how Americans feel about Black Lives Matter and where that puts them in opposition to Trump, and I see an overwhelming majority of Americans coming together with the same idea of justice and rejecting Donald Trump. And \u2014\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNo, I think you\u2019re right that Donald Trump has created \u2014 and I think Jemele wrote about this, right, that Donald Trump has created, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a silent majority, but he\u2019s definitely created a fairly solid anti-Trump majority.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAgain, when I want to wear my optimist hat, I think Donald Trump in the long run, if things turn out better and not worse, I think Donald Trump has shown us who we don\u2019t want to be. At the end of the conversation with Anne, we talked in what I found to be a very fascinating manner about various scenarios. Trump barely loses. Trump loses big. Trump wins. Beyond all of those, there\u2019s a scenario where he loses, we move on. And again, this is my hope. This is me at my most hopeful and optimistic. Call me Pollyanna. We remember what Donald Trump did to us. We remember what he showed us in terms of the kind of America we don\u2019t want to be. And maybe we\u2019re the better for it.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I think that\u2019s certainly a possibility, right? I mean, if you look at all the reforms that you saw after Richard Nixon, I mean, most of them stood up fairly well until Donald Trump dismantled them. But there was not just this huge wave after, this huge Democratic wave that followed Nixon\u2019s resignation, but a whole flurry of lawmaking to try to solidify accountability, solidify transparency, solidify democratic institutions. I think it\u2019s going to be really, really important that people keep pushing on that. When Barack Obama first became president, there were people who wanted some sort of accountability for the people who had both misled the country into war under George W. Bush and also the people responsible for the financial crisis. And I understand why Obama, facing all these interlocking crises, thought that it was the time to sort of look forward rather than backward. But I think that was a mistake in retrospect, and it would be a fatal mistake if, inshallah, Biden becomes president. I think it will be really important to have something\u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, if it\u2019s a commission in the Justice Department \u2014 to sort of expose both the kind of instances of corruption and lawlessness that we maybe half know about. And I\u2019m sure there are a lot that we don\u2019t know about, right? I\u2019m sure there are a lot of utterly corrupt phone calls with foreign leaders as bad as the one with the president of Ukraine that we just haven\u2019t heard about. And so I think it\u2019ll be really, really important to figure out the places where norms need to be replaced by laws.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nI suspect we will be excavating the muck of the Trump administration for decades to come. I just hope that excavation begins sooner rather than later. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] But we should probably wrap it up there, Michelle. It\u2019s just you and me this week, which means 50/50 chance that you\u2019re going to be the one doing the recommendation. And I just tossed a coin. Heads it\u2019s you. What\u2019s your recommendation this week?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I am going to recommend \u2014 it\u2019s not a new book. I\u2019m going to recommend an old book that I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot recently and that I recently re-read, Milan Kundera\u2019s \u201cThe Joke.\u201d So I don\u2019t know about you, but I have a lot of these books that I feel like have been really formative, and yet at the same time I can barely remember. But I decided to reread \u201cThe Joke\u201d recently because we\u2019ve been, or I\u2019ve been at any rate, embroiled in this discussion over cancel culture, which even though I don\u2019t like the phrase cancel culture, it seems somewhat inescapable, and sort of what it means to be publicly shamed, what it means for a ideological movement to enforce its boundaries. And when I see people kind of cast out, I often think of this book.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nWhat is the storyline of \u201cThe Joke\u201c?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOK, so the storyline of \u201cThe Joke\u201d is there is a young communist in Czechoslovakia in the \u201840s, a very ardent communist, but somebody with a sort of slightly ironic temperament, who has a crush on this girl who is kind of earnest to a fault. And he teases her by sending her this jokey postcard \u2014 hold on, I\u2019ll just get the actual line because I have it underlined here. [PAGES FLIPPING] So he teases her by sending her this jokey postcard that says, \u201cOptimism is the opium of the people. A healthy atmosphere stinks of stupidity. Long live Trotsky.\u201d And this postcard, this joke, ends up completely derailing his life. He\u2019s drummed out of the party, drummed out of the university. He\u2019s sent to go work in the mines. So in some ways, this is not at all comparable to what we talk about when we talk about cancellation, right? Because the sort of horror of it is that it has the power of the state behind it. And sometimes I think that people my age and older, those of us who grew up on Milan Kundera and books like it, there are certain rhetorical modes that signal to us authoritarianism. And we see them on Twitter and maybe overreact because what was so frightening about them was that they had the power of the state behind them. And yet at the same time, I think he sort of really captures the emotional experience, or what I imagine to be the emotional experience, of being sort of drummed out of a movement that you identify with. Because the significant thing about Ludvik is that he really is a communist, and so he really does identify with the people who are casting him out. He doesn\u2019t really want to be a dissident. I\u2019ll just quote this line: \u201cI came to realize that there was no power capable of changing the image of my person lodged somewhere in the supreme court of human destinies. But this image, even though it bore no resemblance to me, was much more real than my actual self, that I was its shadow and not it mine.\u201d I think that line captures some of what happens when people become reduced to either the worst thing that they\u2019ve ever said or someone\u2019s impression of the worst thing that they ever said.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nIt\u2019s so interesting to hear you describe it, Michelle, because one of the more celebrated novels to come out in the last six months and one of the novels I most recently read is called \u201cA Burning.\u201d I\u2019m going to probably mispronounce the author\u2019s name, for which I apologize, but her name is Megha Majumdar, and it\u2019s set in India. And I\u2019m realizing how timeless, what stamina the story you\u2019re describing from \u201cThe Joke\u201d has. It is, again, about someone who, with a single communication, miscommunication, call it what you will, is branded forevermore and becomes a convenient object of analysis, demonization, caricature, whatever, for the society around her. So this is clearly a story that, regardless of epoch of decade, speaks to certain eternal verities of human nature.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI had heard of that book, but I hadn\u2019t realized that that was what it was about.

Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts who mounted a largely symbolic challenge to Mr. Trump in the Republican primaries this year, said on Thursday that the president\u2019s tweet was a sign that Mr. Trump was panicked and unmoored.

There was no immediate call to the barricades, or renewed push from Democrats for presidential impeachment.

In March, Gov. John Bel Edwards and Secretary of State R. Kyle Ardoin did just that. (In fact, they later postponed the primary election for a second time, buying more time for the state to prepare to hold its vote amid the pandemic.)\n\nHave federal officials considered moving a general election in the past?\n\nIt was reported in 2004 that some Bush administration officials had discussed putting in place a method of postponing a federal election in the event of a terrorist attack. But that idea fizzled quickly, and Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, said that the United States had held \u201celections in this country when we were at war, even when we were in civil war. And we should have the elections on time.\u201d\n\nWhat about the procedures for voting in the November election?\n\nWhile the date of the presidential election is set by federal law, the procedures for voting are generally controlled at the state level.\n\nThat\u2019s why the nation has such a complicated patchwork of voting regulations, with some states allowing early and absentee voting; some permitting voting by mail or same-day voter registration; others requiring certain kinds of identification for voters; and many states doing few or none of those things.\n\nDemocrats included $3.6 billion in their latest coronavirus aid package to help states administer their elections safely during the pandemic. Republicans did not include any such funding in the proposal they rolled out this week.\n\nSeveral states have tried to make it easier for voters to use mail-in ballots this year, helping them to avoid going to polling places on Election Day.

Except this time, there were some cameras there. This time, the world saw what happened, bore witness to Black Americans who were asking for nothing more than to be treated like other Americans. Who were not asking for special treatment, just the equal treatment promised to them a century before, and almost another century before that.\n\nWhen John woke up, and checked himself out of the hospital, he would make sure the world saw a movement that was, in the words of Scripture, \u201chard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.\u201d They returned to Brown Chapel, a battered prophet, bandages around his head, and he said more marchers will come now.

And their words reached the White House \u2014 and Lyndon Johnson, son of the South, said \u201cWe shall overcome,\u201d and the Voting Rights Act was signed into law.\n\nThe life of John Lewis was, in so many ways, exceptional. It vindicated the faith in our founding, redeemed that faith; that most American of ideas; that idea that any of us ordinary people without rank or wealth or title or fame can somehow point out the imperfections of this nation, and come together, and challenge the status quo, and decide that it is in our power to remake this country that we love until it more closely aligns with our highest ideals. What a radical ideal. What a revolutionary notion. This idea that any of us, ordinary people, a young kid from Troy can stand up to the powers and principalities and say no this isn\u2019t right, this isn\u2019t true, this isn\u2019t just. We can do better. On the battlefield of justice, Americans like John, Americans like the Reverends Lowery and C.T. Vivian, two other patriots that we lost this year, liberated all of us that many Americans came to take for granted.\n\nAmerica was built by people like them. America was built by John Lewises. He as much as anyone in our history brought this country a little bit closer to our highest ideals. And someday, when we do finish that long journey toward freedom; when we do form a more perfect union \u2014 whether it\u2019s years from now, or decades, or even if it takes another two centuries \u2014 John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America.\n\nAnd yet, as exceptional as John was, here\u2019s the thing: John never believed that what he did was more than any citizen of this country can do. I mentioned in the statement the day John passed, the thing about John was just how gentle and humble he was. And despite this storied, remarkable career, he treated everyone with kindness and respect because it was innate to him \u2014 this idea that any of us can do what he did if we are willing to persevere.\n\nHe believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage, that in all of us there is a longing to do what\u2019s right, that in all of us there is a willingness to love all people, and to extend to them their God-given rights to dignity and respect. So many of us lose that sense. It\u2019s taught out of us. We start feeling as if, in fact, that we can\u2019t afford to extend kindness or decency to other people. That we\u2019re better off if we are above other people and looking down on them, and so often that\u2019s encouraged in our culture. But John always saw the best in us. And he never gave up, and never stopped speaking out because he saw the best in us. He believed in us even when we didn\u2019t believe in ourselves. As a Congressman, he didn\u2019t rest; he kept getting himself arrested. As an old man, he didn\u2019t sit out any fight; he sat in, all night long, on the floor of the United States Capitol. I know his staff was stressed.\n\nBut the testing of his faith produced perseverance. He knew that the march is not yet over, that the race is not yet won, that we have not yet reached that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character. He knew from his own life that progress is fragile; that we have to be vigilant against the darker currents of this country\u2019s history, of our own history, with their whirlpools of violence and hatred and despair that can always rise again.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/obama-eulogy-john-lewis-full-transcript.html", "author": ["The New York Times"]}, {"title": "A Quarter of Bangladesh Is Flooded.

Instead of continuing the $600 weekly payments, however, Republicans proposed cutting the sum to $200 a week, through the end of the year. That would replace only a portion of the income of the average unemployed worker, which is reasonable in normal times; it encourages people to find jobs. But in the midst of a pandemic, with few jobs available, the benefit cut is an act of pointless cruelty.\n\nDemocrats refused to accept the proposal, and Republicans refused to do anything more.\n\nThe result: More than 20 million unemployed Americans are about to lose $600 a week.

The balance of power within families has shifted dramatically over the last 50 years, mainly because of money. The transformation began when the country\u2019s post-World War II economic boom hit the killer recession of the 1970s, and everyone began to realize that a whole lot of the families of the future would not be able to afford a middle-class lifestyle unless the wives kept working.\n\nThe women\u2019s movement combined with the hard facts of the economy created a world in which almost no one envisioned young women with a distinctly different wage-earning future from men. I\u2019ll never forget a visit I made to a community college in Connecticut, back around 1980. I was invited for some reason to speak to a class of young men, and I asked them to describe for me their ideal mate. There were a few polite murmurs about a good sense of humor and fine moral character \u2014 then someone called out, \u201cAnd a good earner!\u201d I cannot tell you how enthusiastic the room became over the \u201cgood earner\u201d qualification.\n\nIt took professional politicians quite a while to notice there was a change going on. Then in 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated then-President Jimmy Carter, it became clear the country had moved on to a whole new political wave. Analysis of the final tallies showed that both sexes favored Reagan, but the women split very narrowly while the men went Republican 55 percent to 36 percent. The gender gap was born, and it really turned into a canyon in 1996, when Bill Clinton won the women\u2019s vote by a wide margin, while men narrowly favored Bob Dole.\n\nThese days, women go to the polls more faithfully than men, and they are more likely to vote Democratic. That doesn\u2019t mean they always win. In 2000, women favored Al Gore for president over George W. Bush, 54-44 percent, while the men went for Bush, 54-43. In 2016, the male voters gave us Donald Trump in an election where the gender gap yawned at 11 points.\n\nBut the power is there.

The fact that casinos are treated more generously than movie theaters, concerts, museums and churches handed Alliance Defending Freedom its opening. \u201cThe Free Exercise clause protects the exercise of religion,\u201d the church\u2019s Supreme Court appeal began, adding that \u201cno constitutional provision protects the right to gamble at casinos, eat at restaurants, or frolic at indoor amusement parks.\u201d\n\nThis statement of the case obviously appealed to Justice Alito, who began his 11-page dissent with this observation: \u201cThe Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion. It says nothing about the freedom to play craps or blackjack, to feed tokens into a slot machine, or to engage in any other game of chance.\u201d He added, \u201cBut the governor of Nevada apparently has different priorities.\u201d The state, he said, \u201cblatantly discriminates against houses of worship.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s assume that opening the casinos was a political and economic necessity for the state. But finding a constitutional violation requires more than clever rhetoric. It requires a very precise chain of analysis, a hard climb that Justice Alito failed to make. His burden was to show not simply that churches are limited to 50 people and casinos aren\u2019t, but that the state singled churches out for onerous treatment without reason. Federal District Judge Richard Boulware II, in rejecting the church\u2019s request for an injunction, offered the analysis that Justice Alito\u2019s opinion skipped over:\n\nOther secular entities and activities similar in nature to church services have been subject to similar or more restrictive limitations on their operations. The court notes that church services consist of activities, such as sermons and corporate worship, that are comparable in terms of large numbers of people gathering for an extended period of time to lectures, museums, movie theaters, specified trade/technical schools, nightclubs and concerts. All of these latter activities are also subject to the 50-person cap or remain banned altogether.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s casinos that Nevada singles out for special treatment, not religion.\n\nInvoking the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause, Justice Alito also claimed that the state was discriminating against churches on the basis of their \u201cviewpoint.\u201d \u201cReligion counts as a viewpoint,\u201d he wrote, a sentence I found baffling. Isn\u2019t belief in public health a viewpoint? In any event, he went on: \u201cCompare the directive\u2019s treatment of casino entertainment and church services. Both involve expression, but the directive favors the secular expression in casino shows over the religious expression in houses of worship.\u201d\n\nThe contorted effort to shoehorn this dispute into standard free-speech doctrine was only a prelude to a further charge: that Governor Sisolak \u201chas favored certain speakers over others.\u201d It seems that the governor supported and even took part in a protest after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, a protest that drew more than 50 people and yet was allowed to take place. \u201cRespecting some First Amendment rights is not a shield for violating others,\u201d Justice Alito wrote. In other words, the governor of Nevada is not only anti-religious but a hypocrite as well.\n\nWhy does any of this matter? After all, Justice Alito\u2019s opinion attracted only two other votes. (Justice Gorsuch filed a separate one-paragraph dissent, pithily observing that \u201cthere is no world in which the Constitution permits Nevada to favor Caesars Palace over Calvary Chapel.\u201d)\n\nI think it matters because rhetoric like Justice Alito\u2019s, by design or not, inevitably places the Supreme Court where it least belongs and where it is least qualified to be, at the center of a national debate over how best to protect the American public from a deadly pandemic. It\u2019s beyond dispute that public health has become politicized to a degree that would have been unimaginable just six months ago. Does the court really want to become a part of that politicization by opening its doors to a battle not its own? That even a minority of justices would seize this moment to advance their religious agenda, especially given that agenda\u2019s nearly unqualified success in recent years, is deeply unsettling.\n\n(I\u2019ve been fascinated that some liberal commentators found the dissenting opinions persuasive and the case a close one. I understand the impulse not to appear unduly antagonistic toward religion, but I think that generosity toward the religious claim here loses sight of the broader context in which the dissenting justices were writing.)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/supreme-court-religion-coronavirus.html", "author": ["Linda Greenhouse"]}, {"title": "The Mysterious Life of Birds Who Never Come Down", "text": "And they are doing more. As Dokter and his colleagues write, migratory birds orient themselves through a complex of interacting compass mechanisms. During vesper flights, swifts have access to them all. At this panoptic height, they can see the scattered patterns of the stars overhead, and at the same time they can calibrate their magnetic compasses, getting their bearings according to the light-polarization patterns that are strongest and clearest in twilit skies. Stars, wind, polarized light, magnetic cues, the distant stacks of clouds a hundred miles out, clear cold air, and below them the hush of a world tilting toward sleep or waking toward dawn. What they are doing is flying so high that they can work out exactly where they are, to know what they should do next. They\u2019re quietly, perfectly, orienting themselves.\n\nThe behavioral ecologist Cecilia Nilsson and her team have discovered that swifts don\u2019t make these flights alone. They ascend as flocks every evening before singly drifting down, while in the morning they fly up alone and return to earth together. To orient themselves correctly, to make the right decisions, they need to pay attention not only to the cues of the world around them but also to one another. Nilsson and her colleagues hypothesize that swifts on their vesper flights are working according to what is called the many-wrongs principle. That is, they\u2019re averaging all their individual assessments in order to reach the best navigational decision. If you\u2019re in a flock, decisions about what to do next are improved if you exchange information with those around you. We can speak to one another; what swifts do is pay attention to what other swifts are doing. And in the end it can be as simple as this: They follow one another.\n\nThe realm of my own life is the quotidian, the everyday, where I sleep and eat and work and think. Until now, I\u2019ve been privileged enough to experience it as a place of relative quiet. It\u2019s a space of rising and falling hopes and worries, costs and benefits, plans and distractions, and it can batter and distract me, just as high winds and rainfall send swifts off-course. Sometimes it\u2019s a hard place to be, but it\u2019s home to me.\n\nThinking about swifts has made me think more carefully about the ways in which I\u2019ve dealt with difficulty. When I was small, I comforted myself with thoughts of layers of rising air; later I hid myself among the whispers of recorded works of fiction, helping myself fall asleep by playing audiobooks on my phone. We all have our defenses. Some of them are self-defeating, but others are occasions for joy: the absorption of a hobby, the writing of a poem, speeding on a Harley, the slow assembly of a collection of records or shells. \u201cThe best thing for being sad,\u201d said T.H. White\u2019s Merlyn, \u201cis to learn something.\u201d As my friend Christina says, all of us have to live our lives most of the time inside the protective structures that we have built; none of us can bear too much reality. And with the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s terrifying grip on the globe, as so many of us cling desperately to the remnants of what we assumed would always be normality \u2014 sometimes in ways that put us, our loved ones and others in danger \u2014 my usual defenses against difficulty have begun to feel uncomfortably provisional and precarious.\n\nSwifts have, of late, become my fable of community, teaching us about how to make right decisions in the face of oncoming bad weather. They aren\u2019t always cresting the atmospheric boundary layer at dizzying heights; most of the time they are living below it in thick and complicated air. That\u2019s where they feed and mate and bathe and drink and are. But to find out about the important things that will affect their lives, they must go higher to survey the wider scene, and there communicate with others about the larger forces impinging on their realm.\n\nNot all of us need to make that climb, just as many swifts eschew their vesper flights because they are occupied with eggs and young \u2014 but surely some of us are required, by dint of flourishing life and the well-being of us all, to look clearly at the things that are so easily obscured by the everyday. To take time to see the things we need to set our courses toward or against; the things we need to think about to know what we should do next. To trust in careful observation and expertise, in its sharing for the common good.

More than three billion people come to Facebook or one of its family of apps on a regular basis. Credit... Jim Wilson/The New York Times Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, displayed the social network\u2019s enormous financial clout on Thursday, even as the company has dealt with regulatory scrutiny and advertiser boycotts. Facebook\u2019s revenue for the second quarter rose 11 percent from a year earlier to $18.7 billion, while profit jumped 98 percent to $5.2 billion. The results were well above analysts\u2019 estimates of $17.3 billion in revenue with a profit of $3.9 billion, according to data provided by FactSet. More than three billion people come to Facebook or one of its family of apps on a regular basis, as the services have overtaken much of the developed world. And some 2.47 billion people use one or more of Facebook\u2019s apps every day. The company said its number of monthly active users rose 12 percent from a year ago and added that it was seeing record levels of engagement and usage this year because of the coronavirus pandemic and the shelter-in-place orders around the world. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to be able to provide small businesses the tools they need to grow and be successful online during these challenging times,\u201d said Mr. Zuckerberg, who was grilled by lawmakers on Wednesday over Facebook\u2019s power. \u201cAnd we\u2019re proud that people can rely on our services to stay connected when they can\u2019t always be together in person.\u201d Facebook\u2019s earnings have long been a bright spot for the Silicon Valley company. Despite increasing scrutiny from regulators, questions about its role in subverting elections and how people use the platform to spread misinformation, users have continued coming back to its services. Because of this, advertisers have consistently spent money on the platform. But that started changing in late June when a grass-roots campaign, Stop Hate For Profit, rallied many of the top advertisers on Facebook to pull back their spending because of issues of hate speech on the site. Facebook has tried to assuage the concerns, but has made it clear that it will not change its policy about free speech on the site based on outside threats to the business. Facebook cautioned investors on Thursday that fallout from the ad boycott was noticeable in July. The company warned that greater economic turmoil from the pandemic could also eventually affect its bottom line. \u2014\n\nAmazon\u2019s earnings double as sales surge. Copied to clipboard. Americans have flocked to Amazon during the pandemic. Credit... Philip Cheung for The New York Times Buoyed by a pandemic-induced surge in online shopping, Amazon on Thursday reported record sales and profits in the latest quarter. Amazon had $88.9 billion in quarterly sales, up 40 percent from a year earlier. Profit doubled, to $5.2 billion, even though the company invested heavily to improve the safety in Amazon\u2019s warehouses. Analysts expected the company to have $81.4 billion in sales and $665 million in profit, according estimates compiled by FactSet, a financial data firm. Shares in the company jumped more than 6 percent in after-hours trading. \u201cSimply put, Covid-19, in our view, has injected Amazon with a growth hormone,\u201d Tom Forte, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson & Company, wrote in a recent note to investors. The profit came even as Amazon invested $9 billion in expanding warehouses and other capital expenditures to increase its capacity. \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s finance chief, said on a call with reporters. In April, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, told investors to expect no operating profit, and maybe even a loss, as the company planned to spend about $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses, including temporary pay increases, declines in warehouse efficiency because of social distancing and $300 million for testing its work force for the virus. \u201cIf you\u2019re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we\u2019re not thinking small,\u201d he said at the time. Amazon had been paying workers an extra $2 an hour, but that benefit expired in May. At the end of June, it announced one-time \u201cthank you\u201d bonus of $500 for full-time associates in its warehouses. But even those costs did not compare to the immense surge in demand, with online retail sales up 48 percent. As Americans have stayed home during the virus, they have flocked to online shopping. \u201cE-commerce is off the charts right now,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee whose company, CommerceIQ, helps major consumer brands manager their Amazon business. The initial shock of panic buying has subsided, but \u201cdemand is starting to stabilize, at a much higher level,\u201d he said. Mr. Olsavsky said customers returned to buying more profitable products, like clothing, versus lower-margin groceries and cleaning suppliers. One of the biggest challenges Amazon had expected was keeping up with demand, as the virus flared among its workers and the communities where they live. Mr. Olsavsky said the company was able to fulfill more orders than it had previously expected. The number of products it sold grew 57 percent, but the number of employees it had was up just 34 percent. On the call with reporters, Amazon declined to say if it would be paying its warehouse workers more in the current quarter. It said that pandemic-related expenses would fall to $2 billion in the quarter. Sales at Amazon\u2019s lucrative cloud computing business, whose customers range from major corporations to start-ups, grew 29 percent, to $10.8 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, though it was more profitable than they expected. \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlphabet\u2019s revenue drops, but beats Wall Street expectations. Copied to clipboard. A revenue decline at Alphabet, the parent of Google, came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside its search results. Credit... Jason Henry for The New York Times Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday, hurt by a slowdown in spending by advertisers. Alphabet said its revenue fell 2 percent to $38.3 billion in the second quarter compared with a year ago. The decline came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside its search results because of the coronavirus pandemic, although the company posted an increase in revenue from YouTube ads and its cloud-computing business. The results were the first time that quarterly revenue had declined in its 17 years as a publicly traded company, but Alphabet exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations for revenue and profit. Net profit totaled $6.96 billion, down 30 percent from a year ago. \u2014\n\nFord made $1.1 billion profit in the second quarter even as sales tumbled. Copied to clipboard. The coronavirus pandemic forced Ford and other automakers to close factories for nearly two months starting in March. Credit... Nolis Anderson for The New York Times Ford Motor said Thursday it earned $1.1 billion in the second quarter as a large one-time gain in the value of its investment in an autonomous driving company more than offset losses in its main business. Without the gain, from its stake in Argo AI, Ford lost $1.9 billion excluding interest and taxes. The result was better than Ford\u2019s earlier forecast of a pretax loss of $5 billion. The coronavirus pandemic forced Ford and other automakers to close factories for nearly two months starting in March. On Wednesday, General Motors said it lost $758 million in the second quarter. Ford said in a statement that it expected \u201cno further significant coronavirus-related disruptions to production\u201d in the second half of the year. But the company also said it was not expecting \u201cmeaningful change in the current economic conditions.\u201d Ford\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hackett, said in a conference call that reductions in spending and an efficient restart of production enabled the company to avoid the kind of dire results it forecast in April. In after-hours trading, Ford shares rose more than 2 percent to about $6.90. The automaker forecast that it would earn $500 million to $1.5 billion on a pretax basis in the third quarter, amid weaker demand for new vehicles, parts and services. Ford\u2019s deliveries of new vehicles fell by half to 645,000 in the second quarter largely because of the pandemic. Its auto operations lost money in every region in the world, including a $954 million setback in North America. The company used up $5.3 billion in cash in the quarter, but said it still has $39 billion on hand at the end of June. Ford recorded a gain of $3.5 billion from a transaction related to an alliance it formed with Volkswagen, which bought a stake in Argo AI. Ford has been trying for three years to streamline its operations and return to robust profits, but has come under criticism for slow progress. Mr. Hackett said Ford was pinning its hopes on new vehicles it unveiled in the last few weeks: a redesigned version of its F-150 pickup truck and a line of rugged sport-utility vehicles that will be marketed under the Bronco name. The company said it had already taken reservations for 150,000 Broncos. \u2014\n\nApple blows past expectations with surging sales and profits. Copied to clipboard. Consumers bought huge amounts of Apple products despite a global economic slowdown. Credit... Victor J. Blue for The New York Times From April through June, millions of people lost their jobs, thousands of businesses closed \u2014 and Apple made a further $11.25 billion in profits. A global economic slowdown in the second quarter did not faze one of the world\u2019s richest and most resilient companies, as people kept buying Apple devices en masse and paid the tech giant billions of dollars more for apps and services on those gadgets. Apple said its sales rose 11 percent to $59.7 billion and its profits increased 12 percent to $11.25 billion. Both figures handily beat analysts\u2019 expectations, with Wall Street having forecast declines in both areas. Revenue rose for all of Apple\u2019s product categories and in all of its geographic areas, unusual success even by Apple\u2019s lofty standards. Sales were particularly strong for iPads and Mac computers, as the public was increasingly forced to work and socialize virtually because of the pandemic. Revenue also surged in its internet-services business, which includes Apple\u2019s cut of sales from the App Store, the subject of antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe. Even the iPhone, which remains the company\u2019s biggest seller, notched a slight increase in sales for only the second time in the past seven quarters. Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview that the shift to working and learning from home had led more people to splurge on Apple\u2019s devices. \u201cOur products and services are very relevant to our customers\u2019 lives, and in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,\u201d he said. But while the pandemic has further entrenched the biggest tech companies\u2019 power, Mr. Maestri disputed the idea that it had been good for business, saying the quarter would have been even stronger without it. \u201cWe believe we\u2019ve lost several billion dollars because of the pandemic,\u201d he said. Investors have flocked to Apple\u2019s shares as a safe haven from an economic recession, pushing its stock price up about 30 percent this year to a roughly $1.67 trillion value. \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n1.43 million filed new state unemployment claims last week.

Joseph Rushmore for The New York Times The number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits totaled 1.43 million last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It was the 19th straight week that the tally exceeded one million, an unheard-of figure before the coronavirus pandemic. And it was the second weekly increase in a row after nearly four months of declines, a sign of how the rebound in cases has undercut the economy\u2019s nascent recovery. Claims for the previous week totaled 1.42 million. New claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the government\u2019s program aimed at covering freelancers, the self-employed and other workers not covered by traditional unemployment benefits, totaled 830,000, down from 975,000 the week before.

Noting that weekly claims were in the 200,000 range before the pandemic brought widespread shutdowns in March, she added, \u201cThis is unique in terms of the speed and magnitude of the job losses.\u201d What\u2019s more, fears are growing that after rebounding strongly in May and June, the economy has run out of steam, with many states reversing the reopening of businesses. \u201cEveryone wants to keep putting on rose-colored glasses, but it\u2019s blinding us to the reality of the situation and what we have to deal with,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. At the same time, the $600 supplemental weekly unemployment payment from the federal government is ending, a potentially crippling financial blow to millions. Republicans have proposed replacing the supplement with a $200 weekly payment, while Democrats want to extend it in full. \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere close to a deal,\u201d Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said Wednesday. \u2014\n\nConsumer spending plummeted in the second quarter, but not across the board. Copied to clipboard. Consumer spending is the bedrock of the U.S. economy, but shopping hotbeds like 34th Street in Manhattan have suffered during the pandemic. Credit... Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Consumer spending, the bedrock of the U.S. economy, plunged 10.1 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. It was by far the biggest drop on record. But the decline wasn\u2019t across the board \u2014 and the details help paint a picture of life in a pandemic. Spending on services fell 13.3 percent, led by a near-total collapse in spending on restaurant meals and recreation, the department\u2019s report on quarterly economic output noted. Health care spending fell sharply, too, as patients canceled elective procedures and delayed routine care. Spending on goods was a different story. Overall goods expenditures fell a modest 3 percent, and some quarantine-friendly categories actually had increases. Spending on recreational vehicles and related goods rose nearly 9 percent as consumers sought ways to travel without getting on airplanes. Other parts of the economy showed large contractions. Business investment, residential construction and trade \u2014 both imports and exports \u2014 all fell by double-digit percentages. One exception: Spending by the federal government rose 4.1 percent as Congress moved to prevent deeper economic damage. (That figure reflects only a small fraction of the government stimulus efforts, much of which are considered \u201ctransfer payments\u201d that aren\u2019t counted in gross domestic product.) \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStocks drop as economic numbers highlight the pandemic\u2019s toll.

Credit... Max Whittaker for The New York Times Stocks slid on Thursday as economic reports from the United States and Germany showed the toll of the coronavirus outbreak on growth, but a rally in shares of big technology companies, ahead of their earnings reports, helped minimize the blow to Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell about half a percent, while shares in Europe were down by more than 2 percent. The Nasdaq composite climbed as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all rose. The largest technology companies often set the direction of the broad market because of their sheer size. Oil prices were also lower, as were shares of energy companies. ConocoPhillips slid after the company said its earnings plunged by more than analysts had expected. Financial stocks, closely tied to the cyclical ups and downs of the American economy, slumped too, as long-term interest rates \u2014 set by the yields on government bonds \u2014 continued to plumb some of the lowest levels in history. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 0.55 percent on Thursday morning. Such yields help set the price of the loans banks make and significantly influence their profitability. The U.S. economy shrank by 9.5 percent in the second quarter, while Germany\u2019s economy shrank by 10.1 percent. On an annualized basis, the standard way of reporting quarterly economic data, U.S. gross domestic product fell at a rate of 32.9 percent, which is the sharpest drop on record. Data released at the same time showed that 1.43 million Americans filed new state unemployment claims, the second week in which that number has risen and a figure that highlights the persistence of the economic downturn. The grim data came a day after Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, told reporters that the \u201cpace of recovery looks like it has slowed,\u201d pointing to debit and credit card spending and hiring trends. He added, \u201cThe path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Granville and\n\nComcast saw 10 million sign-ups for its streaming service Peacock. Copied to clipboard. Comcast hopes to have 35 million users for its Peacock streaming service by 2024. Credit... Carlo Allegri/Reuters Comcast, the largest cable operator in the U.S., reported on Thursday $23.7 billion in revenue and $7.9 billion in adjusted profit for the second quarter, beating expectations. Here are the highlights: Peacock, its new streaming product, attracted 10 million sign-ups in its first three months. It differs from other platforms like HBO Max (which netted 4.1 million in one month) and Netflix in that it is free and relies on advertising for revenue. (There is a paid tier that features more content but still includes ads.) The strategy is reminiscent of the original broadcast system, which is also free. Comcast hopes to have 35 million users by 2024. With most of the country under lockdown, Comcast added 323,000 more broadband customers, but it lost 477,000 pay TV subscribers. People switched to cheaper streaming alternatives as wallets tightened under the pandemic. It\u2019s not a bad trade for Comcast, since a broadband subscriber tends to add more profit than a video one. At NBCUniversal, the lack of sports and the shutdown of movie theaters and theme parks hurt the division. Sales fell 25 percent to $6.1 billion. Theme parks took a $399 million loss for the quarter, and the Universal Studios division saw sales decline nearly a fifth to $1.2 billion. But a significant deal was struck this week between Universal and AMC Entertainment, the nation\u2019s largest theater chain, that could recast the economics of the film industry. The studio can now sell movies on streaming 17 days after it runs in theaters, collapsing the usual 90-day window. Movies tend to make most of its box office dollars in the first two weekends, so the new terms appear to benefit the studio. In other words, there will be more reasons to stay home. \u2014", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus", "author": ["Mike Isaac", "Karen Weise", "Daisuke Wakabayashi", "Neal E.

Since the 1980s, enforcement officials have used the notion of consumer welfare as the predominant test for antitrust violations \u2014 generally meaning that if prices are not going up, the markets are most likely competitive enough.

Holding a flimsy piece of paper with a Swiss watermark and Chinese characters, he crossed the bridge from the British colony of Hong Kong into Mao\u2019s China, one of the first foreign correspondents to report on a country largely unknown to the rest of the world in 1954. The paper was his golden ticket.\n\nSome six decades later, I found myself staring out at the same footbridge from the other side.\n\nIn mainland China on my own coveted journalism visa, I peeked out through the metal bars separating me from Hong Kong, now a semiautonomous territory of China. The closest my father had previously come to China was approaching this bridge to meet missionaries who, he wrote, stumbled \u201cout of the Chinese Revolution with tragic tales fully confirmed by their emaciated bodies and haggard eyes.\u201d\n\nAs the bamboo gate swung closed behind him, my father put one foot down on Chinese soil and looked up to see a simple mud village at the precipice of a new era. Decades later, I looked back to see a different view altogether: a towering skyline of glass and metal with one of the world\u2019s tallest buildings in a city going through its own dramatic transformation.\n\nIt was almost impossible to get to China from the West at the start of Mao\u2019s rule. The country had declared itself the People\u2019s Republic of China five years earlier, and it was the early days of the Cold War that divided Communist countries from Western democracies.\n\nMy father at a newsstand in Hong Kong, where he was stationed for much of the 1950s. Richard Harrington, via Stephen Bulger Gallery\n\nMy father had carved out an unusual beat, reporting for The Toronto Star and The Star Weekly from one newly Communist country to another, chronicling the path of each. On his travels he searched for a Chinese diplomatic office where he could get a visa to visit.\n\nIf he could find a friendly Chinese official in Moscow or another capital in Eastern Europe, he might have a chance to talk that person into giving him a visa. Yet in his early travels behind the Iron Curtain, China remained elusive. He persisted, propelled by an urgency to understand this huge nation.\n\nEventually, during a trip to Poland, his determination paid off.\n\nIn July 1954, he traveled to Bern, Switzerland, where he was told to pick up his visa.\n\nMy father left behind written notes and newspaper clippings, stacks of passports with visas, photos and transcripts from his first and subsequent trips to China. They have allowed me to imagine conversations that we might have had in the six years since he died. Conversations about how the country he saw back then \u2014 brimming with hope and enthusiasm yet also tightly controlled \u2014 is in some ways the same today.\n\nOne of my father\u2019s canceled passports, with immigration stamps for his trips to Poland and Switzerland.\n\nHis first trip to China spanned two months and thousands of miles. He met Mao Zedong (whom he tapped on the shoulder from behind his camera, mistaking the chairman for a \u201chumble courtier\u201d blocking his shot) and Zhou Enlai, the premier and foreign minister at the time. But he also talked with factory workers, actors, newspaper editors and shop owners.\n\nHe described being filled with hope for the human spirit he witnessed. But he also felt despair because a government-provided handler was never too far away, ready to silence anyone who veered too far from the Communist Party line.\n\nChina defied any broad-brush statement. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d he wrote in one notebook, \u201cunder the current leadership, the way in which the government silences alternative points of view makes it hard not to.\u201d\n\nA picture of Shenzhen's skyline taken from one of its many high rises.

Some of the datelines in his dispatches were different from today \u2014 Canton, Hankow, Mukden, Peiping \u2014 yet much of his observations still ring true.\n\nIn Beijing, he found more than just a city but also a way of life that defied the strictures of Communism. \u201cNo rubber stamp yet dictates the passions and peculiarities of its people,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cYou are filled with indignation in one moment and moved to admiration in the next.\u201d Excerpt from a 1950s notebook A selection from one of my father\u2019s reporting notebooks, as well as a photo he took of a man in Beijing.\n\nIt is the same today.

Smokers stub out their cigarettes on the No Smoking signs plastered everywhere.\n\nIn one of his notebooks, my father noted a seriousness to the people he met and interviewed. But, he added, it was hard to resist a smile, \u201cand everyone seems to smile; surely not all by government order?\u201d\n\nThe people my father met shared their aspirations, both personal and professional.\n\nA selection of images from my father\u2019s reporting trips, including one of a Chinese peasant in the Tibetan foothills and another of families of Chinese fisherman who, my father wrote, \"crowd into Hong Kong to escape harsh attempts to make them join People\u2019s Communes.\u201d \u00b7 William Stevenson\n\nOne young factory worker told him she had no time to think about getting married.

Two People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers were launched into action, he wrote, \u201cbefore you could say \u2018Chiang Kai-shek,\u2019\u201d referring to the Chinese Nationalist leader, who had fled to Taiwan after his defeat by the Communists in 1949.\n\nHe waved cheerily, and they retreated. It was over, he thought, until his guide told him that he had taken unauthorized photographs and that the military was waiting for him in Beijing where he would be forced to give up his camera. But the developed film was eventually returned, \u201cwith thanks by a grinning official who agreed the only military secret it recorded was this breathtaking and ageless barrier \u2014 the Great Wall of China.\u201d\n\nA group of men my father captured crossing a passageway. William Stevenson\n\nToday officials frequently demand journalists delete photos from their smartphones.

As we were preparing to leave, we were suddenly circled by more than a dozen police officers and government officials.\n\nThe female police officer as she approached me and my colleague. Alexandra Stevenson/The New York Times They scanned our IDs. They questioned our motives. They threatened our driver. They pleaded with us to write a positive story. They asked to see our phones, to delete our photos. We got a Beijing official on speakerphone to tell the police we were allowed to be there, to no avail.\n\nThe charade went on for two hours before another female cop inexplicably walked up to us, shook my colleague\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome here, thanks for your cooperation.\u201d\n\nThese interactions are not new. I experienced similar acts of intimidation when I was working in China a decade ago. But there is an undercurrent now that feels different, one that I recognize in some of my father\u2019s writing.\n\nHe struggled to reconcile what he saw with what he believed to be true. The \u201csinister regime where jails and punishment cells awaited the unfaithful\u201d was mostly invisible on his first trip. Yet, he later wondered, what had happened to those acquaintances who disappeared and then later reappeared with confessions in hand?\n\n\u201cYou start such a ride with mixed feelings. You are apprehensive, or maybe elated. You feel intrepid or inadequate to the challenges ahead. But whatever you feel, you certainly suffer a sense of foolishness.\u201d A draft from one of my father\u2019s stories describing the start of his China trip A collection of my father\u2019s work, including a transcript for a Canadian television broadcast and an article for Look Magazine published on March 8, 1955.\n\nThe government\u2019s heavy handedness would inevitably emerge. In Shanghai, he visited a theater, elated because for the first time in weeks there appeared to be no political subtext to the visit. But when he sneaked backstage he bumped into a big blackboard.\n\nAn excerpt from an article about the actor that ran in The Boston Globe. On it was an essay written by one of the actors, he was told. \u201cIt is called: \u2018Who are my friends and who are my enemies?\u2019\u201d It turned out, in fact, to be a confession written by someone who had complained, \u201cthis government gives me a pain.\u201d\n\nAs my six-month assignment in China came to an end, the country was preparing to celebrate 70 years of Chinese Communist Party rule. Every corner of the country was whipped up into celebratory fervor. Huge billboards of a smiling Xi Jinping with proclamations about China lined the highways. When my husband and I traveled through the mountains on a rickety bus in the southwest, we started a new game to pass the time: Spot President Xi.\n\nThe day before the parade I found myself sharing a cab to the airport in Shenzhen with Walter Liu, a 37-year-old Beijing native who now lives in California. Mr. Liu and his high school had participated in the 50th anniversary parade in 1999 when he was 17. He and his classmates were given pink and yellow blocks of paper to hold in a formation on Tiananmen Square. From above the sign read \u201c50.\u201d\n\nIt was the culmination of two months of rehearsals, first at his high school and then later during midnight rehearsals on Tiananmen Square.\n\nWhat Mr. Liu remembered most vividly was the excitement of being able to see his girlfriend during those midnight sessions. \u201cIt is rare that you could see your girlfriend at night,\u201d he said, smiling as he recalled it. \u201cWe could just look at each other from the crowd and wink wink. We couldn\u2019t even talk.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the parade, his parents squinted, trying to find him on their television. \u201cI don\u2019t think they could see me because I was so tiny,\u201d said Mr. Liu, laughing. \u201cI was one color pixel on TV.\u201d\n\nMy ticket to the anniversary parade. On the day of the 70th anniversary parade I, too, was a pixel. I had managed to persuade the government to give me a highly prized ticket to watch the parade from the stands, just as my father had done at the end of his first China tour.\n\nIt was an unusually hot day and the air was heavy with smog. Everyone had an identifier. Blue uniformed sanitation workers. Green soldiers. Dark blue naval officers. Blue-and-white track-suited volunteers. A thousand government workers from one Beijing district with white shirts and a red bird logo. I felt out of place, even though I was given a bright red flag to wave.\n\nMy father had stood in the same place for the fifth anniversary parade. He noted similar columns of troops, guns and tanks, with soldiers marching in unison and such \u201cterrifying rhythm\u201d that it was as though they were \u201cpouring straight off the production line of some human factory.\u201d\n\nFrom the stands, my father focused his binoculars on Mao, who stood beneath 10 huge lanterns waving and laughing. His gold-colored helmet had tipped to one side and his hands were hidden behind a thick cloak.\n\nThe crowd from the bleachers, with Mr. Xi projected in the background. Alexandra Stevenson/The New York Times I did not need binoculars to find Xi Jinping. He was projected, standing stiff, on huge screens at every angle. Just as Mao had done long before him, he came rolling out onto Chang\u2019an Avenue in a special retro-styled black car to greet and inspect the troops.\n\nThe two-hour parade ended with towering portraits of the Communist Party\u2019s top leaders over the decades since 1949. As they rolled out on huge floats, loud cheers erupted from the bleachers. Mao\u2019s portrait came first. The biggest cheer was reserved for the last portrait, of Xi.\n\nThere is much discussion today among intellectuals in China about how the state looks much more like it did under Mao than at any other time since the country opened itself up to the world four decades ago.\n\nI wish I could ask my father about that.

And this is \u201cThe Argument.\u201d [MUSIC PLAYING] Today, our guest is writer and historian Anne Applebaum. We\u2019ll talk about how authoritarianism became so appealing to conservative thinkers in the 21st century. [MUSIC PLAYING] Anne Applebaum\u2019s latest book is \u201cTwilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism.\u201d It\u2019s part memoir, part history, the story of people she once called friends, anti-communist intellectuals and conservative defenders of liberal ideals who, during the Cold War, fought for things like an independent press and a free market. In recent years, these same friends have become foot soldiers in the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism in the West. I read the book and found it utterly fascinating, even though I disagreed with a big part of Applebaum\u2019s premise. As I wrote in a recent column, \u201cthere\u2019s no mystery in the right\u2019s surrender to authoritarianism because for many of the people Applebaum describes, it wasn\u2019t a surrender at all, it was a liberation.\u201d Anne, not surprisingly, disagrees, writing on Twitter, \u201cIt is just as incorrect to write, quote, \u2018conservatism always contained the seeds of authoritarianism,\u2019 as it is to write progressivism always contained the seeds of authoritarianism.\u201d It is an honor to get to debate it with her on the show today. Anne, welcome to \u201cThe Argument.\u201d\n\nanne applebaum\n\nThanks so much for talking to me.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBefore you explain why you think my argument about your book is wrong, maybe you could just give a sense of the case that the book is making or the story that the book is telling.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo first of all, to be clear, the book doesn\u2019t really make a case. This isn\u2019t a political science book.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nMmhmm.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have a thesis. It\u2019s not an op-ed column. It rather is a reflection on a series of events that I took part in or I was aware of or people that I knew over the last 20 and 30 years. My previous books were works of history in which I did lots of research, and then I tried to show a problem from lots of points of view. And this is really the opposite of that. It\u2019s a very narrow and subjective view, including some events that I have a role in or I\u2019m somehow implicated in or biased about. It\u2019s about four countries, mostly about the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, with a big chunk about Hungary and some reflections on Spain. And it looks at the evolution of the right in all of those countries or the thing that used to be called the conservative movement or the center right or the Tories or the Polish Right or the Republican Party, and it observes that some people who used to think they were on the same side 20 or 30 years ago now are not. I start with a party at my house that took place in 1999. It was not a fancy party. And no, it\u2019s not a book about parties or catering. That just was a metaphor that I used for this alliance.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNo, it\u2019s a cinematic intro.\n\nanne applebaum\n\n[LAUGHING] And I try to explain that some of the people who were at that party are now people who I no longer speak to and many of the other people at the party no longer speak to. And the reasons are not personal, they\u2019re political. We\u2019re now all on opposite sides of this very profound political divide in Poland, which is a very profoundly polarized country, some ways weirdly like the United States in which people live in alternate informational universes and don\u2019t speak to each other and have a completely different view of the world. And so the book was a kind of reflection about how those deep divides happen, what causes polarization. There are a few historical references. I talk about the Dreyfus trial in France, which was a similarly polarizing moment in French history. I talk about division over Brexit, which was different in many ways from the Polish division, but also caused everybody to get mad at each other. And I tried to show what were some of the deeper reasons for these changes. Again, the book has no thesis. It doesn\u2019t argue that there is one explanation, and it looks rather for historical echoes across countries rather than tying everything together in a neat knot. I spent a lot of time, like you both do, writing op-ed columns that have to end with a single paragraph saying, x is y, [BRUNI LAUGHS] and therefore we should do z. And it was really a relief in this book to write something in which, no, sorry, I\u2019m not going to tie up all the loose ends for you. You\u2019re just going to have to figure it out yourself.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nIt was really striking to me, your use of Fritz Stern\u2019s \u201cThe Politics of Cultural Despair\u201d to sort of diagnose some of what you were seeing on the contemporary right. Stern was a history professor and a refugee from Nazi Germany who wrote about conservative intellectuals. So I also used \u201cThe Politics of Cultural Despair\u201d to try to diagnose the contemporary right, but I did it in a book that came out in 2006. So I\u2019m just going to put this quote out there that I used to try to explain what was going on in George W. Bush\u2019s re-election campaign in 2004. \u201cThe ideologists of the conservative revolution superimposed division of national redemption upon the dissatisfaction with liberal culture and with the loss of authoritative faith. They posed as the true champions of nationalism and berated the socialists for their internationalism and the liberals for their pacifism and their indifference to national greatness.\u201d And so I guess this is maybe the heart of our disagreement, right? I mean, I think I agree with you obviously about the horrors of Trumpism, but I do see it as more of a sort of evolutionary maybe inevitability of trends that were certainly present in the American right through most of my adult life as opposed to this real break with what had previously been known as conservatism. One of the things I saw specifically when I was covering George W. Bush\u2019s re-election in 2004 was a lot of talk about the, quote unquote, \u201chomosexual agenda\u201d as a kind of totalizing ideology. So when I read what you\u2019ve written about, the use of anti-gay prejudice almost as a kind of conspiracy theory in Polish politics, that seemed really familiar to me.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo I\u2019m not really disagreeing with you about that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s incorrect to say that some of the seeds of what we\u2019re seeing now were present 15 or 20 years ago. I think my disagreement is that I believe that the anti-communist movement, which is, remember, the book begins at a slightly different moment, not in 2007, but in 1999, and it\u2019s reflecting on an earlier period, which is the late 1980s and early 1990s. I\u2019m arguing that the anti-communist movement in that period had different components, and people were anti-communist for different reasons. Some of them were anti-communist because they believed in Realpolitik and they were worried about Soviet nuclear weapons, OK? And some people were anti-communist because they cared about democracy and human rights and the rule of law. And there were some people who were anti-communist because they were Christians and the Soviet Union was Marxist and atheist, and therefore they were against it for that reason. And one of the things that I trace in the book is this idea that that coalition over time break up. I think I even say at one point that it was probably artificially held together by 9/11, which kind of kept some people on the same team for longer than they might have been anyway. I mean, you could even argue that it was breaking up by the end of the \u201890s in the United States. And the same is true in Poland, where the anti-communist movement in Poland had people in it whom you would describe as left-wing. There were a lot of anti-communist children of communists and so on. As these different bits of it broke up, some people went in one direction and some people went in another. So I\u2019m not actually disagreeing about that. I mean, I think what I\u2019m disagreeing about is your implication that this was somehow inevitable, that, of course, the right would end up like that because the right was always authoritarian, and that\u2019s what it was about. That I disagree with. If you\u2019d been looking at the left in the 1980s, you might have been able to make that same argument. I was actually looking for a copy of my own book, which I can\u2019t seem to find, which is my history of the Gulag that was published in 2004.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nAnd in the introduction to that book, I talk a little bit about the communist tolerant part of the Western left, which chose to ignore and dismiss and downplay the existence of Soviet concentration camps because it was politically inconvenient. There was a piece of the left that was always also charmed by authoritarianism and tempted by extremism. Well, that\u2019s also in my new book a little bit too. But if I\u2019d said at that time, well, of course, it was inevitable that the left will therefore from this moment develop into an authoritarian movement, I would have been wrong. I mean, it could have been that those elements took over the left, and actually in one or two countries they did.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nThe point is that these movements were, particularly in the United States where we\u2019re cursed with our two party system, these movements are coalitions, and I was simply dissecting what happened to the right-wing coalition or the center right coalition that I felt myself to be a part of and clearly no longer do. I simply don\u2019t think that Trumpism was some kind of inevitability, that it had to be that way because that was the way the party was going. That there are these elements of cultural despair of deep pessimism about American society of fear and anxiety caused by modernity and technological change and social change, that that is all present on the right right now, of course, it\u2019s absolutely true. I write about it all the time, and it\u2019s part of my book. What I don\u2019t agree with is that retrospectively colors all anti-communists as proto-authoritarians, which would be ridiculous.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOh, I don\u2019t think\u2014 no, I mean, I don\u2019t think it retrospectively colors all anti-communists as proto-authoritarians. I just think \u2014 and I think that this comes out in your book \u2014 that the segment of that coalition that was genuinely concerned about human rights and democracy is smaller than, I think, people would have admitted at the time.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI mean, depends on which country, and it depends which time we\u2019re talking about. A lot of this is also to do with who won power and how and when. The anti-liberal or anti-democratic part of the Polish right, for example, was a fringe minority for 25 years, which had very little influence on Polish politics and was not even really visible. And even the Law and Justice party, which is now the ruling party, it was very briefly in power once before for a year and a half, and it exhibited a much more limited and narrow and less ambitious version of what it\u2019s doing now. It was still then a coalition that contained a wide range of people. Even the Law and Justice president, who was the one who died in the tragic plane crash, was somebody who cared a lot about the rule of law, for example, and polish judges and so on, and it\u2019s hard to imagine him presiding over this destruction of the judicial system that\u2019s taking place now. So that\u2019s around 2005. Even then, they were the truly anti-democratic anti-pluralist piece of the party was a fringe piece of the extreme. And that it has now moved to the center is the drama of the current story.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, I kept on wondering as I was reading you, when you look at the group of you on the right, conservatives, however you want to call yourselves, when you look at your kind of wide group of friends and acquaintances, not just in Poland, but also in Britain and the United States, and I assume you had some in Hungary as well, and you kind of observe who drifted readily, or at least eventually, toward the lure of authoritarianism or some of these more nativist administrations or governments, and who, like you, resisted or like the Never Trumpers here, what are the kind of character or logical or socioeconomic differences, what distinguishes the people who decided to go along versus the people who said, no way?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo first of all, to be clear, there are no sociological differences. I mean, we are talking about elite people. We\u2019re talking about educated sophisticated people who were not damaged by Poland\u2019s post-communist resurgence. Quite the contrary. I hesitate to generalize because one of the things I liked about this book is that, unlike as in writing columns, I didn\u2019t really have to generalize. I could just focus on a few people. But very often in Poland, a lot of the people that I\u2019m talking about are people who, for one reason or another, became dissatisfied. I mean, so for example, in Poland with the post-communist state. And sometimes they were dissatisfied for political reasons, and often they were dissatisfied for personal reasons. So they personally had not prospered to the degree to which they felt they should have done.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nAnd so there is a quality of resentment, a feeling that the wrong people have risen to power, the wrong people are achieving prominence. Our business class is not the right kind of people. So there\u2019s a feeling that the wrong people have somehow won or are somehow in charge. And you can look back through history, and the sort of classic profile of the revolutionary is somebody who\u2019s part of the elite, but not on top. So look at Lenin. Lenin came from the Russian aristocracy, but the lowest rung of the aristocracy, right? And then his family even dropped out of the aristocracy after his brother was sentenced as a revolutionary, and he has fantastic resentment, even though he\u2019s not from the working class. He\u2019s not the poorest part of the country, but he has this feeling of resentment against Russia\u2019s rulers. OK, the Russian revolution is a more complicated story than that. It wasn\u2019t all about Lenin\u2019s personal psychosis. I don\u2019t want to keep going with that analogy. I\u2019m just saying that if you do look back, you do find that a lot of radicals often fit that profile. And I think even in the U.S., Laura Ingraham, who I write about at some length, isn\u2019t somebody that I do know that well. She doesn\u2019t really count as a friend. She was just somebody I met a few times. And we have some mutual friends and so on, but I\u2019m not close to her. But she is somebody who I know was always very resentful of the fact that her achievements weren\u2019t more recognized. So she also has that quality of resenting the elite, which she is also somehow part of. I mean, to say that she\u2019s not an elite is ridiculous. I mean, she\u2019s \u2014\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nDid you ever read her book about what an elite is?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI read several of her books. I can\u2019t remember.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nShe wrote this book in 2003 where she basically defines elitism as a state of mind that sort of has nothing to do\u2014\n\nanne applebaum\n\nWith your actual\u2014\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\n\u2014with class.\n\nanne applebaum\n\n\u2014class. Yeah, right. Right.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo it\u2019s kind of this bizarre fantasmagorical version of elitism in which a person with the right politics can never, by definition, be part of the elite.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nRight. So she has defined herself as somebody \u2014 even though she\u2019s extremely wealthy, television presenter with millions of social media followers and a huge fan base, and a large house and all that, she nevertheless defines herself as being somehow anti-elite, which is, of course, ridiculous.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nIf you\u2019re asking what people like that have in common, this is often it. There\u2019s some element of resentment or a feeling of outsiderism.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut do you think she\u2019s changed? Because in your book, you sort of associate her with this optimistic post-Cold War milieu of Reaganism and people who felt like we won, and now we\u2019re going to go on to keep winning. Whereas when I look at her history, I mean, starting with Dartmouth where she is the editor of this school newspaper with Dinesh D\u2019Souza, where they become famous for trying to humiliate gay students by sending an undercover reporter to the gay student group\u2019s meeting and publishing excerpts of things that people talked about. Her book in 2003 is obviously extremely resentful and nationalist. I guess I don\u2019t see a Laura Ingraham that was at one point different or better than the one that we see today.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nNo, I\u2019m not sure that Laura Ingraham was ever different or better. Her views about the world have certainly changed. I mean, she has a much different view of American foreign policy. She has a different analysis of American history than she once had. I\u2019m not intimate with her. I don\u2019t know her well enough to tell you exactly all the components of it, although I tease it apart a little bit in the book. But that she was an anti-communist at a time when other people on the left weren\u2019t is true. And so I probably gave her more credit for that than she deserved in the \u201880s and \u201890s. But to me, that was a really important quality, and it remained an important quality for me for a long time.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, I want to say something very cynical and ask something very cynical, but these last years have made me pretty cynical, which is, you used the verb \u201cprospered\u201d before. You were just talking about Laura Ingraham\u2019s views have changed. I find myself wondering as we talk about resentment as a motivating factor, the size of the chip on someone\u2019s shoulder, to what extent do they actually have convictions that change in ideologies, or are they just grabbing onto the winning formula that puts them on the top of the team or in the winner\u2019s circle or make sure that they prosper? I mean, are they just kind of choosing horses rather than, in fact, evolving ideologically?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSome of them. I mean, some of them are deeply cynical. So one other person who I talk about in the book who won\u2019t be familiar to American listeners is a Hungarian woman called Maria Schmidt, whom I suspect of deep and profound cynicism. She\u2019s somebody who has a number of both business and political interests in Hungary, and she\u2019s made great efforts to stay on the right side of the current ruling party and is now one of their chief propagandists, even though I know that in earlier eras she was more doubtful about them. And I suspect her of being profoundly cynical. So one of the things that I tried to argue in the book is that, again, the human personality is very complex, and people can be motivated by more than one thing. And some people are motivated by an idealism or an ideology or politics, and some people are motivated by personal ambition. Some people are motivated by resentment. Some people are motivated by the pleasure in seeing their enemies squirm. And some people are, as you say, profoundly cynical, and sometimes those qualities dominate at different moments. I mean, I actually end the book with this discussion of cynicism and nihilism, and I say that this is the really dangerous sentiment for liberal democracy is that. Because once people become cynical and once they think it\u2019s all a game and it doesn\u2019t matter who wins, then you do begin to lose the virtue of the state, and then you really are open for all kinds of extreme politics. But yeah, I mean, are they cynical? Some of them really are, yes.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut there\u2019s also a relationship, right, between kind of doubt and fanaticism. If you\u2019re going to insist on something that on some level you know it not to be true, it\u2019s likely to make you more histrionic and more sort of uncompromising.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI think there\u2019s a quote in the book that I\u2019m not going to be able to recite to you off the top of my head, but it\u2019s a quote actually that comes from a guy who was a young communist in Poland in the 1940s, Jacek Trzynadel. And he described in a famous memoir that he wrote years later, he described what it felt like to be talking to a crowd of people. People are shouting and cheering, and he was lecturing the crowd whatever, support our Marxist state. I mean, I\u2019m just making up what he said. I don\u2019t remember the exact thing. And he writes, the more I was shouting, the more I was doubting what I was saying. Did I really believe what I was shouting? And I felt I had to shout louder not just to convince the crowd, but to convince myself.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nI think I was talking a little bit about something else, which is just rank opportunism. We were talking moments ago about Laura Ingraham. One of her Fox News colleagues Tucker Carlson, if you go back and you listen to Tucker Carlson 15, 20 years ago, he doesn\u2019t sound exactly or really all that much like he sounds now. And his voice has evolved in relationship to where he\u2019s gotten the largest audience, the most traction, the most power. And Donald Trump, I mean, does any one of us really believe that Donald Trump has an intrinsic and abiding ideology versus a set of hunches and instincts about which direction to turn in to maximize the adulation and the purchase on power?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut actually, Frank, I mean, I would say I actually think that racism is pretty deep in Donald Trump and is as close to a sincere belief as he\u2019s possible of holding.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo actually, Tucker Carlson, who I didn\u2019t write about, but is probably a better example, as you say, of somebody who has changed very profoundly. David Frum has a thesis about Carlson, which is that it was because what he really, really, really, really always wanted to do was be on television and be good at television. He tried various television projects, and they kept failing. And then finally, he hit on the formula that would win him millions of fans, and that was this kind of strange racist, nationalist, nativist language that is designed to appeal to mobs of like thinkers in America and that that was what finally brought him fame and glory, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s sticking with it. And so, yes, that would be an example of really sort of pure opportunism and a kind of nihilism. And that, as I say, is one of the enemies of good politics.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nBut where would you put Trump, Anne? Is Trump more Tucker or more Lenin? [GOLDBERG AND APPLEBAUM LAUGH]\n\nanne applebaum\n\nActually, a bit of \u2014 [LAUGHS] golly, that\u2019s not a question I ever thought I was going to have to answer.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nIt\u2019s not a question I ever thought I\u2019d ask. [BOTH LAUGH]\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo, I mean, actually, you can see elements of both. I mean, think about it. Trump is somebody who he\u2019s very rich. He\u2019s on the front page of tabloids. And yet, is he ever really accepted by the New York elite who he resents? Is he accepted by the real movers and shakers, the real bankers and businessmen in New York? Do they see him as a real player? I mean, no, they don\u2019t. I mean, for all I know, he may be deeply resentful of the people who look down on him because he was vulgar and so on. So he may well fit into that sort of, in that sense, the Leninist category, and at the same time be someone who, as Michelle said, is somebody who just has this instinct for kind of negative publicity. He understands how to move crowds and how to appeal to really base instincts. So he\u2019s somebody you can see both of those aspects in.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNow, one of the things that I think is really valuable about your book is its kind of international scope. So it\u2019s not just about what happened to the Republican Party. But to me, one of the questions that keeps \u2014 this may be a provincial question, but compared to maybe if Hungary is the worst case scenario out of all of the countries that you\u2019re writing about in this book, possibly followed by Poland, these are both countries where, as you write about, there\u2019s sort of a conspiracy at the very center of the government. Where do you see the United States on that trajectory? How far are we from Poland, or how far are we from Victor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo this may sound very bizarre, and I accept that it\u2019s my own weird provincialism, and it\u2019s my strange perspective as an American who lives at least part of the time in Poland. I think the United States and Poland are really similar in the sense that I do think that Trump came to power also on the back of a conspiracy that all of us \u2014 including me, but also many other people \u2014 underrated, which was the conspiracy of birtherism. And it\u2019s now sort of forgotten because so many things have happened, that this was the moment when he really broke into national politics was by being the kind of the loudest spokesman for birtherism. And what was birtherism? It was the argument that the president of the United States is illegitimate. He\u2019s not even American. And this argument had a tremendous amount of power and was believed by an enormous number of people. I saw a statistic once, it\u2019s between 20 percent and 30 percent of Americans believed this to be true. Now, think about what that means. If the president is illegitimate, that means that everybody \u2014 the media, the courts, the Congress, the civil service \u2014 everybody is lying to you. So the entire state is covering up this fact that the president is an illegal outsider and should not be president at all. If you believe that, OK, then you are ready for all kinds of radical changes and all kinds of radical politics because you have come to doubt all of the institutions of your democracy.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOh, that\u2019s really interesting. So that creates much more of a kind of \u2014 I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve thought before that there is such a through line between birtherism and then the deep state conspiracy.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nOh, absolutely. No, no, I mean, the use of conspiracy theories and conspiracy thinking by Trump is very similar to the way this was used in Poland and where it\u2019s been used in other places. And by the way, throughout history, OK? The Bolsheviks were great conspiracy theorists. And the way in which he used it and the way in which he has consistently sought to undermine public trust in a range of institutions \u2014 the deep state, the fake news media, the judges who are really Mexicans, they\u2019re not Americans \u2014 all that language used over and over. Some of it I think he does in a calculating way and some of it is instinctive. I mean, this is genuinely, I think, probably how he sees the world. All of this has built up and amplified the existing lack of trust in American society and helped to undermine people\u2019s faith in institutions. I mean, if you think American democracy is so rotten that we had a president for eight years who wasn\u2019t even American and it was all lied to us, then you\u2019re willing to see all kinds of things overthrown. Then what do you care about the State Department being decimated or the Inspector General of the C.I.A. being fired? Why should you care? All those people, it\u2019s so obvious that all of it is corrupt. And this is something that Trumpism has in common with the way politics are done not just in Poland, but in Brazil and in many other countries.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, I ask you this because you are a student, a scholar of authoritarians and authoritarianism, and because I suspect it\u2019s a question that\u2019s on a lot of our listeners\u2019 minds. Donald Trump, let\u2019s say he loses in early November. Do you think there\u2019s a real possibility that he rejects the results? And what does that look like? And if he wins, what do you suspect the next four years look like?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo those are two different questions. I mean, first of all, I think it\u2019s almost certain that he is going to question the results. He\u2019s said so already. He\u2019s been asked point blank, will you accept the result? And he\u2019s refused to say yes. So I think that is a clear possibility. It\u2019s something everybody should be prepared for. It may be that there is a very easy solution to that if it happens, and the solution is I think Biden himself has said, well, on January the 20th, he\u2019ll walk into the White House, and the Secret Service will escort Mr. Trump out because Trump will have trouble fighting the legality of it. But that doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t cause an enormous amount of trouble or do an enormous amount of damage by campaigning around the country between November and January and saying that the election was rigged and seek once again to use conspiracy theory to move people and prepare them for some other political project still to come. And so, yes, it\u2019s possible. But I should also say that I also think it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll try to cheat in other ways. I mean, I think the attempt to undermine absentee ballots, the hints that he might undermine the work of the post office so that it couldn\u2019t deliver absentee ballots, I mean, all of that is preparing both to try and cheat and to prevent people from voting, and also to begin to make the case that the election was rigged. So it is highly possible he\u2019ll do that. Second question \u2014 well, no, sorry, your second question was about what if he wins.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nIf he wins, is that it? Are we on a fast track, an express train to authoritarianism?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo if he wins, I mean, the main difference between Trump\u2019s first term and Trump\u2019s second term will be the kinds of people working for him. Because if you remember, in the early part of his presidency, there were still people working for him who believed they were there to do something good and they were there to protect the institutions of the United States. And although I\u2019ve criticized James Mattis, I do accept that he thought that what he was doing there was making sure that the army was OK and that elements of U.S. foreign policy, like our relationship with allies, were maintained. And a number of people who worked for Trump in the beginning had that commitment to the institutions and to democracy. In Trump\u2019s second term, there will be no such people. And so the government, the institutions will be run by people who are intent on destroying what they can and who will do so rather aggressively. And yes, I do think that would cause an enormous crisis in American democracy.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nThe other scenario is Biden wins, Trump leaves voluntarily or is escorted out. What then happens to the authoritarian fervor that he has cultivated during his four years when he\u2019s out of office?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo this is a really interesting question, and one that I have been talking to people about. Most think that \u2014 and these are mostly ex-Republicans, but people who know the party quite well \u2014 most people think that everything depends on how he loses. So if he loses by a lot, if it\u2019s a wipeout, if the Republican Party loses the Senate and if it loses even more seats in the House, then it is possible that a part of the party leadership will say we\u2019re right, that was a big disaster, and that was a really bad idea. And Trumpism was a road to nowhere, and it\u2019s a road to an ever-shrinking base. And therefore, there will be an election or an argument inside the party, and a new kind of leader will be chosen. And then as somebody said to me recently, and then there\u2019s at least a chance that we get rid of this authoritarian or we push to the fringes this authoritarian streak in the Republican Party. It doesn\u2019t mean that we will, but it means that then there\u2019s a chance. If the election is very close, on the other hand, if Trump loses very slightly, if the Republicans retain the Senate, and if the party still feels that this kind of rhetoric and this kind of language is a winning ticket, then the next presidential candidate may well be Tucker Carlson or Don Jr. [BRUNI LAUGHS] or Ivanka or someone who \u2014\n\nfrank bruni\n\nSo if it\u2019s Tom Cotton, we\u2019re lucky, right?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nIf it\u2019s Tom Cotton, you\u2019re lucky.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nThat\u2019s actually \u2014 [APPLEBAUM LAUGHS]\n\nanne applebaum\n\nOr Mike Pompeo. I mean \u2014\n\nfrank bruni\n\nUgh.\n\nanne applebaum\n\n\u2014 there\u2019s a range of people who will be competing for the role of the next and possibly more efficient and more intelligent Trumpist leader. And so then we are in a real national conundrum because then we have one political party which is not dedicated to playing by the rules of the game, and then the kind of polarization that we\u2019ve had will continue and get worse. And then we will find ourselves in the position of having every four years a kind of electoral moment of crisis.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo obviously, a lot of these trends that we\u2019re talking about in other countries predate the election of Donald Trump. But I\u2019m curious how you think the \u2014 I mean, collapse isn\u2019t the right word, but the kind of damage incurred to the ideal of liberal democracy in America has empowered authoritarianism in other countries and how the sort of fate of this election will then\u2014 the echoes that will have in other countries that have basically argued that liberal democracy has failed, that it was a joke, that its time is over.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo the election of Donald Trump, the re-election of Donald Trump, would have an enormous negative impact around the world, and it would absolutely empower other authoritarians, both sitting ones, whether in Russia or in China, for that matter, or in the Middle East, as well as aspiring ones in other countries that are current democracies. And this is both by the power of example. Trump and his language are quoted and imitated by people all over the world. I mean, for example, his use of the expression \u201cfake news\u201d to undermine the media is one that has been picked up and repeated by dozens of other authoritarian leaders or would-be authoritarian leaders. I mean, the other part of the story is that the authoritarian right, the new radical right around the world has deep links. There are deep financial links. There are deep links, kind of organic links on social media. These groups of people speak to one another. They share one another\u2019s memes. They communicate in different ways across borders. And the influence of the American alt-right on the European far right or the international alt-right is quite profound and vice versa. I think they influence one another. And there is no question that the re-election of Donald Trump would embolden and motivate those different groups who, as I say, are speaking to one another all the time anyway and help them propagate their ideas further.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, can I ask you a meta question, so to speak? In the very title of your book Twilight of Democracy and I think sort of the subtext of a lot of the discussion that we\u2019re all having here today is this notion that the trend line is away from democracy. The trend line is toward, very scarily, authoritarianism. I just want to kind of play devil\u2019s advocate maybe in a very hopeful vein. Poland just had an election. I believe\u2014 you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 was the closest election since the end of communism. And in fact, the authoritarian government barely won. You go back to 2016. Trump got almost 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton did in the popular vote. He won only after Russian interference, only after a late in the game assist from Jim Comey, and possibly also because so many people were so convinced the outcome was predetermined in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor that they didn\u2019t rouse themselves to vote. And since then, almost every metric, almost every measure, almost every election has suggested the limits of Trump\u2019s appeal. Is it possible that what we\u2019re seeing in Poland and what we\u2019re seeing in America is, at the end of the day, a blip, he asked hopefully.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI mean, maybe. I, too, hope that that\u2019s the correct interpretation. And our country and other countries have overcome even worse crises before. I mean, the Civil War was a pretty big blip on the history of American democracy. It was a moment of total collapse, and somehow we nevertheless recovered from that with some caveats. I think one of the reasons I wrote the book and one of the reasons I concluded it the way I did is that what I don\u2019t want is for Americans to become complacent, for us to say, well, our democracy is so great and so strong and our Constitution is so fantastic, and we\u2019re a superpower. I don\u2019t have to try that hard to make sure that everything goes well in our country, and it\u2019s all going to go back to how it was eventually. And anyway, Poland is far away, and they are central Europeans, and they have nothing to do with us. I mean, I really believe that it is that conviction of inevitability which was the big mistake, I should say, of my entourage or my milieu, my friends in the \u201890s. There was a kind of complacency that now that we\u2019re on this road to democracy, nothing can take us back. Because that is wrong. Countries do reverse themselves, and they do cease to be democracies. And we are going through a really extraordinary moment of technological and informational and demographic and social change, and changes make society very volatile and all kinds of outcomes are possible. And I don\u2019t want people to be complacent or certain that we will somehow go back to everything being the way it was before, and you don\u2019t have to really do anything about it or worry about it. because it\u2019s that feeling of inevitability that turned out to be wrong.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I think we will end it there. And even though we have some disagreements about the nature of pre-Trump conservatism, it was a pleasure to read \u201cThe Twilight of Democracy.\u201d It\u2019s a fascinating book, and I\u2019m thrilled that you came on the show. Thank you so much.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, thank you so much for your time and your thoughtfulness.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nOh, thanks for talking to me. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnd we\u2019re back. Michelle, what did you think?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I think that she\u2019s extraordinarily brilliant obviously. And it\u2019s often funny when you disagree with someone on Twitter in a column, and then you end up talking and you find out you agree more than you might have thought. And I should say that Anne Applebaum is someone who her willingness to kind of call out authoritarianism on the right certainly didn\u2019t begin with Trump. Something I probably should have brought up is that she was at one time a big fan of John McCain, who refused to vote for him, I think very honorably, in 2008 because he put Sarah Palin on the ticket, right? And Sarah Palin\u2019s rise to prominence was in a lot of ways a premonition of what we\u2019re living through now. And so one of the things that is so interesting about this moment is how you end up being in political coalitions with people that you never could have imagined, right? It\u2019s such a reminder of how long life is. That it would have been hard enough for me to imagine maybe being on the same side as Anne Applebaum in 2000 or 2003, never mind David Frum and Bill Kristol. But one of the things I wrote in my piece is that I think a lot of people on the left are very, very suspicious of Never Trump conservatives, and I really admire them because they\u2019ve really sacrificed something to stand up to him. And they\u2019ve sacrificed more than I\u2019ve had to or more than people on the left have had to just in terms of the fissuring of personal relationships, professional networks, right? I mean, I think it\u2019s really not easy to turn your back on the social and political world that you\u2019ve lived your whole life in.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nWhat you just described or what you just talked about is actually where I get my hope during these dark times. And what I mean by that is, you\u2019re right, you and Anne Applebaum agree more than you disagree, and that becomes clear when you talk with each other, and you have made temporary whatever kind of partnership with people whom you didn\u2019t expect to. I think that if I\u2019m going to be an optimist, one thing that could come out of all of this \u2014 and our conversation with Anne reacquainted me with this optimism \u2014 is that we can focus on what unites us more than what divides us. Understanding what a threat Trump is, being so deeply offended by some of the divisions he\u2019s exploited and the ways he\u2019s governed has reminded so many people from various points of the political spectrum of what they have in common and of how overlapping their fundamental values are in so many ways. Don\u2019t you think?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI guess, but I really wonder if that\u2019s more of an elite phenomenon, right? That sort of people who make their living by kind of arguing and writing in the search for truth and good faith argumentation are sort of necessarily in this moment on the same side. Instead of kind of politics\u2014 I\u2019ve written this before. Instead of politics being a war of ideas, the people who takes ideas seriously are aside in politics. I think if you look at the country as a whole, I don\u2019t see how you look out at America right now and say that this is a country where people are more aware of what unites them than divides them. I mean, to me, it looks like a country that\u2019s coming apart at the seams.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nI mean, it looks and feels that way. And yet, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just an elite phenomenon. I mean, if I flash back over the last couple of years, once Trump had been in office for a while and the offenses had mounted and mounted and mounted, the number of times somebody in a store, in a fast food restaurant, wherever, has kind of set an aside, an aside of disgust that lets me know that they\u2019ve developed the same reservations or deep concerns that someone writing op-ed pieces and simply using a different vocabulary is expressing. I mean, that happens all the time. And I look more recently \u2014 and I think this has been so fascinating and hopeful \u2014 I look at the polls regarding how Americans feel about Black Lives Matter and where that puts them in opposition to Trump, and I see an overwhelming majority of Americans coming together with the same idea of justice and rejecting Donald Trump. And \u2014\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNo, I think you\u2019re right that Donald Trump has created \u2014 and I think Jemele wrote about this, right, that Donald Trump has created, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a silent majority, but he\u2019s definitely created a fairly solid anti-Trump majority.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAgain, when I want to wear my optimist hat, I think Donald Trump in the long run, if things turn out better and not worse, I think Donald Trump has shown us who we don\u2019t want to be. At the end of the conversation with Anne, we talked in what I found to be a very fascinating manner about various scenarios. Trump barely loses. Trump loses big. Trump wins. Beyond all of those, there\u2019s a scenario where he loses, we move on. And again, this is my hope. This is me at my most hopeful and optimistic. Call me Pollyanna. We remember what Donald Trump did to us. We remember what he showed us in terms of the kind of America we don\u2019t want to be. And maybe we\u2019re the better for it.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I think that\u2019s certainly a possibility, right? I mean, if you look at all the reforms that you saw after Richard Nixon, I mean, most of them stood up fairly well until Donald Trump dismantled them. But there was not just this huge wave after, this huge Democratic wave that followed Nixon\u2019s resignation, but a whole flurry of lawmaking to try to solidify accountability, solidify transparency, solidify democratic institutions. I think it\u2019s going to be really, really important that people keep pushing on that. When Barack Obama first became president, there were people who wanted some sort of accountability for the people who had both misled the country into war under George W. Bush and also the people responsible for the financial crisis. And I understand why Obama, facing all these interlocking crises, thought that it was the time to sort of look forward rather than backward. But I think that was a mistake in retrospect, and it would be a fatal mistake if, inshallah, Biden becomes president. I think it will be really important to have something\u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, if it\u2019s a commission in the Justice Department \u2014 to sort of expose both the kind of instances of corruption and lawlessness that we maybe half know about. And I\u2019m sure there are a lot that we don\u2019t know about, right? I\u2019m sure there are a lot of utterly corrupt phone calls with foreign leaders as bad as the one with the president of Ukraine that we just haven\u2019t heard about. And so I think it\u2019ll be really, really important to figure out the places where norms need to be replaced by laws.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nI suspect we will be excavating the muck of the Trump administration for decades to come. I just hope that excavation begins sooner rather than later. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] But we should probably wrap it up there, Michelle. It\u2019s just you and me this week, which means 50/50 chance that you\u2019re going to be the one doing the recommendation. And I just tossed a coin. Heads it\u2019s you. What\u2019s your recommendation this week?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I am going to recommend \u2014 it\u2019s not a new book. I\u2019m going to recommend an old book that I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot recently and that I recently re-read, Milan Kundera\u2019s \u201cThe Joke.\u201d So I don\u2019t know about you, but I have a lot of these books that I feel like have been really formative, and yet at the same time I can barely remember. But I decided to reread \u201cThe Joke\u201d recently because we\u2019ve been, or I\u2019ve been at any rate, embroiled in this discussion over cancel culture, which even though I don\u2019t like the phrase cancel culture, it seems somewhat inescapable, and sort of what it means to be publicly shamed, what it means for a ideological movement to enforce its boundaries. And when I see people kind of cast out, I often think of this book.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nWhat is the storyline of \u201cThe Joke\u201c?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOK, so the storyline of \u201cThe Joke\u201d is there is a young communist in Czechoslovakia in the \u201840s, a very ardent communist, but somebody with a sort of slightly ironic temperament, who has a crush on this girl who is kind of earnest to a fault. And he teases her by sending her this jokey postcard \u2014 hold on, I\u2019ll just get the actual line because I have it underlined here. [PAGES FLIPPING] So he teases her by sending her this jokey postcard that says, \u201cOptimism is the opium of the people. A healthy atmosphere stinks of stupidity. Long live Trotsky.\u201d And this postcard, this joke, ends up completely derailing his life. He\u2019s drummed out of the party, drummed out of the university. He\u2019s sent to go work in the mines. So in some ways, this is not at all comparable to what we talk about when we talk about cancellation, right? Because the sort of horror of it is that it has the power of the state behind it. And sometimes I think that people my age and older, those of us who grew up on Milan Kundera and books like it, there are certain rhetorical modes that signal to us authoritarianism. And we see them on Twitter and maybe overreact because what was so frightening about them was that they had the power of the state behind them. And yet at the same time, I think he sort of really captures the emotional experience, or what I imagine to be the emotional experience, of being sort of drummed out of a movement that you identify with. Because the significant thing about Ludvik is that he really is a communist, and so he really does identify with the people who are casting him out. He doesn\u2019t really want to be a dissident. I\u2019ll just quote this line: \u201cI came to realize that there was no power capable of changing the image of my person lodged somewhere in the supreme court of human destinies. But this image, even though it bore no resemblance to me, was much more real than my actual self, that I was its shadow and not it mine.\u201d I think that line captures some of what happens when people become reduced to either the worst thing that they\u2019ve ever said or someone\u2019s impression of the worst thing that they ever said.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nIt\u2019s so interesting to hear you describe it, Michelle, because one of the more celebrated novels to come out in the last six months and one of the novels I most recently read is called \u201cA Burning.\u201d I\u2019m going to probably mispronounce the author\u2019s name, for which I apologize, but her name is Megha Majumdar, and it\u2019s set in India. And I\u2019m realizing how timeless, what stamina the story you\u2019re describing from \u201cThe Joke\u201d has. It is, again, about someone who, with a single communication, miscommunication, call it what you will, is branded forevermore and becomes a convenient object of analysis, demonization, caricature, whatever, for the society around her. So this is clearly a story that, regardless of epoch of decade, speaks to certain eternal verities of human nature.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI had heard of that book, but I hadn\u2019t realized that that was what it was about. But now I\u2019m gonna \u2014 we can make that a recommendation too because I\u2019m going to order it.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nBut this is your week. Your recommendation again is?\n\nmichelle goldberg", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/the-argument-authoritarianism-anne-applebaum.html", "author": []}, {"title": "The Economy Is in Record Decline, but Not for the Tech Giants", "text": "The pandemic has reinforced the advantages held by the big tech companies.

And we should have the elections on time.\u201d\n\nWhat about the procedures for voting in the November election?\n\nWhile the date of the presidential election is set by federal law, the procedures for voting are generally controlled at the state level.\n\nThat\u2019s why the nation has such a complicated patchwork of voting regulations, with some states allowing early and absentee voting; some permitting voting by mail or same-day voter registration; others requiring certain kinds of identification for voters; and many states doing few or none of those things.\n\nDemocrats included $3.6 billion in their latest coronavirus aid package to help states administer their elections safely during the pandemic.

Except this time, there were some cameras there. This time, the world saw what happened, bore witness to Black Americans who were asking for nothing more than to be treated like other Americans. Who were not asking for special treatment, just the equal treatment promised to them a century before, and almost another century before that.\n\nWhen John woke up, and checked himself out of the hospital, he would make sure the world saw a movement that was, in the words of Scripture, \u201chard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.\u201d They returned to Brown Chapel, a battered prophet, bandages around his head, and he said more marchers will come now.

And their words reached the White House \u2014 and Lyndon Johnson, son of the South, said \u201cWe shall overcome,\u201d and the Voting Rights Act was signed into law.\n\nThe life of John Lewis was, in so many ways, exceptional. It vindicated the faith in our founding, redeemed that faith; that most American of ideas; that idea that any of us ordinary people without rank or wealth or title or fame can somehow point out the imperfections of this nation, and come together, and challenge the status quo, and decide that it is in our power to remake this country that we love until it more closely aligns with our highest ideals. What a radical ideal. What a revolutionary notion. This idea that any of us, ordinary people, a young kid from Troy can stand up to the powers and principalities and say no this isn\u2019t right, this isn\u2019t true, this isn\u2019t just. We can do better. On the battlefield of justice, Americans like John, Americans like the Reverends Lowery and C.T. Vivian, two other patriots that we lost this year, liberated all of us that many Americans came to take for granted.\n\nAmerica was built by people like them. America was built by John Lewises. He as much as anyone in our history brought this country a little bit closer to our highest ideals. And someday, when we do finish that long journey toward freedom; when we do form a more perfect union \u2014 whether it\u2019s years from now, or decades, or even if it takes another two centuries \u2014 John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America.\n\nAnd yet, as exceptional as John was, here\u2019s the thing: John never believed that what he did was more than any citizen of this country can do. I mentioned in the statement the day John passed, the thing about John was just how gentle and humble he was. And despite this storied, remarkable career, he treated everyone with kindness and respect because it was innate to him \u2014 this idea that any of us can do what he did if we are willing to persevere.\n\nHe believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage, that in all of us there is a longing to do what\u2019s right, that in all of us there is a willingness to love all people, and to extend to them their God-given rights to dignity and respect. So many of us lose that sense. It\u2019s taught out of us. We start feeling as if, in fact, that we can\u2019t afford to extend kindness or decency to other people. That we\u2019re better off if we are above other people and looking down on them, and so often that\u2019s encouraged in our culture. But John always saw the best in us. And he never gave up, and never stopped speaking out because he saw the best in us. He believed in us even when we didn\u2019t believe in ourselves. As a Congressman, he didn\u2019t rest; he kept getting himself arrested. As an old man, he didn\u2019t sit out any fight; he sat in, all night long, on the floor of the United States Capitol. I know his staff was stressed.\n\nBut the testing of his faith produced perseverance. He knew that the march is not yet over, that the race is not yet won, that we have not yet reached that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character. He knew from his own life that progress is fragile; that we have to be vigilant against the darker currents of this country\u2019s history, of our own history, with their whirlpools of violence and hatred and despair that can always rise again.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/obama-eulogy-john-lewis-full-transcript.html", "author": ["The New York Times"]}, {"title": "A Quarter of Bangladesh Is Flooded.

The balance of power within families has shifted dramatically over the last 50 years, mainly because of money. The transformation began when the country\u2019s post-World War II economic boom hit the killer recession of the 1970s, and everyone began to realize that a whole lot of the families of the future would not be able to afford a middle-class lifestyle unless the wives kept working.\n\nThe women\u2019s movement combined with the hard facts of the economy created a world in which almost no one envisioned young women with a distinctly different wage-earning future from men. I\u2019ll never forget a visit I made to a community college in Connecticut, back around 1980. I was invited for some reason to speak to a class of young men, and I asked them to describe for me their ideal mate. There were a few polite murmurs about a good sense of humor and fine moral character \u2014 then someone called out, \u201cAnd a good earner!\u201d I cannot tell you how enthusiastic the room became over the \u201cgood earner\u201d qualification.\n\nIt took professional politicians quite a while to notice there was a change going on. Then in 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated then-President Jimmy Carter, it became clear the country had moved on to a whole new political wave. Analysis of the final tallies showed that both sexes favored Reagan, but the women split very narrowly while the men went Republican 55 percent to 36 percent. The gender gap was born, and it really turned into a canyon in 1996, when Bill Clinton won the women\u2019s vote by a wide margin, while men narrowly favored Bob Dole.\n\nThese days, women go to the polls more faithfully than men, and they are more likely to vote Democratic. That doesn\u2019t mean they always win. In 2000, women favored Al Gore for president over George W. Bush, 54-44 percent, while the men went for Bush, 54-43. In 2016, the male voters gave us Donald Trump in an election where the gender gap yawned at 11 points.\n\nBut the power is there. Black women, who\u2019ve fought dual battles against racism and sexism to exercise their right to vote, knocked the socks off Democratic organizers in Alabama in 2017 when they gave long-shot Senate candidate Doug Jones 98 percent of their vote and a victory over Republican former-judge-and-pursuer-of-teenage-girls Roy Moore.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/19th-amendment-women-suffrage.html", "author": ["Gail Collins"]}, {"title": "Opinion | The Last Days of the Tech Emperors?", "text": "On Wednesday, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, opened a half-virtual hearing on \u201cOnline Platforms and Market Power\u201d with a combative opening statement: \u201cOur founders would not bow before a king.

The fact that casinos are treated more generously than movie theaters, concerts, museums and churches handed Alliance Defending Freedom its opening. \u201cThe Free Exercise clause protects the exercise of religion,\u201d the church\u2019s Supreme Court appeal began, adding that \u201cno constitutional provision protects the right to gamble at casinos, eat at restaurants, or frolic at indoor amusement parks.\u201d\n\nThis statement of the case obviously appealed to Justice Alito, who began his 11-page dissent with this observation: \u201cThe Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion. It says nothing about the freedom to play craps or blackjack, to feed tokens into a slot machine, or to engage in any other game of chance.\u201d He added, \u201cBut the governor of Nevada apparently has different priorities.\u201d The state, he said, \u201cblatantly discriminates against houses of worship.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s assume that opening the casinos was a political and economic necessity for the state. But finding a constitutional violation requires more than clever rhetoric. It requires a very precise chain of analysis, a hard climb that Justice Alito failed to make. His burden was to show not simply that churches are limited to 50 people and casinos aren\u2019t, but that the state singled churches out for onerous treatment without reason. Federal District Judge Richard Boulware II, in rejecting the church\u2019s request for an injunction, offered the analysis that Justice Alito\u2019s opinion skipped over:\n\nOther secular entities and activities similar in nature to church services have been subject to similar or more restrictive limitations on their operations. The court notes that church services consist of activities, such as sermons and corporate worship, that are comparable in terms of large numbers of people gathering for an extended period of time to lectures, museums, movie theaters, specified trade/technical schools, nightclubs and concerts. All of these latter activities are also subject to the 50-person cap or remain banned altogether.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s casinos that Nevada singles out for special treatment, not religion.\n\nInvoking the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause, Justice Alito also claimed that the state was discriminating against churches on the basis of their \u201cviewpoint.\u201d \u201cReligion counts as a viewpoint,\u201d he wrote, a sentence I found baffling. Isn\u2019t belief in public health a viewpoint? In any event, he went on: \u201cCompare the directive\u2019s treatment of casino entertainment and church services. Both involve expression, but the directive favors the secular expression in casino shows over the religious expression in houses of worship.\u201d\n\nThe contorted effort to shoehorn this dispute into standard free-speech doctrine was only a prelude to a further charge: that Governor Sisolak \u201chas favored certain speakers over others.\u201d It seems that the governor supported and even took part in a protest after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, a protest that drew more than 50 people and yet was allowed to take place. \u201cRespecting some First Amendment rights is not a shield for violating others,\u201d Justice Alito wrote. In other words, the governor of Nevada is not only anti-religious but a hypocrite as well.\n\nWhy does any of this matter? After all, Justice Alito\u2019s opinion attracted only two other votes. (Justice Gorsuch filed a separate one-paragraph dissent, pithily observing that \u201cthere is no world in which the Constitution permits Nevada to favor Caesars Palace over Calvary Chapel.\u201d)\n\nI think it matters because rhetoric like Justice Alito\u2019s, by design or not, inevitably places the Supreme Court where it least belongs and where it is least qualified to be, at the center of a national debate over how best to protect the American public from a deadly pandemic. It\u2019s beyond dispute that public health has become politicized to a degree that would have been unimaginable just six months ago. Does the court really want to become a part of that politicization by opening its doors to a battle not its own? That even a minority of justices would seize this moment to advance their religious agenda, especially given that agenda\u2019s nearly unqualified success in recent years, is deeply unsettling.\n\n(I\u2019ve been fascinated that some liberal commentators found the dissenting opinions persuasive and the case a close one. I understand the impulse not to appear unduly antagonistic toward religion, but I think that generosity toward the religious claim here loses sight of the broader context in which the dissenting justices were writing.)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/supreme-court-religion-coronavirus.html", "author": ["Linda Greenhouse"]}, {"title": "The Mysterious Life of Birds Who Never Come Down", "text": "And they are doing more. As Dokter and his colleagues write, migratory birds orient themselves through a complex of interacting compass mechanisms. During vesper flights, swifts have access to them all. At this panoptic height, they can see the scattered patterns of the stars overhead, and at the same time they can calibrate their magnetic compasses, getting their bearings according to the light-polarization patterns that are strongest and clearest in twilit skies. Stars, wind, polarized light, magnetic cues, the distant stacks of clouds a hundred miles out, clear cold air, and below them the hush of a world tilting toward sleep or waking toward dawn. What they are doing is flying so high that they can work out exactly where they are, to know what they should do next. They\u2019re quietly, perfectly, orienting themselves.\n\nThe behavioral ecologist Cecilia Nilsson and her team have discovered that swifts don\u2019t make these flights alone. They ascend as flocks every evening before singly drifting down, while in the morning they fly up alone and return to earth together. To orient themselves correctly, to make the right decisions, they need to pay attention not only to the cues of the world around them but also to one another. Nilsson and her colleagues hypothesize that swifts on their vesper flights are working according to what is called the many-wrongs principle. That is, they\u2019re averaging all their individual assessments in order to reach the best navigational decision. If you\u2019re in a flock, decisions about what to do next are improved if you exchange information with those around you. We can speak to one another; what swifts do is pay attention to what other swifts are doing. And in the end it can be as simple as this: They follow one another.\n\nThe realm of my own life is the quotidian, the everyday, where I sleep and eat and work and think. Until now, I\u2019ve been privileged enough to experience it as a place of relative quiet. It\u2019s a space of rising and falling hopes and worries, costs and benefits, plans and distractions, and it can batter and distract me, just as high winds and rainfall send swifts off-course. Sometimes it\u2019s a hard place to be, but it\u2019s home to me.\n\nThinking about swifts has made me think more carefully about the ways in which I\u2019ve dealt with difficulty. When I was small, I comforted myself with thoughts of layers of rising air; later I hid myself among the whispers of recorded works of fiction, helping myself fall asleep by playing audiobooks on my phone. We all have our defenses. Some of them are self-defeating, but others are occasions for joy: the absorption of a hobby, the writing of a poem, speeding on a Harley, the slow assembly of a collection of records or shells. \u201cThe best thing for being sad,\u201d said T.H. White\u2019s Merlyn, \u201cis to learn something.\u201d As my friend Christina says, all of us have to live our lives most of the time inside the protective structures that we have built; none of us can bear too much reality. And with the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s terrifying grip on the globe, as so many of us cling desperately to the remnants of what we assumed would always be normality \u2014 sometimes in ways that put us, our loved ones and others in danger \u2014 my usual defenses against difficulty have begun to feel uncomfortably provisional and precarious.\n\nSwifts have, of late, become my fable of community, teaching us about how to make right decisions in the face of oncoming bad weather. They aren\u2019t always cresting the atmospheric boundary layer at dizzying heights; most of the time they are living below it in thick and complicated air. That\u2019s where they feed and mate and bathe and drink and are. But to find out about the important things that will affect their lives, they must go higher to survey the wider scene, and there communicate with others about the larger forces impinging on their realm.\n\nNot all of us need to make that climb, just as many swifts eschew their vesper flights because they are occupied with eggs and young \u2014 but surely some of us are required, by dint of flourishing life and the well-being of us all, to look clearly at the things that are so easily obscured by the everyday. To take time to see the things we need to set our courses toward or against; the things we need to think about to know what we should do next. To trust in careful observation and expertise, in its sharing for the common good. When I read the news and grieve, my mind has more than once turned to vesper flights, to the strength and purpose that can arise from the collaboration of numberless frail and multitudinous souls. If only we could have seen the clouds that sat like dark rubble on our own horizon for what they were; if only we could have worked together to communicate the urgency of what they would become.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/vesper-flights.html", "author": ["Helen Macdonald"]}]}, "newyorktimes_technology": {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology", "articles": [{"title": "A Collapse That Wiped Out 5 Years of Growth, With No Bounce in Sight", "text": "\u201cNot only have we plateaued, but we may be losing ground,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton in Chicago. \u201cTo have these kinds of numbers in July when many in Congress hoped this would be over by summer underscores how unique and persistent the Covid crisis is.\u201d\n\nThe economic collapse in the second quarter was unrivaled in its speed and breathtaking in its severity.

In April, Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, told investors to expect no operating profit, and maybe even a loss, as the company planned to spend about $4 billion on coronavirus-related expenses, including temporary pay increases, declines in warehouse efficiency because of social distancing and $300 million for testing its work force for the virus. \u201cIf you\u2019re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we\u2019re not thinking small,\u201d he said at the time. Amazon had been paying workers an extra $2 an hour, but that benefit expired in May. At the end of June, it announced one-time \u201cthank you\u201d bonus of $500 for full-time associates in its warehouses. But even those costs did not compare to the immense surge in demand, with online retail sales up 48 percent. As Americans have stayed home during the virus, they have flocked to online shopping. \u201cE-commerce is off the charts right now,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee whose company, CommerceIQ, helps major consumer brands manager their Amazon business. The initial shock of panic buying has subsided, but \u201cdemand is starting to stabilize, at a much higher level,\u201d he said. Mr. Olsavsky said customers returned to buying more profitable products, like clothing, versus lower-margin groceries and cleaning suppliers. One of the biggest challenges Amazon had expected was keeping up with demand, as the virus flared among its workers and the communities where they live. Mr. Olsavsky said the company was able to fulfill more orders than it had previously expected. The number of products it sold grew 57 percent, but the number of employees it had was up just 34 percent. On the call with reporters, Amazon declined to say if it would be paying its warehouse workers more in the current quarter. It said that pandemic-related expenses would fall to $2 billion in the quarter. Sales at Amazon\u2019s lucrative cloud computing business, whose customers range from major corporations to start-ups, grew 29 percent, to $10.8 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, though it was more profitable than they expected. \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlphabet\u2019s revenue drops, but beats Wall Street expectations.

Jason Henry for The New York Times Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday, hurt by a slowdown in spending by advertisers. Alphabet said its revenue fell 2 percent to $38.3 billion in the second quarter compared with a year ago. The decline came largely from lower sales of advertisements that run alongside its search results because of the coronavirus pandemic, although the company posted an increase in revenue from YouTube ads and its cloud-computing business. The results were the first time that quarterly revenue had declined in its 17 years as a publicly traded company, but Alphabet exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations for revenue and profit. Net profit totaled $6.96 billion, down 30 percent from a year ago. \u2014\n\nFord made $1.1 billion profit in the second quarter even as sales tumbled. Copied to clipboard.

Nolis Anderson for The New York Times Ford Motor said Thursday it earned $1.1 billion in the second quarter as a large one-time gain in the value of its investment in an autonomous driving company more than offset losses in its main business. Without the gain, from its stake in Argo AI, Ford lost $1.9 billion excluding interest and taxes. The result was better than Ford\u2019s earlier forecast of a pretax loss of $5 billion. The coronavirus pandemic forced Ford and other automakers to close factories for nearly two months starting in March. On Wednesday, General Motors said it lost $758 million in the second quarter. Ford said in a statement that it expected \u201cno further significant coronavirus-related disruptions to production\u201d in the second half of the year. But the company also said it was not expecting \u201cmeaningful change in the current economic conditions.\u201d Ford\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hackett, said in a conference call that reductions in spending and an efficient restart of production enabled the company to avoid the kind of dire results it forecast in April. In after-hours trading, Ford shares rose more than 2 percent to about $6.90. The automaker forecast that it would earn $500 million to $1.5 billion on a pretax basis in the third quarter, amid weaker demand for new vehicles, parts and services. Ford\u2019s deliveries of new vehicles fell by half to 645,000 in the second quarter largely because of the pandemic. Its auto operations lost money in every region in the world, including a $954 million setback in North America. The company used up $5.3 billion in cash in the quarter, but said it still has $39 billion on hand at the end of June. Ford recorded a gain of $3.5 billion from a transaction related to an alliance it formed with Volkswagen, which bought a stake in Argo AI. Ford has been trying for three years to streamline its operations and return to robust profits, but has come under criticism for slow progress. Mr. Hackett said Ford was pinning its hopes on new vehicles it unveiled in the last few weeks: a redesigned version of its F-150 pickup truck and a line of rugged sport-utility vehicles that will be marketed under the Bronco name. The company said it had already taken reservations for 150,000 Broncos. \u2014\n\nApple blows past expectations with surging sales and profits. Copied to clipboard. Consumers bought huge amounts of Apple products despite a global economic slowdown. Credit... Victor J. Blue for The New York Times From April through June, millions of people lost their jobs, thousands of businesses closed \u2014 and Apple made a further $11.25 billion in profits. A global economic slowdown in the second quarter did not faze one of the world\u2019s richest and most resilient companies, as people kept buying Apple devices en masse and paid the tech giant billions of dollars more for apps and services on those gadgets. Apple said its sales rose 11 percent to $59.7 billion and its profits increased 12 percent to $11.25 billion. Both figures handily beat analysts\u2019 expectations, with Wall Street having forecast declines in both areas. Revenue rose for all of Apple\u2019s product categories and in all of its geographic areas, unusual success even by Apple\u2019s lofty standards. Sales were particularly strong for iPads and Mac computers, as the public was increasingly forced to work and socialize virtually because of the pandemic. Revenue also surged in its internet-services business, which includes Apple\u2019s cut of sales from the App Store, the subject of antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe. Even the iPhone, which remains the company\u2019s biggest seller, notched a slight increase in sales for only the second time in the past seven quarters. Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview that the shift to working and learning from home had led more people to splurge on Apple\u2019s devices. \u201cOur products and services are very relevant to our customers\u2019 lives, and in some cases, even more during the pandemic than ever before,\u201d he said. But while the pandemic has further entrenched the biggest tech companies\u2019 power, Mr. Maestri disputed the idea that it had been good for business, saying the quarter would have been even stronger without it. \u201cWe believe we\u2019ve lost several billion dollars because of the pandemic,\u201d he said. Investors have flocked to Apple\u2019s shares as a safe haven from an economic recession, pushing its stock price up about 30 percent this year to a roughly $1.67 trillion value. \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n1.43 million filed new state unemployment claims last week.

Joseph Rushmore for The New York Times The number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment benefits totaled 1.43 million last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It was the 19th straight week that the tally exceeded one million, an unheard-of figure before the coronavirus pandemic. And it was the second weekly increase in a row after nearly four months of declines, a sign of how the rebound in cases has undercut the economy\u2019s nascent recovery. Claims for the previous week totaled 1.42 million. New claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the government\u2019s program aimed at covering freelancers, the self-employed and other workers not covered by traditional unemployment benefits, totaled 830,000, down from 975,000 the week before.

Noting that weekly claims were in the 200,000 range before the pandemic brought widespread shutdowns in March, she added, \u201cThis is unique in terms of the speed and magnitude of the job losses.\u201d What\u2019s more, fears are growing that after rebounding strongly in May and June, the economy has run out of steam, with many states reversing the reopening of businesses. \u201cEveryone wants to keep putting on rose-colored glasses, but it\u2019s blinding us to the reality of the situation and what we have to deal with,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. At the same time, the $600 supplemental weekly unemployment payment from the federal government is ending, a potentially crippling financial blow to millions. Republicans have proposed replacing the supplement with a $200 weekly payment, while Democrats want to extend it in full. \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere close to a deal,\u201d Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, said Wednesday. \u2014\n\nConsumer spending plummeted in the second quarter, but not across the board.

Hiroko Masuike/The New York Times Consumer spending, the bedrock of the U.S. economy, plunged 10.1 percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. It was by far the biggest drop on record. But the decline wasn\u2019t across the board \u2014 and the details help paint a picture of life in a pandemic. Spending on services fell 13.3 percent, led by a near-total collapse in spending on restaurant meals and recreation, the department\u2019s report on quarterly economic output noted. Health care spending fell sharply, too, as patients canceled elective procedures and delayed routine care. Spending on goods was a different story. Overall goods expenditures fell a modest 3 percent, and some quarantine-friendly categories actually had increases. Spending on recreational vehicles and related goods rose nearly 9 percent as consumers sought ways to travel without getting on airplanes. Other parts of the economy showed large contractions. Business investment, residential construction and trade \u2014 both imports and exports \u2014 all fell by double-digit percentages. One exception: Spending by the federal government rose 4.1 percent as Congress moved to prevent deeper economic damage. (That figure reflects only a small fraction of the government stimulus efforts, much of which are considered \u201ctransfer payments\u201d that aren\u2019t counted in gross domestic product.) \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStocks drop as economic numbers highlight the pandemic\u2019s toll.

Credit... Max Whittaker for The New York Times Stocks slid on Thursday as economic reports from the United States and Germany showed the toll of the coronavirus outbreak on growth, but a rally in shares of big technology companies, ahead of their earnings reports, helped minimize the blow to Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell about half a percent, while shares in Europe were down by more than 2 percent. The Nasdaq composite climbed as Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook all rose. The largest technology companies often set the direction of the broad market because of their sheer size. Oil prices were also lower, as were shares of energy companies. ConocoPhillips slid after the company said its earnings plunged by more than analysts had expected. Financial stocks, closely tied to the cyclical ups and downs of the American economy, slumped too, as long-term interest rates \u2014 set by the yields on government bonds \u2014 continued to plumb some of the lowest levels in history. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 0.55 percent on Thursday morning. Such yields help set the price of the loans banks make and significantly influence their profitability. The U.S. economy shrank by 9.5 percent in the second quarter, while Germany\u2019s economy shrank by 10.1 percent. On an annualized basis, the standard way of reporting quarterly economic data, U.S. gross domestic product fell at a rate of 32.9 percent, which is the sharpest drop on record. Data released at the same time showed that 1.43 million Americans filed new state unemployment claims, the second week in which that number has risen and a figure that highlights the persistence of the economic downturn. The grim data came a day after Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, told reporters that the \u201cpace of recovery looks like it has slowed,\u201d pointing to debit and credit card spending and hiring trends. He added, \u201cThe path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in keeping the virus in check.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Granville and\n\nComcast saw 10 million sign-ups for its streaming service Peacock. Copied to clipboard. Comcast hopes to have 35 million users for its Peacock streaming service by 2024. Credit... Carlo Allegri/Reuters Comcast, the largest cable operator in the U.S., reported on Thursday $23.7 billion in revenue and $7.9 billion in adjusted profit for the second quarter, beating expectations. Here are the highlights: Peacock, its new streaming product, attracted 10 million sign-ups in its first three months. It differs from other platforms like HBO Max (which netted 4.1 million in one month) and Netflix in that it is free and relies on advertising for revenue. (There is a paid tier that features more content but still includes ads.) The strategy is reminiscent of the original broadcast system, which is also free. Comcast hopes to have 35 million users by 2024. With most of the country under lockdown, Comcast added 323,000 more broadband customers, but it lost 477,000 pay TV subscribers. People switched to cheaper streaming alternatives as wallets tightened under the pandemic. It\u2019s not a bad trade for Comcast, since a broadband subscriber tends to add more profit than a video one. At NBCUniversal, the lack of sports and the shutdown of movie theaters and theme parks hurt the division. Sales fell 25 percent to $6.1 billion. Theme parks took a $399 million loss for the quarter, and the Universal Studios division saw sales decline nearly a fifth to $1.2 billion. But a significant deal was struck this week between Universal and AMC Entertainment, the nation\u2019s largest theater chain, that could recast the economics of the film industry. The studio can now sell movies on streaming 17 days after it runs in theaters, collapsing the usual 90-day window. Movies tend to make most of its box office dollars in the first two weekends, so the new terms appear to benefit the studio. In other words, there will be more reasons to stay home. \u2014", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/07/30/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus", "author": ["Mike Isaac", "Karen Weise", "Daisuke Wakabayashi", "Neal E.

Mr. Williams said he and his wife had checked it out when the store first opened in 2014.\n\nThe detective turned over the first piece of paper. It was a still image from a surveillance video, showing a heavyset man, dressed in black and wearing a red St. Louis Cardinals cap, standing in front of a watch display. Five timepieces, worth $3,800, were shoplifted.\n\n\u201cIs this you?\u201d asked the detective.\n\nThe second piece of paper was a close-up. The photo was blurry, but it was clearly not Mr. Williams. He picked up the image and held it next to his face.\n\n\u201cNo, this is not me,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cYou think all black men look alike?\u201d\n\nMr. Williams knew that he had not committed the crime in question.

But there are about 65,000 new cases each day in the United States, compared with fewer than 10,000 new cases across the Atlantic.\n\nThe next reason is politics. When European leaders reached an agreement last week on a 750 billion euro ($888 billion) recovery fund, it wasn\u2019t the size of the deal that impressed investors, but the fact that it happened after four long nights of negotiations. The decision to raise money collectively and give grants to the countries hit hardest by the pandemic was a message that there is some political will left to further the project that created the euro two decades ago. European unity could still be found in an emergency, despite fraying on the edges caused by the exit of Britain from the European Union, budget fights with Italy, and concerns about the dismantling of democracy in Hungary.\n\n\u201cThe E.U. recovery fund is a gigantic step forward for Europe,\u201d Mr. Thiel said. \u201cThe E.U. has always been an organization that has reacted in times of crises.

Holding a flimsy piece of paper with a Swiss watermark and Chinese characters, he crossed the bridge from the British colony of Hong Kong into Mao\u2019s China, one of the first foreign correspondents to report on a country largely unknown to the rest of the world in 1954. The paper was his golden ticket.\n\nSome six decades later, I found myself staring out at the same footbridge from the other side.\n\nIn mainland China on my own coveted journalism visa, I peeked out through the metal bars separating me from Hong Kong, now a semiautonomous territory of China. The closest my father had previously come to China was approaching this bridge to meet missionaries who, he wrote, stumbled \u201cout of the Chinese Revolution with tragic tales fully confirmed by their emaciated bodies and haggard eyes.\u201d\n\nAs the bamboo gate swung closed behind him, my father put one foot down on Chinese soil and looked up to see a simple mud village at the precipice of a new era. Decades later, I looked back to see a different view altogether: a towering skyline of glass and metal with one of the world\u2019s tallest buildings in a city going through its own dramatic transformation.\n\nIt was almost impossible to get to China from the West at the start of Mao\u2019s rule. The country had declared itself the People\u2019s Republic of China five years earlier, and it was the early days of the Cold War that divided Communist countries from Western democracies.\n\nMy father at a newsstand in Hong Kong, where he was stationed for much of the 1950s. Richard Harrington, via Stephen Bulger Gallery\n\nMy father had carved out an unusual beat, reporting for The Toronto Star and The Star Weekly from one newly Communist country to another, chronicling the path of each. On his travels he searched for a Chinese diplomatic office where he could get a visa to visit.\n\nIf he could find a friendly Chinese official in Moscow or another capital in Eastern Europe, he might have a chance to talk that person into giving him a visa. Yet in his early travels behind the Iron Curtain, China remained elusive. He persisted, propelled by an urgency to understand this huge nation.\n\nEventually, during a trip to Poland, his determination paid off.\n\nIn July 1954, he traveled to Bern, Switzerland, where he was told to pick up his visa.\n\nMy father left behind written notes and newspaper clippings, stacks of passports with visas, photos and transcripts from his first and subsequent trips to China. They have allowed me to imagine conversations that we might have had in the six years since he died. Conversations about how the country he saw back then \u2014 brimming with hope and enthusiasm yet also tightly controlled \u2014 is in some ways the same today.\n\nOne of my father\u2019s canceled passports, with immigration stamps for his trips to Poland and Switzerland.\n\nHis first trip to China spanned two months and thousands of miles. He met Mao Zedong (whom he tapped on the shoulder from behind his camera, mistaking the chairman for a \u201chumble courtier\u201d blocking his shot) and Zhou Enlai, the premier and foreign minister at the time. But he also talked with factory workers, actors, newspaper editors and shop owners.\n\nHe described being filled with hope for the human spirit he witnessed. But he also felt despair because a government-provided handler was never too far away, ready to silence anyone who veered too far from the Communist Party line.\n\nChina defied any broad-brush statement. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d he wrote in one notebook, \u201cunder the current leadership, the way in which the government silences alternative points of view makes it hard not to.\u201d\n\nA picture of Shenzhen's skyline taken from one of its many high rises. Alexandra Stevenson/The New York Times A version of this exists today. I have a long list of names of people who wouldn\u2019t talk to me because I work for The New York Times, portrayed in Chinese state media as the source of \u201csmears and lies.\u201d Sources I\u2019ve interviewed privately are later threatened by the local police, while stridently nationalist rhetoric dominates the state media.\n\nSeveral months after I returned to Hong Kong, the Chinese government in March expelled my American colleagues as part of a diplomatic dispute with the United States. In the past month, Beijing has tightened its grip over Hong Kong with a new national security law, threatening free speech and other civil liberties in the city.\n\nDuring his trip, my father traveled from Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chongqing in the south, to cities farther north like Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan and Beijing. Some of the datelines in his dispatches were different from today \u2014 Canton, Hankow, Mukden, Peiping \u2014 yet much of his observations still ring true.\n\nIn Beijing, he found more than just a city but also a way of life that defied the strictures of Communism. \u201cNo rubber stamp yet dictates the passions and peculiarities of its people,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cYou are filled with indignation in one moment and moved to admiration in the next.\u201d Excerpt from a 1950s notebook A selection from one of my father\u2019s reporting notebooks, as well as a photo he took of a man in Beijing.\n\nIt is the same today. In the summer heat, men roll up their shirts to expose their bellies, even though the government calls the act \u201cuncivilized\u201d and has tried to crack down. The unsuspecting bicycle rider is never too far from crashing into a manic delivery man zipping down narrow bike paths on the wrong side of the road. Smokers stub out their cigarettes on the No Smoking signs plastered everywhere.\n\nIn one of his notebooks, my father noted a seriousness to the people he met and interviewed. But, he added, it was hard to resist a smile, \u201cand everyone seems to smile; surely not all by government order?\u201d\n\nThe people my father met shared their aspirations, both personal and professional.\n\nA selection of images from my father\u2019s reporting trips, including one of a Chinese peasant in the Tibetan foothills and another of families of Chinese fisherman who, my father wrote, \"crowd into Hong Kong to escape harsh attempts to make them join People\u2019s Communes.\u201d \u00b7 William Stevenson\n\nOne young factory worker told him she had no time to think about getting married. Knitting, cooking and doing domestic chores were a waste of time, she said. And anyway, once she did get around to having a baby she would keep working.\n\n\u201cAfter 14 months a baby has to look out for itself,\u201d she told him. So she would leave the baby at the factory nursery, taking the child home only once the workweek was over.\n\nI have interviewed women who felt that the Communist Party today had failed them when it comes to the family, leaving them with no support.\n\nMao told them they were equal to men in work and life. Yet policymakers have intervened again and again to dictate how women should govern their bodies. First, they could have only one child. Now, they are being told they should have two children if they want to be patriotic.\n\nFor many women, motherhood is a losing proposition. They need to keep their jobs but risk getting demoted or fired when they get pregnant.\n\nLi Xiaoping in her apartment in the Shandong Province last year. Giulia Marchi for The New York Times \u201cShould a woman just go back to fulfilling her traditional role as a wife and be shut out of society after giving birth?\u201d Li Xiaoping asked me. The 33-year-old said she was fired for being pregnant. After she left, the electronics company she worked for sent her a bill equivalent to five years of salary for the hassle.\n\nDuring his first trip, my father was pushed around by unfriendly officials.\n\nWhile visiting the Great Wall, he left his guide to chase two men over the other side of the wall with his camera. Two People\u2019s Liberation Army soldiers were launched into action, he wrote, \u201cbefore you could say \u2018Chiang Kai-shek,\u2019\u201d referring to the Chinese Nationalist leader, who had fled to Taiwan after his defeat by the Communists in 1949.\n\nHe waved cheerily, and they retreated. It was over, he thought, until his guide told him that he had taken unauthorized photographs and that the military was waiting for him in Beijing where he would be forced to give up his camera. But the developed film was eventually returned, \u201cwith thanks by a grinning official who agreed the only military secret it recorded was this breathtaking and ageless barrier \u2014 the Great Wall of China.\u201d\n\nA group of men my father captured crossing a passageway. William Stevenson\n\nToday officials frequently demand journalists delete photos from their smartphones. Last summer, my colleague and I found ourselves in a small town in the heart of China\u2019s coal country looking for empty stadiums and half-built government vanity projects. As we were preparing to leave, we were suddenly circled by more than a dozen police officers and government officials.\n\nThe female police officer as she approached me and my colleague. Alexandra Stevenson/The New York Times They scanned our IDs. They questioned our motives. They threatened our driver. They pleaded with us to write a positive story. They asked to see our phones, to delete our photos. We got a Beijing official on speakerphone to tell the police we were allowed to be there, to no avail.\n\nThe charade went on for two hours before another female cop inexplicably walked up to us, shook my colleague\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome here, thanks for your cooperation.\u201d\n\nThese interactions are not new. I experienced similar acts of intimidation when I was working in China a decade ago. But there is an undercurrent now that feels different, one that I recognize in some of my father\u2019s writing.\n\nHe struggled to reconcile what he saw with what he believed to be true. The \u201csinister regime where jails and punishment cells awaited the unfaithful\u201d was mostly invisible on his first trip. Yet, he later wondered, what had happened to those acquaintances who disappeared and then later reappeared with confessions in hand?\n\n\u201cYou start such a ride with mixed feelings. You are apprehensive, or maybe elated. You feel intrepid or inadequate to the challenges ahead. But whatever you feel, you certainly suffer a sense of foolishness.\u201d A draft from one of my father\u2019s stories describing the start of his China trip A collection of my father\u2019s work, including a transcript for a Canadian television broadcast and an article for Look Magazine published on March 8, 1955.\n\nThe government\u2019s heavy handedness would inevitably emerge. In Shanghai, he visited a theater, elated because for the first time in weeks there appeared to be no political subtext to the visit. But when he sneaked backstage he bumped into a big blackboard.\n\nAn excerpt from an article about the actor that ran in The Boston Globe. On it was an essay written by one of the actors, he was told. \u201cIt is called: \u2018Who are my friends and who are my enemies?\u2019\u201d It turned out, in fact, to be a confession written by someone who had complained, \u201cthis government gives me a pain.\u201d\n\nAs my six-month assignment in China came to an end, the country was preparing to celebrate 70 years of Chinese Communist Party rule. Every corner of the country was whipped up into celebratory fervor. Huge billboards of a smiling Xi Jinping with proclamations about China lined the highways. When my husband and I traveled through the mountains on a rickety bus in the southwest, we started a new game to pass the time: Spot President Xi.\n\nThe day before the parade I found myself sharing a cab to the airport in Shenzhen with Walter Liu, a 37-year-old Beijing native who now lives in California. Mr. Liu and his high school had participated in the 50th anniversary parade in 1999 when he was 17. He and his classmates were given pink and yellow blocks of paper to hold in a formation on Tiananmen Square. From above the sign read \u201c50.\u201d\n\nIt was the culmination of two months of rehearsals, first at his high school and then later during midnight rehearsals on Tiananmen Square.\n\nWhat Mr. Liu remembered most vividly was the excitement of being able to see his girlfriend during those midnight sessions. \u201cIt is rare that you could see your girlfriend at night,\u201d he said, smiling as he recalled it. \u201cWe could just look at each other from the crowd and wink wink. We couldn\u2019t even talk.\u201d\n\nOn the day of the parade, his parents squinted, trying to find him on their television. \u201cI don\u2019t think they could see me because I was so tiny,\u201d said Mr. Liu, laughing. \u201cI was one color pixel on TV.\u201d\n\nMy ticket to the anniversary parade. On the day of the 70th anniversary parade I, too, was a pixel. I had managed to persuade the government to give me a highly prized ticket to watch the parade from the stands, just as my father had done at the end of his first China tour.\n\nIt was an unusually hot day and the air was heavy with smog. Everyone had an identifier. Blue uniformed sanitation workers. Green soldiers. Dark blue naval officers. Blue-and-white track-suited volunteers. A thousand government workers from one Beijing district with white shirts and a red bird logo. I felt out of place, even though I was given a bright red flag to wave.\n\nMy father had stood in the same place for the fifth anniversary parade. He noted similar columns of troops, guns and tanks, with soldiers marching in unison and such \u201cterrifying rhythm\u201d that it was as though they were \u201cpouring straight off the production line of some human factory.\u201d\n\nFrom the stands, my father focused his binoculars on Mao, who stood beneath 10 huge lanterns waving and laughing. His gold-colored helmet had tipped to one side and his hands were hidden behind a thick cloak.\n\nThe crowd from the bleachers, with Mr. Xi projected in the background. Alexandra Stevenson/The New York Times I did not need binoculars to find Xi Jinping. He was projected, standing stiff, on huge screens at every angle. Just as Mao had done long before him, he came rolling out onto Chang\u2019an Avenue in a special retro-styled black car to greet and inspect the troops.\n\nThe two-hour parade ended with towering portraits of the Communist Party\u2019s top leaders over the decades since 1949. As they rolled out on huge floats, loud cheers erupted from the bleachers. Mao\u2019s portrait came first. The biggest cheer was reserved for the last portrait, of Xi.\n\nThere is much discussion today among intellectuals in China about how the state looks much more like it did under Mao than at any other time since the country opened itself up to the world four decades ago.\n\nI wish I could ask my father about that. But I have a pretty good idea what he would say.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/30/world/asia/china-1950s-echoed-today.html", "author": ["Alexandra Stevenson"]}, {"title": "Ellen DeGeneres Apologizes to Staff Members as WarnerMedia Investigates Show", "text": "Ellen DeGeneres apologized to the staff members of her talk show in an email on Thursday, a week after Warner Bros.

And this is \u201cThe Argument.\u201d [MUSIC PLAYING] Today, our guest is writer and historian Anne Applebaum. We\u2019ll talk about how authoritarianism became so appealing to conservative thinkers in the 21st century. [MUSIC PLAYING] Anne Applebaum\u2019s latest book is \u201cTwilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism.\u201d It\u2019s part memoir, part history, the story of people she once called friends, anti-communist intellectuals and conservative defenders of liberal ideals who, during the Cold War, fought for things like an independent press and a free market. In recent years, these same friends have become foot soldiers in the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism in the West. I read the book and found it utterly fascinating, even though I disagreed with a big part of Applebaum\u2019s premise. As I wrote in a recent column, \u201cthere\u2019s no mystery in the right\u2019s surrender to authoritarianism because for many of the people Applebaum describes, it wasn\u2019t a surrender at all, it was a liberation.\u201d Anne, not surprisingly, disagrees, writing on Twitter, \u201cIt is just as incorrect to write, quote, \u2018conservatism always contained the seeds of authoritarianism,\u2019 as it is to write progressivism always contained the seeds of authoritarianism.\u201d It is an honor to get to debate it with her on the show today. Anne, welcome to \u201cThe Argument.\u201d\n\nanne applebaum\n\nThanks so much for talking to me.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBefore you explain why you think my argument about your book is wrong, maybe you could just give a sense of the case that the book is making or the story that the book is telling.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo first of all, to be clear, the book doesn\u2019t really make a case. This isn\u2019t a political science book.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nMmhmm.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have a thesis. It\u2019s not an op-ed column. It rather is a reflection on a series of events that I took part in or I was aware of or people that I knew over the last 20 and 30 years. My previous books were works of history in which I did lots of research, and then I tried to show a problem from lots of points of view. And this is really the opposite of that. It\u2019s a very narrow and subjective view, including some events that I have a role in or I\u2019m somehow implicated in or biased about. It\u2019s about four countries, mostly about the United States, the United Kingdom, and Poland, with a big chunk about Hungary and some reflections on Spain. And it looks at the evolution of the right in all of those countries or the thing that used to be called the conservative movement or the center right or the Tories or the Polish Right or the Republican Party, and it observes that some people who used to think they were on the same side 20 or 30 years ago now are not. I start with a party at my house that took place in 1999. It was not a fancy party. And no, it\u2019s not a book about parties or catering. That just was a metaphor that I used for this alliance.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNo, it\u2019s a cinematic intro.\n\nanne applebaum\n\n[LAUGHING] And I try to explain that some of the people who were at that party are now people who I no longer speak to and many of the other people at the party no longer speak to. And the reasons are not personal, they\u2019re political. We\u2019re now all on opposite sides of this very profound political divide in Poland, which is a very profoundly polarized country, some ways weirdly like the United States in which people live in alternate informational universes and don\u2019t speak to each other and have a completely different view of the world. And so the book was a kind of reflection about how those deep divides happen, what causes polarization. There are a few historical references. I talk about the Dreyfus trial in France, which was a similarly polarizing moment in French history. I talk about division over Brexit, which was different in many ways from the Polish division, but also caused everybody to get mad at each other. And I tried to show what were some of the deeper reasons for these changes. Again, the book has no thesis. It doesn\u2019t argue that there is one explanation, and it looks rather for historical echoes across countries rather than tying everything together in a neat knot. I spent a lot of time, like you both do, writing op-ed columns that have to end with a single paragraph saying, x is y, [BRUNI LAUGHS] and therefore we should do z. And it was really a relief in this book to write something in which, no, sorry, I\u2019m not going to tie up all the loose ends for you. You\u2019re just going to have to figure it out yourself.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nIt was really striking to me, your use of Fritz Stern\u2019s \u201cThe Politics of Cultural Despair\u201d to sort of diagnose some of what you were seeing on the contemporary right. Stern was a history professor and a refugee from Nazi Germany who wrote about conservative intellectuals. So I also used \u201cThe Politics of Cultural Despair\u201d to try to diagnose the contemporary right, but I did it in a book that came out in 2006. So I\u2019m just going to put this quote out there that I used to try to explain what was going on in George W. Bush\u2019s re-election campaign in 2004. \u201cThe ideologists of the conservative revolution superimposed division of national redemption upon the dissatisfaction with liberal culture and with the loss of authoritative faith. They posed as the true champions of nationalism and berated the socialists for their internationalism and the liberals for their pacifism and their indifference to national greatness.\u201d And so I guess this is maybe the heart of our disagreement, right? I mean, I think I agree with you obviously about the horrors of Trumpism, but I do see it as more of a sort of evolutionary maybe inevitability of trends that were certainly present in the American right through most of my adult life as opposed to this real break with what had previously been known as conservatism. One of the things I saw specifically when I was covering George W. Bush\u2019s re-election in 2004 was a lot of talk about the, quote unquote, \u201chomosexual agenda\u201d as a kind of totalizing ideology. So when I read what you\u2019ve written about, the use of anti-gay prejudice almost as a kind of conspiracy theory in Polish politics, that seemed really familiar to me.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo I\u2019m not really disagreeing with you about that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s incorrect to say that some of the seeds of what we\u2019re seeing now were present 15 or 20 years ago. I think my disagreement is that I believe that the anti-communist movement, which is, remember, the book begins at a slightly different moment, not in 2007, but in 1999, and it\u2019s reflecting on an earlier period, which is the late 1980s and early 1990s. I\u2019m arguing that the anti-communist movement in that period had different components, and people were anti-communist for different reasons. Some of them were anti-communist because they believed in Realpolitik and they were worried about Soviet nuclear weapons, OK? And some people were anti-communist because they cared about democracy and human rights and the rule of law. And there were some people who were anti-communist because they were Christians and the Soviet Union was Marxist and atheist, and therefore they were against it for that reason. And one of the things that I trace in the book is this idea that that coalition over time break up. I think I even say at one point that it was probably artificially held together by 9/11, which kind of kept some people on the same team for longer than they might have been anyway. I mean, you could even argue that it was breaking up by the end of the \u201890s in the United States. And the same is true in Poland, where the anti-communist movement in Poland had people in it whom you would describe as left-wing. There were a lot of anti-communist children of communists and so on. As these different bits of it broke up, some people went in one direction and some people went in another. So I\u2019m not actually disagreeing about that. I mean, I think what I\u2019m disagreeing about is your implication that this was somehow inevitable, that, of course, the right would end up like that because the right was always authoritarian, and that\u2019s what it was about. That I disagree with. If you\u2019d been looking at the left in the 1980s, you might have been able to make that same argument. I was actually looking for a copy of my own book, which I can\u2019t seem to find, which is my history of the Gulag that was published in 2004.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nAnd in the introduction to that book, I talk a little bit about the communist tolerant part of the Western left, which chose to ignore and dismiss and downplay the existence of Soviet concentration camps because it was politically inconvenient. There was a piece of the left that was always also charmed by authoritarianism and tempted by extremism. Well, that\u2019s also in my new book a little bit too. But if I\u2019d said at that time, well, of course, it was inevitable that the left will therefore from this moment develop into an authoritarian movement, I would have been wrong. I mean, it could have been that those elements took over the left, and actually in one or two countries they did.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nThe point is that these movements were, particularly in the United States where we\u2019re cursed with our two party system, these movements are coalitions, and I was simply dissecting what happened to the right-wing coalition or the center right coalition that I felt myself to be a part of and clearly no longer do. I simply don\u2019t think that Trumpism was some kind of inevitability, that it had to be that way because that was the way the party was going. That there are these elements of cultural despair of deep pessimism about American society of fear and anxiety caused by modernity and technological change and social change, that that is all present on the right right now, of course, it\u2019s absolutely true. I write about it all the time, and it\u2019s part of my book. What I don\u2019t agree with is that retrospectively colors all anti-communists as proto-authoritarians, which would be ridiculous.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOh, I don\u2019t think\u2014 no, I mean, I don\u2019t think it retrospectively colors all anti-communists as proto-authoritarians. I just think \u2014 and I think that this comes out in your book \u2014 that the segment of that coalition that was genuinely concerned about human rights and democracy is smaller than, I think, people would have admitted at the time.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI mean, depends on which country, and it depends which time we\u2019re talking about. A lot of this is also to do with who won power and how and when. The anti-liberal or anti-democratic part of the Polish right, for example, was a fringe minority for 25 years, which had very little influence on Polish politics and was not even really visible. And even the Law and Justice party, which is now the ruling party, it was very briefly in power once before for a year and a half, and it exhibited a much more limited and narrow and less ambitious version of what it\u2019s doing now. It was still then a coalition that contained a wide range of people. Even the Law and Justice president, who was the one who died in the tragic plane crash, was somebody who cared a lot about the rule of law, for example, and polish judges and so on, and it\u2019s hard to imagine him presiding over this destruction of the judicial system that\u2019s taking place now. So that\u2019s around 2005. Even then, they were the truly anti-democratic anti-pluralist piece of the party was a fringe piece of the extreme. And that it has now moved to the center is the drama of the current story.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, I kept on wondering as I was reading you, when you look at the group of you on the right, conservatives, however you want to call yourselves, when you look at your kind of wide group of friends and acquaintances, not just in Poland, but also in Britain and the United States, and I assume you had some in Hungary as well, and you kind of observe who drifted readily, or at least eventually, toward the lure of authoritarianism or some of these more nativist administrations or governments, and who, like you, resisted or like the Never Trumpers here, what are the kind of character or logical or socioeconomic differences, what distinguishes the people who decided to go along versus the people who said, no way?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo first of all, to be clear, there are no sociological differences. I mean, we are talking about elite people. We\u2019re talking about educated sophisticated people who were not damaged by Poland\u2019s post-communist resurgence. Quite the contrary. I hesitate to generalize because one of the things I liked about this book is that, unlike as in writing columns, I didn\u2019t really have to generalize. I could just focus on a few people. But very often in Poland, a lot of the people that I\u2019m talking about are people who, for one reason or another, became dissatisfied. I mean, so for example, in Poland with the post-communist state. And sometimes they were dissatisfied for political reasons, and often they were dissatisfied for personal reasons. So they personally had not prospered to the degree to which they felt they should have done.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nAnd so there is a quality of resentment, a feeling that the wrong people have risen to power, the wrong people are achieving prominence. Our business class is not the right kind of people. So there\u2019s a feeling that the wrong people have somehow won or are somehow in charge. And you can look back through history, and the sort of classic profile of the revolutionary is somebody who\u2019s part of the elite, but not on top. So look at Lenin. Lenin came from the Russian aristocracy, but the lowest rung of the aristocracy, right? And then his family even dropped out of the aristocracy after his brother was sentenced as a revolutionary, and he has fantastic resentment, even though he\u2019s not from the working class. He\u2019s not the poorest part of the country, but he has this feeling of resentment against Russia\u2019s rulers. OK, the Russian revolution is a more complicated story than that. It wasn\u2019t all about Lenin\u2019s personal psychosis. I don\u2019t want to keep going with that analogy. I\u2019m just saying that if you do look back, you do find that a lot of radicals often fit that profile. And I think even in the U.S., Laura Ingraham, who I write about at some length, isn\u2019t somebody that I do know that well. She doesn\u2019t really count as a friend. She was just somebody I met a few times. And we have some mutual friends and so on, but I\u2019m not close to her. But she is somebody who I know was always very resentful of the fact that her achievements weren\u2019t more recognized. So she also has that quality of resenting the elite, which she is also somehow part of. I mean, to say that she\u2019s not an elite is ridiculous. I mean, she\u2019s \u2014\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nDid you ever read her book about what an elite is?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI read several of her books. I can\u2019t remember.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nShe wrote this book in 2003 where she basically defines elitism as a state of mind that sort of has nothing to do\u2014\n\nanne applebaum\n\nWith your actual\u2014\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\n\u2014with class.\n\nanne applebaum\n\n\u2014class. Yeah, right. Right.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo it\u2019s kind of this bizarre fantasmagorical version of elitism in which a person with the right politics can never, by definition, be part of the elite.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nRight. So she has defined herself as somebody \u2014 even though she\u2019s extremely wealthy, television presenter with millions of social media followers and a huge fan base, and a large house and all that, she nevertheless defines herself as being somehow anti-elite, which is, of course, ridiculous.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nRight.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nIf you\u2019re asking what people like that have in common, this is often it. There\u2019s some element of resentment or a feeling of outsiderism.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut do you think she\u2019s changed? Because in your book, you sort of associate her with this optimistic post-Cold War milieu of Reaganism and people who felt like we won, and now we\u2019re going to go on to keep winning. Whereas when I look at her history, I mean, starting with Dartmouth where she is the editor of this school newspaper with Dinesh D\u2019Souza, where they become famous for trying to humiliate gay students by sending an undercover reporter to the gay student group\u2019s meeting and publishing excerpts of things that people talked about. Her book in 2003 is obviously extremely resentful and nationalist. I guess I don\u2019t see a Laura Ingraham that was at one point different or better than the one that we see today.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nNo, I\u2019m not sure that Laura Ingraham was ever different or better. Her views about the world have certainly changed. I mean, she has a much different view of American foreign policy. She has a different analysis of American history than she once had. I\u2019m not intimate with her. I don\u2019t know her well enough to tell you exactly all the components of it, although I tease it apart a little bit in the book. But that she was an anti-communist at a time when other people on the left weren\u2019t is true. And so I probably gave her more credit for that than she deserved in the \u201880s and \u201890s. But to me, that was a really important quality, and it remained an important quality for me for a long time.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, I want to say something very cynical and ask something very cynical, but these last years have made me pretty cynical, which is, you used the verb \u201cprospered\u201d before. You were just talking about Laura Ingraham\u2019s views have changed. I find myself wondering as we talk about resentment as a motivating factor, the size of the chip on someone\u2019s shoulder, to what extent do they actually have convictions that change in ideologies, or are they just grabbing onto the winning formula that puts them on the top of the team or in the winner\u2019s circle or make sure that they prosper? I mean, are they just kind of choosing horses rather than, in fact, evolving ideologically?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSome of them. I mean, some of them are deeply cynical. So one other person who I talk about in the book who won\u2019t be familiar to American listeners is a Hungarian woman called Maria Schmidt, whom I suspect of deep and profound cynicism. She\u2019s somebody who has a number of both business and political interests in Hungary, and she\u2019s made great efforts to stay on the right side of the current ruling party and is now one of their chief propagandists, even though I know that in earlier eras she was more doubtful about them. And I suspect her of being profoundly cynical. So one of the things that I tried to argue in the book is that, again, the human personality is very complex, and people can be motivated by more than one thing. And some people are motivated by an idealism or an ideology or politics, and some people are motivated by personal ambition. Some people are motivated by resentment. Some people are motivated by the pleasure in seeing their enemies squirm. And some people are, as you say, profoundly cynical, and sometimes those qualities dominate at different moments. I mean, I actually end the book with this discussion of cynicism and nihilism, and I say that this is the really dangerous sentiment for liberal democracy is that. Because once people become cynical and once they think it\u2019s all a game and it doesn\u2019t matter who wins, then you do begin to lose the virtue of the state, and then you really are open for all kinds of extreme politics. But yeah, I mean, are they cynical? Some of them really are, yes.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut there\u2019s also a relationship, right, between kind of doubt and fanaticism. If you\u2019re going to insist on something that on some level you know it not to be true, it\u2019s likely to make you more histrionic and more sort of uncompromising.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI think there\u2019s a quote in the book that I\u2019m not going to be able to recite to you off the top of my head, but it\u2019s a quote actually that comes from a guy who was a young communist in Poland in the 1940s, Jacek Trzynadel. And he described in a famous memoir that he wrote years later, he described what it felt like to be talking to a crowd of people. People are shouting and cheering, and he was lecturing the crowd whatever, support our Marxist state. I mean, I\u2019m just making up what he said. I don\u2019t remember the exact thing. And he writes, the more I was shouting, the more I was doubting what I was saying. Did I really believe what I was shouting? And I felt I had to shout louder not just to convince the crowd, but to convince myself.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nI think I was talking a little bit about something else, which is just rank opportunism. We were talking moments ago about Laura Ingraham. One of her Fox News colleagues Tucker Carlson, if you go back and you listen to Tucker Carlson 15, 20 years ago, he doesn\u2019t sound exactly or really all that much like he sounds now. And his voice has evolved in relationship to where he\u2019s gotten the largest audience, the most traction, the most power. And Donald Trump, I mean, does any one of us really believe that Donald Trump has an intrinsic and abiding ideology versus a set of hunches and instincts about which direction to turn in to maximize the adulation and the purchase on power?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nBut actually, Frank, I mean, I would say I actually think that racism is pretty deep in Donald Trump and is as close to a sincere belief as he\u2019s possible of holding.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo actually, Tucker Carlson, who I didn\u2019t write about, but is probably a better example, as you say, of somebody who has changed very profoundly. David Frum has a thesis about Carlson, which is that it was because what he really, really, really, really always wanted to do was be on television and be good at television. He tried various television projects, and they kept failing. And then finally, he hit on the formula that would win him millions of fans, and that was this kind of strange racist, nationalist, nativist language that is designed to appeal to mobs of like thinkers in America and that that was what finally brought him fame and glory, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s sticking with it. And so, yes, that would be an example of really sort of pure opportunism and a kind of nihilism. And that, as I say, is one of the enemies of good politics.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nBut where would you put Trump, Anne? Is Trump more Tucker or more Lenin? [GOLDBERG AND APPLEBAUM LAUGH]\n\nanne applebaum\n\nActually, a bit of \u2014 [LAUGHS] golly, that\u2019s not a question I ever thought I was going to have to answer.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nIt\u2019s not a question I ever thought I\u2019d ask. [BOTH LAUGH]\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo, I mean, actually, you can see elements of both. I mean, think about it. Trump is somebody who he\u2019s very rich. He\u2019s on the front page of tabloids. And yet, is he ever really accepted by the New York elite who he resents? Is he accepted by the real movers and shakers, the real bankers and businessmen in New York? Do they see him as a real player? I mean, no, they don\u2019t. I mean, for all I know, he may be deeply resentful of the people who look down on him because he was vulgar and so on. So he may well fit into that sort of, in that sense, the Leninist category, and at the same time be someone who, as Michelle said, is somebody who just has this instinct for kind of negative publicity. He understands how to move crowds and how to appeal to really base instincts. So he\u2019s somebody you can see both of those aspects in.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNow, one of the things that I think is really valuable about your book is its kind of international scope. So it\u2019s not just about what happened to the Republican Party. But to me, one of the questions that keeps \u2014 this may be a provincial question, but compared to maybe if Hungary is the worst case scenario out of all of the countries that you\u2019re writing about in this book, possibly followed by Poland, these are both countries where, as you write about, there\u2019s sort of a conspiracy at the very center of the government. Where do you see the United States on that trajectory? How far are we from Poland, or how far are we from Victor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo this may sound very bizarre, and I accept that it\u2019s my own weird provincialism, and it\u2019s my strange perspective as an American who lives at least part of the time in Poland. I think the United States and Poland are really similar in the sense that I do think that Trump came to power also on the back of a conspiracy that all of us \u2014 including me, but also many other people \u2014 underrated, which was the conspiracy of birtherism. And it\u2019s now sort of forgotten because so many things have happened, that this was the moment when he really broke into national politics was by being the kind of the loudest spokesman for birtherism. And what was birtherism? It was the argument that the president of the United States is illegitimate. He\u2019s not even American. And this argument had a tremendous amount of power and was believed by an enormous number of people. I saw a statistic once, it\u2019s between 20 percent and 30 percent of Americans believed this to be true. Now, think about what that means. If the president is illegitimate, that means that everybody \u2014 the media, the courts, the Congress, the civil service \u2014 everybody is lying to you. So the entire state is covering up this fact that the president is an illegal outsider and should not be president at all. If you believe that, OK, then you are ready for all kinds of radical changes and all kinds of radical politics because you have come to doubt all of the institutions of your democracy.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOh, that\u2019s really interesting. So that creates much more of a kind of \u2014 I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve thought before that there is such a through line between birtherism and then the deep state conspiracy.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nOh, absolutely. No, no, I mean, the use of conspiracy theories and conspiracy thinking by Trump is very similar to the way this was used in Poland and where it\u2019s been used in other places. And by the way, throughout history, OK? The Bolsheviks were great conspiracy theorists. And the way in which he used it and the way in which he has consistently sought to undermine public trust in a range of institutions \u2014 the deep state, the fake news media, the judges who are really Mexicans, they\u2019re not Americans \u2014 all that language used over and over. Some of it I think he does in a calculating way and some of it is instinctive. I mean, this is genuinely, I think, probably how he sees the world. All of this has built up and amplified the existing lack of trust in American society and helped to undermine people\u2019s faith in institutions. I mean, if you think American democracy is so rotten that we had a president for eight years who wasn\u2019t even American and it was all lied to us, then you\u2019re willing to see all kinds of things overthrown. Then what do you care about the State Department being decimated or the Inspector General of the C.I.A. being fired? Why should you care? All those people, it\u2019s so obvious that all of it is corrupt. And this is something that Trumpism has in common with the way politics are done not just in Poland, but in Brazil and in many other countries.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, I ask you this because you are a student, a scholar of authoritarians and authoritarianism, and because I suspect it\u2019s a question that\u2019s on a lot of our listeners\u2019 minds. Donald Trump, let\u2019s say he loses in early November. Do you think there\u2019s a real possibility that he rejects the results? And what does that look like? And if he wins, what do you suspect the next four years look like?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo those are two different questions. I mean, first of all, I think it\u2019s almost certain that he is going to question the results. He\u2019s said so already. He\u2019s been asked point blank, will you accept the result? And he\u2019s refused to say yes. So I think that is a clear possibility. It\u2019s something everybody should be prepared for. It may be that there is a very easy solution to that if it happens, and the solution is I think Biden himself has said, well, on January the 20th, he\u2019ll walk into the White House, and the Secret Service will escort Mr. Trump out because Trump will have trouble fighting the legality of it. But that doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t cause an enormous amount of trouble or do an enormous amount of damage by campaigning around the country between November and January and saying that the election was rigged and seek once again to use conspiracy theory to move people and prepare them for some other political project still to come. And so, yes, it\u2019s possible. But I should also say that I also think it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll try to cheat in other ways. I mean, I think the attempt to undermine absentee ballots, the hints that he might undermine the work of the post office so that it couldn\u2019t deliver absentee ballots, I mean, all of that is preparing both to try and cheat and to prevent people from voting, and also to begin to make the case that the election was rigged. So it is highly possible he\u2019ll do that. Second question \u2014 well, no, sorry, your second question was about what if he wins.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nIf he wins, is that it? Are we on a fast track, an express train to authoritarianism?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo if he wins, I mean, the main difference between Trump\u2019s first term and Trump\u2019s second term will be the kinds of people working for him. Because if you remember, in the early part of his presidency, there were still people working for him who believed they were there to do something good and they were there to protect the institutions of the United States. And although I\u2019ve criticized James Mattis, I do accept that he thought that what he was doing there was making sure that the army was OK and that elements of U.S. foreign policy, like our relationship with allies, were maintained. And a number of people who worked for Trump in the beginning had that commitment to the institutions and to democracy. In Trump\u2019s second term, there will be no such people. And so the government, the institutions will be run by people who are intent on destroying what they can and who will do so rather aggressively. And yes, I do think that would cause an enormous crisis in American democracy.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nThe other scenario is Biden wins, Trump leaves voluntarily or is escorted out. What then happens to the authoritarian fervor that he has cultivated during his four years when he\u2019s out of office?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo this is a really interesting question, and one that I have been talking to people about. Most think that \u2014 and these are mostly ex-Republicans, but people who know the party quite well \u2014 most people think that everything depends on how he loses. So if he loses by a lot, if it\u2019s a wipeout, if the Republican Party loses the Senate and if it loses even more seats in the House, then it is possible that a part of the party leadership will say we\u2019re right, that was a big disaster, and that was a really bad idea. And Trumpism was a road to nowhere, and it\u2019s a road to an ever-shrinking base. And therefore, there will be an election or an argument inside the party, and a new kind of leader will be chosen. And then as somebody said to me recently, and then there\u2019s at least a chance that we get rid of this authoritarian or we push to the fringes this authoritarian streak in the Republican Party. It doesn\u2019t mean that we will, but it means that then there\u2019s a chance. If the election is very close, on the other hand, if Trump loses very slightly, if the Republicans retain the Senate, and if the party still feels that this kind of rhetoric and this kind of language is a winning ticket, then the next presidential candidate may well be Tucker Carlson or Don Jr. [BRUNI LAUGHS] or Ivanka or someone who \u2014\n\nfrank bruni\n\nSo if it\u2019s Tom Cotton, we\u2019re lucky, right?\n\nanne applebaum\n\nIf it\u2019s Tom Cotton, you\u2019re lucky.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nThat\u2019s actually \u2014 [APPLEBAUM LAUGHS]\n\nanne applebaum\n\nOr Mike Pompeo. I mean \u2014\n\nfrank bruni\n\nUgh.\n\nanne applebaum\n\n\u2014 there\u2019s a range of people who will be competing for the role of the next and possibly more efficient and more intelligent Trumpist leader. And so then we are in a real national conundrum because then we have one political party which is not dedicated to playing by the rules of the game, and then the kind of polarization that we\u2019ve had will continue and get worse. And then we will find ourselves in the position of having every four years a kind of electoral moment of crisis.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo obviously, a lot of these trends that we\u2019re talking about in other countries predate the election of Donald Trump. But I\u2019m curious how you think the \u2014 I mean, collapse isn\u2019t the right word, but the kind of damage incurred to the ideal of liberal democracy in America has empowered authoritarianism in other countries and how the sort of fate of this election will then\u2014 the echoes that will have in other countries that have basically argued that liberal democracy has failed, that it was a joke, that its time is over.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nSo the election of Donald Trump, the re-election of Donald Trump, would have an enormous negative impact around the world, and it would absolutely empower other authoritarians, both sitting ones, whether in Russia or in China, for that matter, or in the Middle East, as well as aspiring ones in other countries that are current democracies. And this is both by the power of example. Trump and his language are quoted and imitated by people all over the world. I mean, for example, his use of the expression \u201cfake news\u201d to undermine the media is one that has been picked up and repeated by dozens of other authoritarian leaders or would-be authoritarian leaders. I mean, the other part of the story is that the authoritarian right, the new radical right around the world has deep links. There are deep financial links. There are deep links, kind of organic links on social media. These groups of people speak to one another. They share one another\u2019s memes. They communicate in different ways across borders. And the influence of the American alt-right on the European far right or the international alt-right is quite profound and vice versa. I think they influence one another. And there is no question that the re-election of Donald Trump would embolden and motivate those different groups who, as I say, are speaking to one another all the time anyway and help them propagate their ideas further.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, can I ask you a meta question, so to speak? In the very title of your book Twilight of Democracy and I think sort of the subtext of a lot of the discussion that we\u2019re all having here today is this notion that the trend line is away from democracy. The trend line is toward, very scarily, authoritarianism. I just want to kind of play devil\u2019s advocate maybe in a very hopeful vein. Poland just had an election. I believe\u2014 you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 was the closest election since the end of communism. And in fact, the authoritarian government barely won. You go back to 2016. Trump got almost 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton did in the popular vote. He won only after Russian interference, only after a late in the game assist from Jim Comey, and possibly also because so many people were so convinced the outcome was predetermined in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor that they didn\u2019t rouse themselves to vote. And since then, almost every metric, almost every measure, almost every election has suggested the limits of Trump\u2019s appeal. Is it possible that what we\u2019re seeing in Poland and what we\u2019re seeing in America is, at the end of the day, a blip, he asked hopefully.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nI mean, maybe. I, too, hope that that\u2019s the correct interpretation. And our country and other countries have overcome even worse crises before. I mean, the Civil War was a pretty big blip on the history of American democracy. It was a moment of total collapse, and somehow we nevertheless recovered from that with some caveats. I think one of the reasons I wrote the book and one of the reasons I concluded it the way I did is that what I don\u2019t want is for Americans to become complacent, for us to say, well, our democracy is so great and so strong and our Constitution is so fantastic, and we\u2019re a superpower. I don\u2019t have to try that hard to make sure that everything goes well in our country, and it\u2019s all going to go back to how it was eventually. And anyway, Poland is far away, and they are central Europeans, and they have nothing to do with us. I mean, I really believe that it is that conviction of inevitability which was the big mistake, I should say, of my entourage or my milieu, my friends in the \u201890s. There was a kind of complacency that now that we\u2019re on this road to democracy, nothing can take us back. Because that is wrong. Countries do reverse themselves, and they do cease to be democracies. And we are going through a really extraordinary moment of technological and informational and demographic and social change, and changes make society very volatile and all kinds of outcomes are possible. And I don\u2019t want people to be complacent or certain that we will somehow go back to everything being the way it was before, and you don\u2019t have to really do anything about it or worry about it. because it\u2019s that feeling of inevitability that turned out to be wrong.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I think we will end it there. And even though we have some disagreements about the nature of pre-Trump conservatism, it was a pleasure to read \u201cThe Twilight of Democracy.\u201d It\u2019s a fascinating book, and I\u2019m thrilled that you came on the show. Thank you so much.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnne, thank you so much for your time and your thoughtfulness.\n\nanne applebaum\n\nOh, thanks for talking to me. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAnd we\u2019re back. Michelle, what did you think?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I think that she\u2019s extraordinarily brilliant obviously. And it\u2019s often funny when you disagree with someone on Twitter in a column, and then you end up talking and you find out you agree more than you might have thought. And I should say that Anne Applebaum is someone who her willingness to kind of call out authoritarianism on the right certainly didn\u2019t begin with Trump. Something I probably should have brought up is that she was at one time a big fan of John McCain, who refused to vote for him, I think very honorably, in 2008 because he put Sarah Palin on the ticket, right? And Sarah Palin\u2019s rise to prominence was in a lot of ways a premonition of what we\u2019re living through now. And so one of the things that is so interesting about this moment is how you end up being in political coalitions with people that you never could have imagined, right? It\u2019s such a reminder of how long life is. That it would have been hard enough for me to imagine maybe being on the same side as Anne Applebaum in 2000 or 2003, never mind David Frum and Bill Kristol. But one of the things I wrote in my piece is that I think a lot of people on the left are very, very suspicious of Never Trump conservatives, and I really admire them because they\u2019ve really sacrificed something to stand up to him. And they\u2019ve sacrificed more than I\u2019ve had to or more than people on the left have had to just in terms of the fissuring of personal relationships, professional networks, right? I mean, I think it\u2019s really not easy to turn your back on the social and political world that you\u2019ve lived your whole life in.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nWhat you just described or what you just talked about is actually where I get my hope during these dark times. And what I mean by that is, you\u2019re right, you and Anne Applebaum agree more than you disagree, and that becomes clear when you talk with each other, and you have made temporary whatever kind of partnership with people whom you didn\u2019t expect to. I think that if I\u2019m going to be an optimist, one thing that could come out of all of this \u2014 and our conversation with Anne reacquainted me with this optimism \u2014 is that we can focus on what unites us more than what divides us. Understanding what a threat Trump is, being so deeply offended by some of the divisions he\u2019s exploited and the ways he\u2019s governed has reminded so many people from various points of the political spectrum of what they have in common and of how overlapping their fundamental values are in so many ways. Don\u2019t you think?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI guess, but I really wonder if that\u2019s more of an elite phenomenon, right? That sort of people who make their living by kind of arguing and writing in the search for truth and good faith argumentation are sort of necessarily in this moment on the same side. Instead of kind of politics\u2014 I\u2019ve written this before. Instead of politics being a war of ideas, the people who takes ideas seriously are aside in politics. I think if you look at the country as a whole, I don\u2019t see how you look out at America right now and say that this is a country where people are more aware of what unites them than divides them. I mean, to me, it looks like a country that\u2019s coming apart at the seams.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nI mean, it looks and feels that way. And yet, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just an elite phenomenon. I mean, if I flash back over the last couple of years, once Trump had been in office for a while and the offenses had mounted and mounted and mounted, the number of times somebody in a store, in a fast food restaurant, wherever, has kind of set an aside, an aside of disgust that lets me know that they\u2019ve developed the same reservations or deep concerns that someone writing op-ed pieces and simply using a different vocabulary is expressing. I mean, that happens all the time. And I look more recently \u2014 and I think this has been so fascinating and hopeful \u2014 I look at the polls regarding how Americans feel about Black Lives Matter and where that puts them in opposition to Trump, and I see an overwhelming majority of Americans coming together with the same idea of justice and rejecting Donald Trump. And \u2014\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nNo, I think you\u2019re right that Donald Trump has created \u2014 and I think Jemele wrote about this, right, that Donald Trump has created, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a silent majority, but he\u2019s definitely created a fairly solid anti-Trump majority.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nAgain, when I want to wear my optimist hat, I think Donald Trump in the long run, if things turn out better and not worse, I think Donald Trump has shown us who we don\u2019t want to be. At the end of the conversation with Anne, we talked in what I found to be a very fascinating manner about various scenarios. Trump barely loses. Trump loses big. Trump wins. Beyond all of those, there\u2019s a scenario where he loses, we move on. And again, this is my hope. This is me at my most hopeful and optimistic. Call me Pollyanna. We remember what Donald Trump did to us. We remember what he showed us in terms of the kind of America we don\u2019t want to be. And maybe we\u2019re the better for it.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I think that\u2019s certainly a possibility, right? I mean, if you look at all the reforms that you saw after Richard Nixon, I mean, most of them stood up fairly well until Donald Trump dismantled them. But there was not just this huge wave after, this huge Democratic wave that followed Nixon\u2019s resignation, but a whole flurry of lawmaking to try to solidify accountability, solidify transparency, solidify democratic institutions. I think it\u2019s going to be really, really important that people keep pushing on that. When Barack Obama first became president, there were people who wanted some sort of accountability for the people who had both misled the country into war under George W. Bush and also the people responsible for the financial crisis. And I understand why Obama, facing all these interlocking crises, thought that it was the time to sort of look forward rather than backward. But I think that was a mistake in retrospect, and it would be a fatal mistake if, inshallah, Biden becomes president. I think it will be really important to have something\u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, if it\u2019s a commission in the Justice Department \u2014 to sort of expose both the kind of instances of corruption and lawlessness that we maybe half know about. And I\u2019m sure there are a lot that we don\u2019t know about, right? I\u2019m sure there are a lot of utterly corrupt phone calls with foreign leaders as bad as the one with the president of Ukraine that we just haven\u2019t heard about. And so I think it\u2019ll be really, really important to figure out the places where norms need to be replaced by laws.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nI suspect we will be excavating the muck of the Trump administration for decades to come. I just hope that excavation begins sooner rather than later. [GOLDBERG LAUGHS] But we should probably wrap it up there, Michelle. It\u2019s just you and me this week, which means 50/50 chance that you\u2019re going to be the one doing the recommendation. And I just tossed a coin. Heads it\u2019s you. What\u2019s your recommendation this week?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nSo I am going to recommend \u2014 it\u2019s not a new book. I\u2019m going to recommend an old book that I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot recently and that I recently re-read, Milan Kundera\u2019s \u201cThe Joke.\u201d So I don\u2019t know about you, but I have a lot of these books that I feel like have been really formative, and yet at the same time I can barely remember. But I decided to reread \u201cThe Joke\u201d recently because we\u2019ve been, or I\u2019ve been at any rate, embroiled in this discussion over cancel culture, which even though I don\u2019t like the phrase cancel culture, it seems somewhat inescapable, and sort of what it means to be publicly shamed, what it means for a ideological movement to enforce its boundaries. And when I see people kind of cast out, I often think of this book.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nWhat is the storyline of \u201cThe Joke\u201c?\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nOK, so the storyline of \u201cThe Joke\u201d is there is a young communist in Czechoslovakia in the \u201840s, a very ardent communist, but somebody with a sort of slightly ironic temperament, who has a crush on this girl who is kind of earnest to a fault. And he teases her by sending her this jokey postcard \u2014 hold on, I\u2019ll just get the actual line because I have it underlined here. [PAGES FLIPPING] So he teases her by sending her this jokey postcard that says, \u201cOptimism is the opium of the people. A healthy atmosphere stinks of stupidity. Long live Trotsky.\u201d And this postcard, this joke, ends up completely derailing his life. He\u2019s drummed out of the party, drummed out of the university. He\u2019s sent to go work in the mines. So in some ways, this is not at all comparable to what we talk about when we talk about cancellation, right? Because the sort of horror of it is that it has the power of the state behind it. And sometimes I think that people my age and older, those of us who grew up on Milan Kundera and books like it, there are certain rhetorical modes that signal to us authoritarianism. And we see them on Twitter and maybe overreact because what was so frightening about them was that they had the power of the state behind them. And yet at the same time, I think he sort of really captures the emotional experience, or what I imagine to be the emotional experience, of being sort of drummed out of a movement that you identify with. Because the significant thing about Ludvik is that he really is a communist, and so he really does identify with the people who are casting him out. He doesn\u2019t really want to be a dissident. I\u2019ll just quote this line: \u201cI came to realize that there was no power capable of changing the image of my person lodged somewhere in the supreme court of human destinies. But this image, even though it bore no resemblance to me, was much more real than my actual self, that I was its shadow and not it mine.\u201d I think that line captures some of what happens when people become reduced to either the worst thing that they\u2019ve ever said or someone\u2019s impression of the worst thing that they ever said.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nIt\u2019s so interesting to hear you describe it, Michelle, because one of the more celebrated novels to come out in the last six months and one of the novels I most recently read is called \u201cA Burning.\u201d I\u2019m going to probably mispronounce the author\u2019s name, for which I apologize, but her name is Megha Majumdar, and it\u2019s set in India. And I\u2019m realizing how timeless, what stamina the story you\u2019re describing from \u201cThe Joke\u201d has. It is, again, about someone who, with a single communication, miscommunication, call it what you will, is branded forevermore and becomes a convenient object of analysis, demonization, caricature, whatever, for the society around her. So this is clearly a story that, regardless of epoch of decade, speaks to certain eternal verities of human nature.\n\nmichelle goldberg\n\nI had heard of that book, but I hadn\u2019t realized that that was what it was about. But now I\u2019m gonna \u2014 we can make that a recommendation too because I\u2019m going to order it.\n\nfrank bruni\n\nBut this is your week.

But that idea fizzled quickly, and Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, said that the United States had held \u201celections in this country when we were at war, even when we were in civil war. And we should have the elections on time.\u201d\n\nWhat about the procedures for voting in the November election?\n\nWhile the date of the presidential election is set by federal law, the procedures for voting are generally controlled at the state level.\n\nThat\u2019s why the nation has such a complicated patchwork of voting regulations, with some states allowing early and absentee voting; some permitting voting by mail or same-day voter registration; others requiring certain kinds of identification for voters; and many states doing few or none of those things.\n\nDemocrats included $3.6 billion in their latest coronavirus aid package to help states administer their elections safely during the pandemic. Republicans did not include any such funding in the proposal they rolled out this week.\n\nSeveral states have tried to make it easier for voters to use mail-in ballots this year, helping them to avoid going to polling places on Election Day. In Michigan, for example, the secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, mailed absentee ballot applications to all 7.7 million registered voters for the state\u2019s August primary election and the November general election.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/trump-postpone-election.html", "author": ["Alexander Burns"]}, {"title": "Will Herman Cain\u2019s Death Change Republican Views on the Virus and Masks?", "text": "Yet there have been few indications that the spate of coronavirus cases among Republicans is leading to any kind of major reckoning in the party.

Except this time, there were some cameras there. This time, the world saw what happened, bore witness to Black Americans who were asking for nothing more than to be treated like other Americans. Who were not asking for special treatment, just the equal treatment promised to them a century before, and almost another century before that.\n\nWhen John woke up, and checked himself out of the hospital, he would make sure the world saw a movement that was, in the words of Scripture, \u201chard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.\u201d They returned to Brown Chapel, a battered prophet, bandages around his head, and he said more marchers will come now. And the people came. And the troopers parted. And the marchers reached Montgomery. And their words reached the White House \u2014 and Lyndon Johnson, son of the South, said \u201cWe shall overcome,\u201d and the Voting Rights Act was signed into law.\n\nThe life of John Lewis was, in so many ways, exceptional. It vindicated the faith in our founding, redeemed that faith; that most American of ideas; that idea that any of us ordinary people without rank or wealth or title or fame can somehow point out the imperfections of this nation, and come together, and challenge the status quo, and decide that it is in our power to remake this country that we love until it more closely aligns with our highest ideals. What a radical ideal. What a revolutionary notion. This idea that any of us, ordinary people, a young kid from Troy can stand up to the powers and principalities and say no this isn\u2019t right, this isn\u2019t true, this isn\u2019t just. We can do better. On the battlefield of justice, Americans like John, Americans like the Reverends Lowery and C.T. Vivian, two other patriots that we lost this year, liberated all of us that many Americans came to take for granted.\n\nAmerica was built by people like them. America was built by John Lewises. He as much as anyone in our history brought this country a little bit closer to our highest ideals. And someday, when we do finish that long journey toward freedom; when we do form a more perfect union \u2014 whether it\u2019s years from now, or decades, or even if it takes another two centuries \u2014 John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America.\n\nAnd yet, as exceptional as John was, here\u2019s the thing: John never believed that what he did was more than any citizen of this country can do. I mentioned in the statement the day John passed, the thing about John was just how gentle and humble he was. And despite this storied, remarkable career, he treated everyone with kindness and respect because it was innate to him \u2014 this idea that any of us can do what he did if we are willing to persevere.\n\nHe believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage, that in all of us there is a longing to do what\u2019s right, that in all of us there is a willingness to love all people, and to extend to them their God-given rights to dignity and respect. So many of us lose that sense. It\u2019s taught out of us. We start feeling as if, in fact, that we can\u2019t afford to extend kindness or decency to other people. That we\u2019re better off if we are above other people and looking down on them, and so often that\u2019s encouraged in our culture. But John always saw the best in us. And he never gave up, and never stopped speaking out because he saw the best in us. He believed in us even when we didn\u2019t believe in ourselves. As a Congressman, he didn\u2019t rest; he kept getting himself arrested. As an old man, he didn\u2019t sit out any fight; he sat in, all night long, on the floor of the United States Capitol. I know his staff was stressed.\n\nBut the testing of his faith produced perseverance. He knew that the march is not yet over, that the race is not yet won, that we have not yet reached that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character. He knew from his own life that progress is fragile; that we have to be vigilant against the darker currents of this country\u2019s history, of our own history, with their whirlpools of violence and hatred and despair that can always rise again.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/obama-eulogy-john-lewis-full-transcript.html", "author": ["The New York Times"]}, {"title": "A Quarter of Bangladesh Is Flooded.

I was invited for some reason to speak to a class of young men, and I asked them to describe for me their ideal mate. There were a few polite murmurs about a good sense of humor and fine moral character \u2014 then someone called out, \u201cAnd a good earner!\u201d I cannot tell you how enthusiastic the room became over the \u201cgood earner\u201d qualification.\n\nIt took professional politicians quite a while to notice there was a change going on. Then in 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated then-President Jimmy Carter, it became clear the country had moved on to a whole new political wave. Analysis of the final tallies showed that both sexes favored Reagan, but the women split very narrowly while the men went Republican 55 percent to 36 percent. The gender gap was born, and it really turned into a canyon in 1996, when Bill Clinton won the women\u2019s vote by a wide margin, while men narrowly favored Bob Dole.\n\nThese days, women go to the polls more faithfully than men, and they are more likely to vote Democratic. That doesn\u2019t mean they always win. In 2000, women favored Al Gore for president over George W. Bush, 54-44 percent, while the men went for Bush, 54-43. In 2016, the male voters gave us Donald Trump in an election where the gender gap yawned at 11 points.\n\nBut the power is there. Black women, who\u2019ve fought dual battles against racism and sexism to exercise their right to vote, knocked the socks off Democratic organizers in Alabama in 2017 when they gave long-shot Senate candidate Doug Jones 98 percent of their vote and a victory over Republican former-judge-and-pursuer-of-teenage-girls Roy Moore.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/19th-amendment-women-suffrage.html", "author": ["Gail Collins"]}, {"title": "Opinion | The Last Days of the Tech Emperors?", "text": "On Wednesday, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, opened a half-virtual hearing on \u201cOnline Platforms and Market Power\u201d with a combative opening statement: \u201cOur founders would not bow before a king.

The fact that casinos are treated more generously than movie theaters, concerts, museums and churches handed Alliance Defending Freedom its opening. \u201cThe Free Exercise clause protects the exercise of religion,\u201d the church\u2019s Supreme Court appeal began, adding that \u201cno constitutional provision protects the right to gamble at casinos, eat at restaurants, or frolic at indoor amusement parks.\u201d\n\nThis statement of the case obviously appealed to Justice Alito, who began his 11-page dissent with this observation: \u201cThe Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion. It says nothing about the freedom to play craps or blackjack, to feed tokens into a slot machine, or to engage in any other game of chance.\u201d He added, \u201cBut the governor of Nevada apparently has different priorities.\u201d The state, he said, \u201cblatantly discriminates against houses of worship.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s assume that opening the casinos was a political and economic necessity for the state. But finding a constitutional violation requires more than clever rhetoric. It requires a very precise chain of analysis, a hard climb that Justice Alito failed to make. His burden was to show not simply that churches are limited to 50 people and casinos aren\u2019t, but that the state singled churches out for onerous treatment without reason. Federal District Judge Richard Boulware II, in rejecting the church\u2019s request for an injunction, offered the analysis that Justice Alito\u2019s opinion skipped over:\n\nOther secular entities and activities similar in nature to church services have been subject to similar or more restrictive limitations on their operations. The court notes that church services consist of activities, such as sermons and corporate worship, that are comparable in terms of large numbers of people gathering for an extended period of time to lectures, museums, movie theaters, specified trade/technical schools, nightclubs and concerts. All of these latter activities are also subject to the 50-person cap or remain banned altogether.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s casinos that Nevada singles out for special treatment, not religion.\n\nInvoking the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause, Justice Alito also claimed that the state was discriminating against churches on the basis of their \u201cviewpoint.\u201d \u201cReligion counts as a viewpoint,\u201d he wrote, a sentence I found baffling. Isn\u2019t belief in public health a viewpoint? In any event, he went on: \u201cCompare the directive\u2019s treatment of casino entertainment and church services. Both involve expression, but the directive favors the secular expression in casino shows over the religious expression in houses of worship.\u201d\n\nThe contorted effort to shoehorn this dispute into standard free-speech doctrine was only a prelude to a further charge: that Governor Sisolak \u201chas favored certain speakers over others.\u201d It seems that the governor supported and even took part in a protest after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, a protest that drew more than 50 people and yet was allowed to take place. \u201cRespecting some First Amendment rights is not a shield for violating others,\u201d Justice Alito wrote. In other words, the governor of Nevada is not only anti-religious but a hypocrite as well.\n\nWhy does any of this matter? After all, Justice Alito\u2019s opinion attracted only two other votes. (Justice Gorsuch filed a separate one-paragraph dissent, pithily observing that \u201cthere is no world in which the Constitution permits Nevada to favor Caesars Palace over Calvary Chapel.\u201d)\n\nI think it matters because rhetoric like Justice Alito\u2019s, by design or not, inevitably places the Supreme Court where it least belongs and where it is least qualified to be, at the center of a national debate over how best to protect the American public from a deadly pandemic. It\u2019s beyond dispute that public health has become politicized to a degree that would have been unimaginable just six months ago. Does the court really want to become a part of that politicization by opening its doors to a battle not its own? That even a minority of justices would seize this moment to advance their religious agenda, especially given that agenda\u2019s nearly unqualified success in recent years, is deeply unsettling.\n\n(I\u2019ve been fascinated that some liberal commentators found the dissenting opinions persuasive and the case a close one. I understand the impulse not to appear unduly antagonistic toward religion, but I think that generosity toward the religious claim here loses sight of the broader context in which the dissenting justices were writing.)", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/supreme-court-religion-coronavirus.html", "author": ["Linda Greenhouse"]}, {"title": "The Mysterious Life of Birds Who Never Come Down", "text": "And they are doing more. As Dokter and his colleagues write, migratory birds orient themselves through a complex of interacting compass mechanisms. During vesper flights, swifts have access to them all. At this panoptic height, they can see the scattered patterns of the stars overhead, and at the same time they can calibrate their magnetic compasses, getting their bearings according to the light-polarization patterns that are strongest and clearest in twilit skies. Stars, wind, polarized light, magnetic cues, the distant stacks of clouds a hundred miles out, clear cold air, and below them the hush of a world tilting toward sleep or waking toward dawn. What they are doing is flying so high that they can work out exactly where they are, to know what they should do next. They\u2019re quietly, perfectly, orienting themselves.\n\nThe behavioral ecologist Cecilia Nilsson and her team have discovered that swifts don\u2019t make these flights alone. They ascend as flocks every evening before singly drifting down, while in the morning they fly up alone and return to earth together. To orient themselves correctly, to make the right decisions, they need to pay attention not only to the cues of the world around them but also to one another. Nilsson and her colleagues hypothesize that swifts on their vesper flights are working according to what is called the many-wrongs principle. That is, they\u2019re averaging all their individual assessments in order to reach the best navigational decision. If you\u2019re in a flock, decisions about what to do next are improved if you exchange information with those around you. We can speak to one another; what swifts do is pay attention to what other swifts are doing. And in the end it can be as simple as this: They follow one another.\n\nThe realm of my own life is the quotidian, the everyday, where I sleep and eat and work and think. Until now, I\u2019ve been privileged enough to experience it as a place of relative quiet. It\u2019s a space of rising and falling hopes and worries, costs and benefits, plans and distractions, and it can batter and distract me, just as high winds and rainfall send swifts off-course. Sometimes it\u2019s a hard place to be, but it\u2019s home to me.\n\nThinking about swifts has made me think more carefully about the ways in which I\u2019ve dealt with difficulty. When I was small, I comforted myself with thoughts of layers of rising air; later I hid myself among the whispers of recorded works of fiction, helping myself fall asleep by playing audiobooks on my phone. We all have our defenses. Some of them are self-defeating, but others are occasions for joy: the absorption of a hobby, the writing of a poem, speeding on a Harley, the slow assembly of a collection of records or shells. \u201cThe best thing for being sad,\u201d said T.H. White\u2019s Merlyn, \u201cis to learn something.\u201d As my friend Christina says, all of us have to live our lives most of the time inside the protective structures that we have built; none of us can bear too much reality. And with the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s terrifying grip on the globe, as so many of us cling desperately to the remnants of what we assumed would always be normality \u2014 sometimes in ways that put us, our loved ones and others in danger \u2014 my usual defenses against difficulty have begun to feel uncomfortably provisional and precarious.\n\nSwifts have, of late, become my fable of community, teaching us about how to make right decisions in the face of oncoming bad weather. They aren\u2019t always cresting the atmospheric boundary layer at dizzying heights; most of the time they are living below it in thick and complicated air. That\u2019s where they feed and mate and bathe and drink and are. But to find out about the important things that will affect their lives, they must go higher to survey the wider scene, and there communicate with others about the larger forces impinging on their realm.\n\nNot all of us need to make that climb, just as many swifts eschew their vesper flights because they are occupied with eggs and young \u2014 but surely some of us are required, by dint of flourishing life and the well-being of us all, to look clearly at the things that are so easily obscured by the everyday. To take time to see the things we need to set our courses toward or against; the things we need to think about to know what we should do next. To trust in careful observation and expertise, in its sharing for the common good. When I read the news and grieve, my mind has more than once turned to vesper flights, to the strength and purpose that can arise from the collaboration of numberless frail and multitudinous souls. If only we could have seen the clouds that sat like dark rubble on our own horizon for what they were; if only we could have worked together to communicate the urgency of what they would become.", "link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/magazine/vesper-flights.html", "author": ["Helen Macdonald"]}]}, "cnbc_top_news": {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "articles": [{"title": "European equities higher ahead of euro zone GDP numbers; Nokia up 10%", "text": "European equities traded higher Friday morning as investors monitored corporate earnings and economic data on the last trading session of the month.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 index was up 0.35% with tech and banking stocks leading the gains.

The Southeast Asian country \u2014 which shares a border with China, where the virus first emerged \u2014 had not recorded any locally transmitted cases for more than three months before a 57-year-old resident of the central city of coastal Danang was tested positive for the coronavirus disease on Saturday, said the Vietnamese government. The patient had no travel history domestically or internationally over the past month, the government said. But Reuters reported that tens of thousands of domestic tourists have been on vacation in the coastal city. Authorities are preparing to evacuate the roughly 80,000 tourists in Danang. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc warned on Wednesday that every province and city in the country is at risk of more infections, reported Reuters, citing state broadcaster Vietnam Television.\n\nTo be clear, the 450 total confirmed cases reported in Vietnam as of Wednesday remain relatively small for a nation with a population of around 97 million. The country also has not recorded any deaths relating to the coronavirus. But the renewed outbreak in Vietnam underscores the difficulties governments face in containing the fast-spreading disease. That's the case even for a country that was internationally hailed as a potential model for other developing countries in managing the coronavirus outbreak. The Vietnamese government's online newspaper VGP said on Monday that preliminary epidemiological investigations showed some of the new cases detected in Danang were linked to three hospitals in the city. Genome analysis also revealed that \"this is a new type of Covid-19, which is more infectious,\" said Acting Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long.\n\nAuthorities have tightened containment measures in Danang, such as stepping up contact tracing, limiting crowd sizes and halting non-essential services. Flights to and from the city have also been temporarily suspended. On Wednesday, Vietnam reported new cases in its two biggest cities \u2014 Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City \u2014 which were attributed to people who visited Danang in the last few weeks. Reuters, citing city authorities, reported that around 18,000 people who visited Danang returned to Ho Chi Minh City and another 21,000 went home to Hanoi.

Anthony Kwan l Getty Images\n\nSeveral economists have downgraded their economic forecasts for Hong Kong as the semi-autonomous Chinese territory experiences a surge in coronavirus cases. The uptick in numbers forced authorities to impose stricter social-distancing measures this week. Hong Kong said Wednesday that advance estimates showed its economy shrank by 9% in the second quarter compared to a year ago. That's the city's fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year contraction, according to official data. The government said in a statement that the pandemic remains \"a key threat\" to the global economy and a renewed outbreak locally \"clouded the near-term outlook for domestic economic activity.\"\n\n\"Nonetheless, once the local epidemic is contained again and external environment continues to improve, the Hong Kong economy hopefully will gradually recover in the rest of the year,\" it added. Economists agreed that stricter social-distancing measures imposed after a recent flare up in cases will dampen any economic momentum. But some don't share the government's view that a recovery could come this year.\n\nImpact of stricter coronavirus measures\n\nEconomists at consultancy Capital Economics forecast an 8% contraction in the Hong Kong economy this year \u2014 close to doubling their previous projection of a 4.5% contraction. Capital Economics' latest downward revision is also worse than the government's official forecast for a 4% to 7% contraction in 2020. \"Until a few weeks ago, Hong Kong's economy looked set to start recovering this quarter,\" the economists said in a Wednesday note, pointing to the government's cash handouts of 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($1,290) that looked set to help lift economic activity after being disbursed earlier this month. But the stricter containment measures could \"postpone the recovery in consumption, and put additional pressure on employment and incomes, dampening the boost from the government cash handouts,\" they added. In addition to Capital Economics, Citi also downgraded its forecast for Hong Kong and predicted a full-year economic contraction of 6.3% compared to 5.5% previously.\n\nIris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Dutch bank ING, expects the new social-distancing measures to stay in place for some time as the previous relaxation of restrictions might have contributed to the latest jump in cases. Pang said in a note on Wednesday that she's expecting the Hong Kong economy to shrink by 10% in the third quarter and 5% in the fourth quarter \u2014 bringing the full-year contraction to 8.3%. \"Covid-19 cases have increased in Hong Kong, and there could be many sources that are hard to trace,\" she said. \"The government has tightened further social distancing measures again since the outbreak, which the health department claimed could be due to the previous relaxation of social distancing measures.\" Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam warned this week that the renewed outbreak could overwhelm the city's health-care facilities and cost lives.

Others have warned that even if the risk of severe sickness and death are relatively low for children, the role young people play in spreading the virus is not yet clearly understood and they may act as a carrier that sparks fresh outbreaks.\n\nIn an article published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, professor of education at Harvard, Meira Levinson, along with infectious diseases scientist Dr. Muge Cevik and epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch, writes that reopening schools, especially for elementary students, in the U.S. is both crucial and feasible. However, they add that to do so safely, communities should make every effort to bring outbreaks under control before the reopening of schools.\n\n\"Any region experiencing moderate, high, or increasing levels of community transmission should do everything possible to lower transmission,\" they wrote, adding that other countries have closed nonessential indoor businesses and recreational spaces to bring the outbreak under control. \"Such measures along with universal mask wearing must be implemented now in the United States if we are to bring case numbers down to safe levels for elementary schools to reopen this fall nationwide.\"", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/trump-pushes-to-reopen-schools-says-closures-will-probably-cause-more-death.html", "author": ["Will Feuer"]}, {"title": "Jim Cramer reacts to Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet earnings", "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday reacted to the quarterly reports that four of the five largest publicly traded companies posted after markets closed.

One day prior, the chief executives of each tech titan were summoned before Congress to testify on antitrust claims. Cramer called the House antitrust subcommittee the \"greatest stock-picking research firm in the world\" after lawmakers on both sides of the aisle grilled the company heads on their business practices and outsized dominance in their respective markets. \"When I'm searching for long-term investments,\" Cramer said, \"I dream of finding companies that [are] so powerful [and] so strong, that they end up being hauled in front of Congress for destroying their competition fair and square.\"\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon shares surged more than 5% in the aftermarket after the e-commerce giant reported earnings of $10.30 per share on revenue of $88.91 billion, well above the $1.46 per share and $81.56 billion numbers, respectively, analysts were looking for. \"They weren't even trying to have an incredibly profitable quarter. They spent aggressively to build capacity for the stay-at-home economy, and to keep their employees safe,\" Cramer said. \"As for the next quarter, Amazon gave you a blowout forecast. The stock's on fire.\"\n\nApple\n\nApple stock shot up about 6% after posting a blockbuster report and announcing a four-for-one stock split after the bell. The company recorded $59.69 billion on the top line, compared to analyst estimates of $52.25 billion, and $2.58 per share on the bottom line, a 54-cent beat. \"While Apple didn't give us a forecast for the next quarter, they did give us \u2026 a four-for-one stock split, which should make this one a lot more enticing to home-gamers who might be scared away from a $400-plus price tag,\" the host said. \"Many other companies should actually watch what [CEO] Tim Cook does here and stop watching what Warren Buffett does. Do what Tim Cook does. It's another reason why Apple is zooming after hours.\"\n\nFacebook\n\nShares of Facebook rallied above 6% after besting analyst estimates in the second quarter. The social media giant reported earnings of $1.80 per share, when Wall Street was looking for $1.39, on revenues o $18.69 billion, more than $1 billion above expectations. \"After all the sturm und drang about major advertisers boycotting the platform, Facebook shot the lights out,\" Cramer said. \"Even better, July's going strong.

No wonder the stock's flying in after-hours trading.\"\n\nAlphabet\n\nGoogle-parent Alphabet is the laggard here with its stock up less than 1% in extended trading. The online behemoth beat on the top and bottom lines, but the company saw revenues decline for the first time in its history. Alphabet brought in $38.30 billion in revenue and produced profits of $10.13 per share, while analysts predicted $37.37 billion and $8.21, respectively. \"Their numbers were substantially better than expected, even as their core advertising business took a major hit,\" the former hedge fund manager said. \"The stock barely budged in response, but I think that's because Alphabet's management is so non-promotional.\"", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/jim-cramer-reacts-to-amazon-apple-facebook-and-alphabet-earnings.html", "author": ["Tyler Clifford"]}, {"title": "Zuckerberg says there's 'no end in sight' for Facebook employees working from home", "text": "The founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the 56th Munich Security Conference in Munich, southern Germany, on February 15, 2020.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday said there is no timetable for when employees will return to the company's offices amid a continuing surge in Covid-19 cases in the U.S.\n\nZuckerberg made his comments on a call with analysts about Facebook's second-quarter results, specifically criticizing the Trump Administration for its handling of the coronavirus.\n\n\"With Covid growing quickly in the U.S., there's currently no end in sight for when our teams here will be able to return to our offices,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It is incredibly disappointing because it seems like the U.S. could've avoided this current surge in cases if our government had handled this better.\"\n\nThis is not the first time Zuckerberg criticized President Trump for his handling of Covid-19.

I think you saw in those answers what the actual problem for Congress [is] -- a lot of breaking companies up or heavily regulating them, they were talking a lot about competition, but also about consumer benefit. Under current antitrust doctrine, if you're providing a benefit to consumers, then it's very tough to argue for action to break you up, to change your business practice. That is the key thing.

Not very much talk about consumers.\"\n\nJason Ware, partner at Albion Financial Group, said new rules does not change the investment thesis for these tech companies.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is there were very few direct hits placed on these companies by members of the House committee. The big risk to owning any of these tech companies, these large tech companies, is outright breakup. I think higher regulation or bigger hurdles in regulation just means it's more difficult to compete against them if you're a small or midsized company.

I do think the conversation between Congressman Jayapal and [Amazon CEO Jeff] Bezos did surface new information to the public. That gives people a window into how these decisions are made, but they all are part of a broader fabric as to whether or not just because the price for the service is apparently free on the retail sense of the word, that there may be still harm and as a result, triggering the potential for intervention.

Less is known about the organization's List of World Heritage in Danger. This list designates 53 World Heritage sites under threat of \"serious and specific dangers\" due to factors such as environmental change, structural degradation, armed conflict and neglect. In collaboration with insurance company Budget Direct, London-based creative agency NeoMam Studios worked with Serbian and Turkish architects to digitally reconstruct several UNESCO sites on this list. Using computer-generated renderings and animations, the sites are returned to a point in time that looks very different from what we see today.\n\nLeptis Magna in Libya\n\nLeptis Magna was added to UNESCO's list of endangered sites in 2016. Courtesy of Budget Direct\n\nForgotten for over 900 years, the ancient city of Leptis Magna was once considered to be one of the most beautiful cities in the Roman Empire. The Mediterranean city flourished under the reign of native-born Septimius Severus who, following the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, became the Roman emperor from 193 to 211. Like many Roman cities, Leptis Magna had a theater. This one, the oldest Roman theater in Africa, was dug into a low hill and included five flights of steps made from natural stone and concrete. It is believed that the structure was once decorated with hundreds of statues (133 have been identified), yet only two remain intact today. Located in what is now northern Libya, the site is primarily under threat due to environmental reasons such as flooding and plant overgrowth. Ongoing warfare and tourism (in this case, a lack thereof) exacerbate these problems.\n\nOld City of Jerusalem and its Walls\n\nThe Second Temple on the Temple Mount, as it may have looked following Herod the Great's refurbishment. Courtesy of Budget Direct\n\nThe Old City is a .35-square-mile walled area inside modern-day Jerusalem that contains some of the most important religious sites in the world, including the Temple Mount, the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Today, the portion shown here, the Temple Mount, is marked by the gold-roofed Dome of the Rock, which dates to 692 A.D. Before it, Solomon's Temple (the First Temple) and the Second Temple stood, until the latter was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. A remnant of the Second Temple complex exists today, a portion of a retaining wall \u2014 commonly known as the Western Wall or Wailing Wall \u2014 which is one of the most sacred sites in the world for Jewish people today. After being proposed by Jordan, the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls were added to UNESCO's \"in danger\" list in 1982, just one year after being named to the World Heritage List.\n\nPalmyra in Syria\n\nExperts believe that new technology will help reconstruct destroyed parts of Palymyra's Temple of Bel. Courtesy of Budget Direct\n\nOriginally a great caravan oasis for traders from Persia, China, India and the Roman Empire, the city of Palmyra made headlines in 2015 after it was captured by the Islamic State (IS) during the Syrian Civil War. The militant group destroyed ancient sites, conducted mass executions in a Roman-era theater and beheaded Syrian archaeologist Khaled al-Asaad, the head of antiquities of Palmyra, when he reportedly refused to reveal the location of the city's hidden antiquities. The Temple of Bel, shown here, did not survive the onslaught. In this digital rebuild, the \"before\" is what remained of the structure before IS demolished it. A lone archway (in the back) and a portion of a pillar is all that stands today.\n\nNan Madol in Micronesia\n\nThe partially-sunken city of Nan Madol, which thrived from 1200 to 1700, has been called the \"Venice of the Pacific.\" Courtesy of Budget Direct\n\nIt's been described as a destination cut straight from an Indiana Jones movie. Nan Madol is an abandoned city built atop a lagoon that contains over 90 man-made islands and a canal system. Carbon dating estimates construction began in the 12th century (about the same time as Cambodia's Angkor Wat), though little is known as to how the local Saudeleur population moved the heavy volcanic basalt rocks to create the stone palaces, temples and tombs of the lost water city. Local legend attributes it to magic, though scholars believe they were likely floated from the other side of the island. Not widely known and not necessarily easy to get to \u2014 you've got to fly to Pohnpei, Micronesia, drive an hour outside of the main town of Kolonia and then walk through a watery mangrove forest to reach it \u2014 the area saw an increase in tourism when it was named to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2016. Almost immediately, it was placed on the danger list due to coastal erosion, rising sea levels, silt accumulation in the canals and encroaching mangrove roots that are disturbing the ancient architecture.\n\nPortobelo-San Lorenzo fortifications in Panama\n\nPanama's Fort San Lorenzo is subject to environmental threats caused by humidity and soil erosion from the Chagres River.

Sharp contractions in personal consumption, exports, inventories, investment and spending by state and local governments converged to bring down GDP, which is the combined tally of all goods and services produced during the period. Personal consumption, which historically has accounted for about two-thirds of all activity in the U.S., subtracted 25% from the Q2 total, with services accounting for nearly all that drop.

The Southeast Asian country \u2014 which shares a border with China, where the virus first emerged \u2014 had not recorded any locally transmitted cases for more than three months before a 57-year-old resident of the central city of coastal Danang was tested positive for the coronavirus disease on Saturday, said the Vietnamese government. The patient had no travel history domestically or internationally over the past month, the government said. But Reuters reported that tens of thousands of domestic tourists have been on vacation in the coastal city. Authorities are preparing to evacuate the roughly 80,000 tourists in Danang. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc warned on Wednesday that every province and city in the country is at risk of more infections, reported Reuters, citing state broadcaster Vietnam Television.\n\nTo be clear, the 450 total confirmed cases reported in Vietnam as of Wednesday remain relatively small for a nation with a population of around 97 million. The country also has not recorded any deaths relating to the coronavirus. But the renewed outbreak in Vietnam underscores the difficulties governments face in containing the fast-spreading disease. That's the case even for a country that was internationally hailed as a potential model for other developing countries in managing the coronavirus outbreak. The Vietnamese government's online newspaper VGP said on Monday that preliminary epidemiological investigations showed some of the new cases detected in Danang were linked to three hospitals in the city. Genome analysis also revealed that \"this is a new type of Covid-19, which is more infectious,\" said Acting Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long.\n\nAuthorities have tightened containment measures in Danang, such as stepping up contact tracing, limiting crowd sizes and halting non-essential services. Flights to and from the city have also been temporarily suspended. On Wednesday, Vietnam reported new cases in its two biggest cities \u2014 Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City \u2014 which were attributed to people who visited Danang in the last few weeks. Reuters, citing city authorities, reported that around 18,000 people who visited Danang returned to Ho Chi Minh City and another 21,000 went home to Hanoi. Authorities in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, said Thursday they will conduct mass testing of the 21,000 residents who recently returned from Danang, reported Reuters.

Anthony Kwan l Getty Images\n\nSeveral economists have downgraded their economic forecasts for Hong Kong as the semi-autonomous Chinese territory experiences a surge in coronavirus cases. The uptick in numbers forced authorities to impose stricter social-distancing measures this week. Hong Kong said Wednesday that advance estimates showed its economy shrank by 9% in the second quarter compared to a year ago. That's the city's fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year contraction, according to official data. The government said in a statement that the pandemic remains \"a key threat\" to the global economy and a renewed outbreak locally \"clouded the near-term outlook for domestic economic activity.\"\n\n\"Nonetheless, once the local epidemic is contained again and external environment continues to improve, the Hong Kong economy hopefully will gradually recover in the rest of the year,\" it added. Economists agreed that stricter social-distancing measures imposed after a recent flare up in cases will dampen any economic momentum. But some don't share the government's view that a recovery could come this year.\n\nImpact of stricter coronavirus measures\n\nEconomists at consultancy Capital Economics forecast an 8% contraction in the Hong Kong economy this year \u2014 close to doubling their previous projection of a 4.5% contraction. Capital Economics' latest downward revision is also worse than the government's official forecast for a 4% to 7% contraction in 2020. \"Until a few weeks ago, Hong Kong's economy looked set to start recovering this quarter,\" the economists said in a Wednesday note, pointing to the government's cash handouts of 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($1,290) that looked set to help lift economic activity after being disbursed earlier this month. But the stricter containment measures could \"postpone the recovery in consumption, and put additional pressure on employment and incomes, dampening the boost from the government cash handouts,\" they added. In addition to Capital Economics, Citi also downgraded its forecast for Hong Kong and predicted a full-year economic contraction of 6.3% compared to 5.5% previously.\n\nIris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at Dutch bank ING, expects the new social-distancing measures to stay in place for some time as the previous relaxation of restrictions might have contributed to the latest jump in cases. Pang said in a note on Wednesday that she's expecting the Hong Kong economy to shrink by 10% in the third quarter and 5% in the fourth quarter \u2014 bringing the full-year contraction to 8.3%. \"Covid-19 cases have increased in Hong Kong, and there could be many sources that are hard to trace,\" she said. \"The government has tightened further social distancing measures again since the outbreak, which the health department claimed could be due to the previous relaxation of social distancing measures.\" Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam warned this week that the renewed outbreak could overwhelm the city's health-care facilities and cost lives.

Democratic leadership has criticized the bill for leaving out key aid measures Democrats included in the $3 trillion relief package they passed in May.\n\nIn his call to reopen schools, Trump reiterated that the risk of Covid-19 patients becoming severely sick and dying from the disease falls with age. However, an underlying illness such as diabetes and obesity increases the risk of dying from Covid-19 in patients of all ages, including the very young, the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has warned. Children in the U.S. have previously been infected with Covid-19 and some have been hospitalized and even died.\n\n\"The lower they are in age, the lower the risk,\" Trump said Thursday at a news briefing in the White House. \"We have to remember that there's another side to this. Keeping them out of school and keeping work closed is causing death also. Economic harm, but it's causing death for different reasons, but death. Probably more death.\"\n\nThe president also indicated that if some state or local officials decide not to reopen schools, he thinks the school funding should be reallocated to parents.

Customers with at least 1,001 users that start annual subscriptions before Jan. 1, can get 55% off, for example.\n\n\"There's a lot of cost savings moving to cloud,\" said Farquhar. \"What we want to do is say, 'All those cost savings are in your pocket in the first year.\"\n\nAtlassian shares are up 43% this year, benefiting alongside other subscription software companies like Zoom and Slack, because its products have assumed greater importance with developers working remotely during the pandemic.", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/atlassian-team-earnings-q4-2020-plans-to-move-customers-to-cloud.html", "author": ["Jordan Novet"]}, {"title": "Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google all report earnings, and everything else you missed: CNBC After Hours", "text": "CNBC.com's MacKenzie Sigalos brings you the day's top business news headlines.

I think you saw in those answers what the actual problem for Congress [is] -- a lot of breaking companies up or heavily regulating them, they were talking a lot about competition, but also about consumer benefit. Under current antitrust doctrine, if you're providing a benefit to consumers, then it's very tough to argue for action to break you up, to change your business practice. That is the key thing. And notice that in that hearing, there's a lot of talk about competitors, and competitor complaints. Not very much talk about consumers.\"\n\nJason Ware, partner at Albion Financial Group, said new rules does not change the investment thesis for these tech companies.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is there were very few direct hits placed on these companies by members of the House committee. The big risk to owning any of these tech companies, these large tech companies, is outright breakup. I think higher regulation or bigger hurdles in regulation just means it's more difficult to compete against them if you're a small or midsized company. So I think new rules probably will be the result ultimately over the next several months or several years, but that doesn't really change the investment thesis for any of these companies.\"\n\nAneesh Chopra, former chief technology officer of the U.S., said Congress could revise its approach to consumer harm.\n\n\"In my opinion, there may be a broader policy move afoot in Washington to revisit some key assumptions about what it means for competition policy and if those assumptions change, it might have an effect for the industry as a whole and namely, this concept of a consumer harm standard for the basis of determining whether or not there's been a need for government intervention, and what you heard are individual case examples. I do think the conversation between Congressman Jayapal and [Amazon CEO Jeff] Bezos did surface new information to the public. That gives people a window into how these decisions are made, but they all are part of a broader fabric as to whether or not just because the price for the service is apparently free on the retail sense of the word, that there may be still harm and as a result, triggering the potential for intervention. And if that judgment changes then it has implications across tech as a whole.\"\n\nBrian White, analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt, said change will take time.\n\n\"I thought the hearing really shed light on some of the sins committed by Big Tech over the past decade. I think that was very clear. Ultimately, I think there's going to be a lot of changes and this is really about, you've got this massive platform, all four of these companies. ... There's a lot of different ways you can misuse your platform, not just about one particular area. And so, if laws are enacted and go into effect, it's in a lot of different areas and that will take time.\"\n\nBradley Gastwirth, chief technology strategist at Wedbush, is skeptical about real change to these companies.\n\n\"I really find it hard to believe that the U.S. government will be able to do anything to break these companies up. I find it hard to believe they'll have legislation down the road on this very fact. I mean, if you look at the size, how do you really restrict it? Do you restrict it by market cap? Do you restrict it by share? Restrict by revenue? ... At the end of the day, I think these companies have made some incredible innovation, and I would actually argue that things actually helped the consumer and lowered prices, rather than hurt the consumer.\"\n\nTristan Harris, former Google ethicist, said these companies act as modern-day infrastructure.\n\n\"I think what we saw [Wednesday] was a clear recognition that these platforms are the 21st Century infrastructure for the world.

Less is known about the organization's List of World Heritage in Danger. This list designates 53 World Heritage sites under threat of \"serious and specific dangers\" due to factors such as environmental change, structural degradation, armed conflict and neglect. In collaboration with insurance company Budget Direct, London-based creative agency NeoMam Studios worked with Serbian and Turkish architects to digitally reconstruct several UNESCO sites on this list. Using computer-generated renderings and animations, the sites are returned to a point in time that looks very different from what we see today.\n\nLeptis Magna in Libya\n\nLeptis Magna was added to UNESCO's list of endangered sites in 2016. Courtesy of Budget Direct\n\nForgotten for over 900 years, the ancient city of Leptis Magna was once considered to be one of the most beautiful cities in the Roman Empire. The Mediterranean city flourished under the reign of native-born Septimius Severus who, following the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, became the Roman emperor from 193 to 211. Like many Roman cities, Leptis Magna had a theater. This one, the oldest Roman theater in Africa, was dug into a low hill and included five flights of steps made from natural stone and concrete. It is believed that the structure was once decorated with hundreds of statues (133 have been identified), yet only two remain intact today. Located in what is now northern Libya, the site is primarily under threat due to environmental reasons such as flooding and plant overgrowth. Ongoing warfare and tourism (in this case, a lack thereof) exacerbate these problems.\n\nOld City of Jerusalem and its Walls\n\nThe Second Temple on the Temple Mount, as it may have looked following Herod the Great's refurbishment. Courtesy of Budget Direct\n\nThe Old City is a .35-square-mile walled area inside modern-day Jerusalem that contains some of the most important religious sites in the world, including the Temple Mount, the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Today, the portion shown here, the Temple Mount, is marked by the gold-roofed Dome of the Rock, which dates to 692 A.D. Before it, Solomon's Temple (the First Temple) and the Second Temple stood, until the latter was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. A remnant of the Second Temple complex exists today, a portion of a retaining wall \u2014 commonly known as the Western Wall or Wailing Wall \u2014 which is one of the most sacred sites in the world for Jewish people today. After being proposed by Jordan, the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls were added to UNESCO's \"in danger\" list in 1982, just one year after being named to the World Heritage List.\n\nPalmyra in Syria\n\nExperts believe that new technology will help reconstruct destroyed parts of Palymyra's Temple of Bel. Courtesy of Budget Direct\n\nOriginally a great caravan oasis for traders from Persia, China, India and the Roman Empire, the city of Palmyra made headlines in 2015 after it was captured by the Islamic State (IS) during the Syrian Civil War. The militant group destroyed ancient sites, conducted mass executions in a Roman-era theater and beheaded Syrian archaeologist Khaled al-Asaad, the head of antiquities of Palmyra, when he reportedly refused to reveal the location of the city's hidden antiquities. The Temple of Bel, shown here, did not survive the onslaught. In this digital rebuild, the \"before\" is what remained of the structure before IS demolished it. A lone archway (in the back) and a portion of a pillar is all that stands today.\n\nNan Madol in Micronesia\n\nThe partially-sunken city of Nan Madol, which thrived from 1200 to 1700, has been called the \"Venice of the Pacific.\" Courtesy of Budget Direct\n\nIt's been described as a destination cut straight from an Indiana Jones movie. Nan Madol is an abandoned city built atop a lagoon that contains over 90 man-made islands and a canal system. Carbon dating estimates construction began in the 12th century (about the same time as Cambodia's Angkor Wat), though little is known as to how the local Saudeleur population moved the heavy volcanic basalt rocks to create the stone palaces, temples and tombs of the lost water city. Local legend attributes it to magic, though scholars believe they were likely floated from the other side of the island. Not widely known and not necessarily easy to get to \u2014 you've got to fly to Pohnpei, Micronesia, drive an hour outside of the main town of Kolonia and then walk through a watery mangrove forest to reach it \u2014 the area saw an increase in tourism when it was named to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2016. Almost immediately, it was placed on the danger list due to coastal erosion, rising sea levels, silt accumulation in the canals and encroaching mangrove roots that are disturbing the ancient architecture.\n\nPortobelo-San Lorenzo fortifications in Panama\n\nPanama's Fort San Lorenzo is subject to environmental threats caused by humidity and soil erosion from the Chagres River.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a drop of 34.7%. Still, it was the worst drop ever, with the closest previously coming in mid-1921. The report \"just highlights how deep and dark the hole is that the economy cratered into in Q2,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"It's a very deep and dark hole and we're coming out of it, but it' going to take a long time to get out.\"\n\nThe report comes amid a recession that began in February and pulled first-quarter growth down 5%. On a quarterly basis, the Q2 decline was 1.8%. Sharp contractions in personal consumption, exports, inventories, investment and spending by state and local governments converged to bring down GDP, which is the combined tally of all goods and services produced during the period. Personal consumption, which historically has accounted for about two-thirds of all activity in the U.S., subtracted 25% from the Q2 total, with services accounting for nearly all that drop. Spending slid in health care and goods such as clothing and footwear. Inventory investment drops were led by motor vehicle dealers, while equipment spending and new family housing took hits when it came to investment. Prices for domestic purchases, a key inflation indicator, fell 1.5% for the period, compared with a 1.4% increase in the first quarter when GDP fell 5%, The personal consumption expenditures price index dropped 1.9% after rising a tepid 1.3% in Q1. Excluding food and energy, the \"core\" PCE prices were off 1.1%. However, personal income soared, thanks in large part to government transfer payments associated with the coronavorus pandemic. Current-dollar personal income rose more than six-fold to $1.39 trillion, while disposable personal income shot up 42.1% to $1.53 trillion. Despite the rise, personal outlays tumbled by $1.57 trillion, due in large part to a drop in services spending.

Social distancing and staying at home has become the new normal. This situation has wrecked world economies, and billions of dollars have already been wiped away as markets have tumbled uncertainty looms large.\n\nThe MSMEs are tossing on a tightrope; on the one hand, they have to ensure the safety of their employees, whereas, on the other, they cannot afford to falter in accounting and compliance. So here is the point where digital transformation becomes an essential part of the businesses to adopt and not an option anymore post lockdown. We all are witnessing the way technology is expanding at such an exponential rate. Especially during the time of lockdown, it has a big impact on the way we live our personal lives, and the effect on the ways we work has been even greater than before. It has changed how we manage many different aspects of business operations. The point is, Accounting is no exception.\n\nOpting a reliable accounting software as accounting is one of the most crucial and vital tasks you need to take care of when running a business of any scale. Especially for MSMEs, you cannot make too many errors while running your company. Hence, the need for accounting software is imperative in the overall success of your company. It is more beneficial to have accounting software to manage businesses and keep the records on track when half of the employee population is working from home and access to servers and software available at the office.\n\nSo it is very much important to know and understand why accounting software is important for businesses to post lockdown:\n\n1. GST filing on your tips\n\nThe accounting software can help in managing the complete GST of many small and medium businesses in a cost-effective and simpler manner. It can relieve the taxpayers from the format of manual data entry into the forms by auto-populating the fields. This would assist in filing error-free returns in a short span of time. A competent accounting system will allow you to validate your GSTIN Number, Automatically reconcile your GSTR 2A and track those transactions which are eligible for ITC by comparing or matching them with the ones on the purchase registers.\n\nThe new GST return has paved the way for e-invoicing in India, where the taxpayers will now have to upload invoices in real-time. In such situations, accounting software can assist you where it helps to create GST compliant e-invoices and immediately send them to the central system for validation. Since your accounting software will be connected with the government portal, it will allow you to recover invoices anytime to clarify the inconsistencies in your books.\n\n2. Easy Inventory Management\n\nInventory accounts for a substantial portion of all business expenses and has an immediate impact on profitability. It can be challenging for MSMEs dealing with large quantities of stored inventory, management of physical goods. In such a case, it's vital to develop a management system to support your business needs. Basically, inventory management consists of knowing what products are in your warehouse and where those products are located.\n\nHere, good accounting software offers enhanced accounting capabilities to balance books, prepare reports, and set sales reminders with the added benefit of real-time inventory tracking. It instantly accesses data and receives real-time communication between sales and warehousing departments, enhancing customer service. Also, it provides up-to-date information on current inventory levels, as well as tracking capabilities of the incoming and outgoing product.\n\n3. Saving Costs\n\nAccounting software automates administrative operations and core calculations as well as takes proper control of your revenue model, so you don\u2019t have to outsource your finances and its management to an external party. The software can also minimize the costs associated with printing and distributing documentation since all data is digitally stored in a secure and monitored location.\n\n4. Improves Financial Data Security\n\nFinancial data is the company\u2019s most confidential information and must be highly protected so that it does not fall into the wrong hands. An accounting system ensures your financial data remains safe by storing it in a centralized system that is protected by firewalls. Thus, only those who are granted access rights can see the data.\n\nConclusion\n\nPandemic like situations can hit a business without any warning and lead to a catastrophic upheaval in their future plans. Therefore, the need of the hour is to embrace and incubate accounting technology disruptions at the earliest and be future-ready at all times.

People with reasonable expectations can definitely achieve long-term returns.\n\nRisk Aversion For Regular Investors\n\nGenerally, the regular investors have wise decision-making and get better outcome. But at the same time, some people fall for inadequately governed companies in the ecosystem. Kamath said wealthy investors are allocating capital to good quality stocks in order to achieve diversification on their portfolio. However, the ones who are medalling with penny stocks or related stuff will move to better quality company in a course of time. In terms of capital allocation, residential real estate gets a chunk of ones savings. It yields only 2 per cent returns.\n\nBut, this trend is changing as young investors are entering the market and the notion of traditional investment has changed. Significant allocation in the equity market is coming from people in 25-30 years age group.\n\nTrue Beacon & Zerodha: The Differentiator Factor\n\nZerodha has scaled in an incredible manner by being the effective platform for investors. Organic growth has been the differentiator factor of Zerodha. Kamath recalled that the idea of starting True Beacon evolved when he reflected over allocation of money in one of the banks few years ago. After realizing the intricacies of the fund management associated to it, he decided to eliminate all these inefficiencies. This was followed by removing the middle men and defining client-aligned business model. True Beacon has performed in an exceptional manner by changing the approach of asset manager.\n\nEcosystem Resilience And Business Plans For 2021\n\nCOVID-19 has expedited prevalent trends in the industry and everybody will be online. Kamath remarked, \u201cEverybody will use technology and it leads to the need to evolve and remain agile.\u201d Zerodha and True Beacon aims to evolve faster than competitors. He shared that after trading for 15 years, it is apparent that future of the market cannot be predicted.

As a strategic response to the situation, the government of India announced several relief measures including a moratorium on EMI repayment until August 31, 2020. The move made it important for banks and non-banking financing companies (NBFCs) to realign their liquidity management and business expansion plans.\n\nAs the expiry of this moratorium comes closer, banks and NBFCs have a new challenge, i.e., the biggest loan recollection exercise in their history, in a time of economic slowdown. The exercise is also very important given the rising NPA levels at financial institutions. Here\u2019s how technology can be of great advantage on this journey.\n\nAnalytics\n\nData analytics capabilities help financial institutions trace down high risk accounts, and bucket them based on the account\u2019s risk profile. Few low-ticket size accounts may not have a favorable cost-to-benefit ratio to invest further resources in recovery, while, for certain high-ticket accounts even partial recovery could be worthwhile. Analytical models can factor in multiple metrics such as credit scores, relationship history, transaction history and psychometric profile, among others, to identify high priority accounts, so that the recovery teams can allocate their resources accordingly.\n\nDigitized Outreach\n\nWhile there is no denying the importance of on-ground collection teams to expedite the recovery, overdependence upon them could slow down the process besides being expensive. But during times like these, NBFCs would also not like to be seen as pushy and insensitive, last couple of months executives across levels and teams have reached out to borrowers, to give that personal touch, while ensuring their message is getting across .\n\nIn the longer term however, automated and digitized outreach, can bring an important positive change to collections operations for financial institutions. For example, they can subscribe to smart digital platforms that allow them to access the borrower\u2019s smartphone with due consent. This effectively converts the device into a virtual collateral. Once this is done, an innovative over-the-air communication protocol can help the lender reach the borrower even when he is offline, out of cellular coverage area or unwilling to answer the calls. This eliminates the need for sending SMSes or setting up a huge call center for outreach.\n\nDigital Payments Over Cash\n\nWith significant improvement in the digital payments infrastructure, repayment can easily be facilitated using several options including UPI, credit and debit cards, net-banking, digital wallets and so on. Lenders can educate borrowers about the ease of using these options and reduce the challenges of walking up to a branch to repay or take out cash from ATMs or bank branches.\n\nApart from deploying an efficient recovery mechanism, banks also need to sensitize borrowers how paying on time may benefit them and open up more financial services and larger loans in future. This goes a long way towards ensuring a sustained cash flow for them and building a healthy financial culture in the country, as we recover from the economic ripples of COVID-19.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354071", "author": ["Neel Juriasingani"]}, {"title": "Why India should start using online Tribute services", "text": "July 31, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nPosting an obituary when a loved one passes away is an inexpressible pain. Friends and relatives of the deceased come to extend their condolences when they learn of the person\u2019s demise. Families\u2019 emotional attachment and bond with their deceased relative prompts them to pay tribute to the departed.\n\nAs now we all are aware that in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19, the government has issued orders to limit the size of public gatherings. The government\u2019s rules extend even to funerals. As a result, fewer people are attending funerals. While limiting the size of gatherings at funerals is an excellent way to prevent coronavirus from spreading, it makes it impossible for everyone who wishes, to pay their respects to the departed. Many who would like to bereave with the family and friends of someone who has passed away can\u2019t do so because of the government\u2019s orders.\n\nIn such a scenario, people can create befitting tributes online. Posting obituaries, like much else, is being reshaped by technology and is now widely accepted in India. Online obituaries help all the family and friends grieve the passing of a loved one. Such obituaries are dynamic tributes to a deceased person. By collating messages, videos, and pictures of and for the deceased, online tribute services are ensuring the bereaved family, and friends and relatives of the deceased get their closure and solace, from any corner of the world, even if they have not been able to attend the funeral.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nOne can create a profile or a personalized tribute page on the websites of tribute services for their dear ones who are no more and give information about the 'chautha', 'baithak', and other rituals. Such platforms are well integrated with email, Whatsapp, and SMS. Due to the ongoing situation, the people in India should also tilt towards online tribute services as they reassure to say goodbye to a loved one and share the memories without the need to bring people together physically in one place.\n\nMemorials Allow Everyone to Participate\n\nAs these memorials are online, they allow you to connect with a huge number of people around the world. You can communicate it with friends and family around the country or even internationally what is occurring and what happened, thus allowing everyone to participate.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Not Just Information\n\nWhen grieving, many people need to do more than just say a loved one has passed on. We have seen that on social media platforms like Facebook or Whatsapp, people just react on obituary information by just writing RIP or Om Shanti which seems merely as a formality of paying tribute. The reason has been that such platforms are not the correct place to create obituaries or tributes. The need to share their thoughts and feelings about the deceased can only be done meticulously on a proper tribute page of the deceased. Also, the tributes paid by people have limited visibility on Facebook as people do not generally scroll back too long to read older posts. A tribute page provides you with the ability to do just that. It also allows your loved ones to share thoughts about the individual all in one place and can view even the oldest posts in a click.\n\nGlobal Reach\n\nOnline memorials allow people to participate in the grieving process from anywhere across the globe and at any time, whether it's day or night. If someone is not able to attend the last ceremonies of the deceased person, he/she can still participate in the grieving process with online tribute platforms. Such public displays of grief are essential for emotional recovery after bereavement.\n\nIt\u2019s There For The Long Term\n\nAn online obituary is online forever, which means future generations can learn about their forefathers. People who never knew their grandparents could visit online obituaries to learn about the extraordinary lives their ancestors lived. When an online obituary is created, it becomes a repository of people's lives for future generations, thus helping you to grieve more reassuringly.\n\nConclusion\n\nMarking the death of someone is important, and if you cannot bring people together in one place, with online tribute, you can still celebrate life and hold a fitting memorial. An online tribute platform comes as a solace for people who wish to pay their tributes on the demise of their loved ones from far away and preserve their memories for a lifetime in a beautiful manner.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354070", "author": ["Sumit Khaitan"]}, {"title": "How to Build a Successful E-commerce Business in the Congested Lifestyle Domain", "text": "July 30, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nAny business idea is only an idea till it doesn\u2019t have a USP and for an e-commerce brand, it is the most important to understand what is the USP and how well you can use it to develop a customer base. E-commerce can be a challenging space owing to the vast variety of options to choose from and having the capability to service a large crowd.\n\nOne needs to carefully define the market in their head and focus exclusively on it. Then you need to make sure to invest time in cultivating the brand and at the end be something you are proud of. This quality and pride in your brand would reflect your customers. The strategy to penetrate into e-commerce market is firstly to identify the target group and differentiate between the customers\u2019 needs and luxury. You need to study the market space and measure the potential consumption after the differentiation is made.\n\nThe e-commerce industry is no longer a strange territory for aspiring businessmen and space is getting cluttered, especially in the lifestyle domain. But if the basics are set right and the key details are factored in right from the beginning, you will be able to make a comfortable spot for your brand without having to worry about too much competition. The core strategy while getting into e-commerce should of course be customer satisfaction and to understand when and what the market demands. It\u2019s important to keep changing and going ahead with the trend which plays an integral part to make the customers a part of our story. Never forget that your customer is a normal person and like any other normal person, your customer\u2019s needs will also evolve over time and you should be ready to cater to it. Only identifying the target demographics is not enough unless you are buying media. The fundamental aspect is to focus on research that identifies and defines the profitable target group. This is a key focus as it helps with the target segmentation in combination with the behavioural data and it provides the actionable insights for growth.\n\nIt is essential to choose the e-commerce platform as to building a website from scratch because the main focus is to sell the products and increase sales. And being personally involved in the initial stage will steer your brand exactly into the direction you want it to grow. One needs to make sure their website is easy to navigate and has a very user-friendly interface. The usage of too many jargons and technical terms make it difficult for a normal customer to understand the nature of the offerings and they often leave your site before completing a purchase. The product images have to be of high quality and real. Presenting a false image will gather new customers initially but in the long run, it will result in loss of sale and affect your brand image in a negative way. The product catalog needs to always be updated so that people know what\u2019s new and relevant information should be provided to the customers. One of the biggest factors to be avoided is \u201cDON\u2019T MAKE RETURNS OR EXCHANGE TOO TOUGH FOR THE CUSTOMERS\u201d. The reason people choose an e-commerce platform of for ease of access and a comfortable buying at their fingertips, these two experiences can never be compromised. Customer care services for an online business play an important role because the consumer has zero face-to-face contact with the brand. The customers' interaction with customer service needs to be satisfactory and leave a lasting impression to build trust and faith in the brand or service. Creating customer loyalty is not only important for a higher rate of returning customers, but it also creates an unbeatable level of word-of-mouth advertising.\n\nDigital is flourishing in our country and it holds the capacity to stand tall even in testing times. Our current situation is the best proof of digital emerging as the winner. At a time when other businesses are striving to stay afloat, industries such as e-learning, online gaming, social media, e-delivery, and OTT platforms are multiplying their profits. People are confined to their homes and are becoming heavily dependent on online services for entertainment and to meet their daily requirements. Many offline businesses these days are opting to adapt an online business model. The value of money and the lesser cost of running the business is also making it an appealing industry for investors to pump in their money. The primary difference between an online and offline store is the location and reach. While Brick and Mortar give the customer the look, feel, and touch experience whereas it restricts the reach which is one of the biggest criteria for brand growth.

And one of those key indicators is your .\n\nFor entrepreneurs, it's not just about physical fitness. Your cognitive fitness matters equally.\n\nWhen you think of cognitive fitness, think of these ten categories: attention, motor control, memory, perception, language, social and emotional functioning, planning and logic, computational skills, creativity and imagination, and motivation.\n\nIf that seems overwhelming, don't fret. You can start building a brain that is healthier, smarter, and stronger through these five practical habits.\n\n1. Eat more Omega-3s\n\nWhat protein is to your muscles and what calcium is to your bones is what Omega-3s are to your brain.\n\nThe human brain is nearly 60 percent fat. And within that, there's a large portion that consists of an Omega-3 fatty acid called Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)\u2014talk about a mouthful of a word.\n\nRelated: Brain Hacks to Boost Motivation and Beat the Work From Home Blues\n\nDHA is relevant to your personal and entrepreneurial life due to it promoting new neuron growth, which allows signals to move across neurons. In plain speak: this allows your brain to operate much more efficiently and effectively.\n\nBesides exercise and sleep, your nutrition dictates the level to which your brain will perform.\n\nImproving your nutritional regimen through the inclusion of more Omega-3s will enhance your memory, your attention-to-detail, your mood and charisma, and your ability to assimilate and implement information.\n\nTo get started, start adding foods such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, and trout to your weekly menu. If the sound of those foods makes your stomach churn or turns your nose up, invest in a high-quality fish oil supplement.\n\n2. Play chess\n\nEntrepreneurship isn't just about landing pages, funnels, and tactics. Being able to recognize trends and adapt to the current market is equally, if not, more important.\n\nWhen it comes to recognizing trends and patterns, this can further break down into pattern and object recognition. The left hemisphere of your brain deals with object recognition, while the right deals with pattern recognition.\n\nRelated: Can Binaural Beats Make Your Brain Smarter?\n\nWith that said, in a 2010 study appearing in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, researchers discovered that playing chess boosted both sides of your brain.\n\nChess also helps your brain stimulate the growth of dendrites, which are tree-like branches that conduct signals from other neuron cells into the neuron they're attached too.\n\nWith bigger and faster neurons, your ability to process information, along with your general intelligence, will rise.\n\nAnd here's some more good news: you don't need to turn into the next Bobby Fischer to reap the benefits.

Learn a new language\n\nWhether it's to help with the ever-increasing diverse business world or to integrate more in-depth into a culture on your next travels, learning a new language is beneficial.\n\nOne of the more significant benefits of learning a second language is it helping to increase the volume of your brain. This may sound strange at first, but I promise, this should be music to your ears.\n\nNot only is it an evolutionary advantage, but it's also beneficial to strengthening your \"mental muscles.\"\n\nAppearing in the October 2012 issue of NeuroImage, scientists discovered that consistently practicing a language generates higher hippocampal volume, which happens to be the cerebral structure whose main task is linked to our memory.\n\nLastly, as an entrepreneur, a large portion of your day revolves around making decisions.\n\nAnd speaking of decisions, a study by the University of Chicago appearing in the April 2012 issue of Psychological Science found that people who spoke an additional language were better able to pick up nuances and subtleties in any given situation. Individuals made decisions that were more rational-based as opposed to emotionally-based.\n\nRelated: How to Strengthen Your Brain for Success\n\nWhile a tutor or immersing yourself in a country is great, starting with any language app for as little as 15 minutes is a great way to build this habit up.\n\n4. Commit to a writing practice\n\nWhen we think of mitigating stress, the first train of thought is to seek out Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Holy Basil, and Vitamin D, amongst many others.\n\nHowever, there's something you can do right this moment to mitigate stress: start writing.\n\nYou don't need to write the next great American novel nor become the next Tolstoy or Garcia-Marquez to reap the benefits of daily writing.\n\nWriting is great for improving your critical thinking skills. But most importantly, writing (specifically, journaling) is beneficial to an entrepreneur's mental health.\n\nWhether it's your health, relationships, past trauma, or merely the emotional roller coaster of building something from scratch while navigating through a pandemic\u2014journaling is beneficial for entrepreneurs.\n\nA study appearing in the September 2005 issue of the Advances in Psychiatric Treatment found that writing about emotional, stressful, or traumatic events for 15 to 20 minutes on multiple occasions was found to improve your physical and psychological health.\n\nNo need to get fancy, use a dedicated notebook to share your thoughts on for 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n5. Learn how to dance\n\nI remember the first time I walked into a salsa class. My stomach was in knots, and my palms were getting sweaty. Luckily, I found a towel to wipe my hands before asking a girl to dance.\n\nYears later, dancing has provided numerous benefits to my personal and professional life: two of those being self-confidence and the ability to think quicker on my feet. Being quick on your feet and able to improvise is essential throughout every stage of the selling process along with general daily communicating.\n\nHowever, as you age, the typical person sees a decrease in their motor, cognitive, and perceptual abilities.

The middle class is an unforgiving place to be for aspiring millionaires. As a society, we have been raised to believe that a $70,000 salary, a house in the suburbs, a couple of cars, and two-week vacation is living comfortably. Your parents are right; this kind of life is comfortable, it\u2019s normal. After all, it\u2019s what hundreds of millions of utterly average Americans are doing, and they\u2019re perfectly happy, right?\n\nHowever comfortable an average life may be, it\u2019s certainly not freedom.\n\nComfort is commonly mistaken for freedom. Where the majority of American\u2019s go wrong is taking money advice from those stuck in the middle-class, financial comfort zone, rather than those who have built wealth. Having been raised with a middle-class mindset towards money and lifestyle, I understand how difficult it is to break free of the restrictive thoughts that keep people from their potential. Because I\u2019ve done it, I also know, step-by-step, how to break out of average and become financially free.\n\n1. Embrace sales as a way of life\n\nSelling impacts every person on this planet. Someone\u2019s ability or inability to sell, persuade and negotiate directly influences their position or status in life. There is a person in this world selling every millisecond of every day.\n\nYou need to sell yourself to get the job you want, you need to convince your boss why you should get the raise you think you deserve, you need to persuade the car salesman to give you a discount, you need to sell your crush on saying yes to dinner, and the list goes on.\n\nThere is no limit to what and how much you can sell, and what you get in return is the commission. How good or bad you are at sales determines the life you lead. When you embrace sales as a lifestyle and begin to develop your skills in the area of sales, an immediate shift will take place. You\u2019ll begin getting more of what you want more often, setting yourself up for a future of freewill.\n\n2. Become an asset\n\nYou can\u2019t get to where you\u2019ve never been by doing the things you\u2019ve always done. If you want to reach higher levels in life, you\u2019ll need to think, train, and perform at higher levels. To enhance your thinking, invest in books with quality information from credible authors. To improve your training, you must invest in proven programs and workshops created by the people who have already built the wealth you want and are who you strive to become. To enhance your performance, invest in personal coaching from these people, allowing yourself a closer look into the mindset and actions of the ultra-successful, and adopting them into your daily practice.\n\nInvest in yourself first and become your greatest asset. If the economy crashes and your bank balances go to zero, all you\u2019ll have left is yourself. When self-development is done correctly and continuously, the only resource you\u2019ll need to prosper is you.\n\n3. Expand your network\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this a million times before: \u201cIt\u2019s not X, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d The people you know, and who know you, will have an effect on the quality of your life; even if that effect is no effect. Yes, your life is impacted when it\u2019s not being impacted. Make a list of ten people in your network, and ask yourself: Do they invest in your ideas? Can they introduce you to people who can? Are they more successful than you? Do they add to your life?\n\nRelated: How Millennials Can Reach Financial Freedom\n\nSomeone in your circle who is not adding to your life, but not necessarily subtracting, is still having an impact on the overall state of your life. Rather than investing your time and energy into people who can help you expand, it\u2019s being spent on people who play an inactive role in bettering your life and theirs. Discover who you want in your inner circle and devise a plan to meet them. When you have the right people in your corner, anything is possible.\n\n4. Save to invest\n\nIf you were raised middle-class like me, you were most likely taught to save money for a rainy day, keep funds tucked away for emergencies, or to put your money away to buy a house, car, or two-week vacation in Hawaii.\n\nThe problem with this is that once you spend the money, it\u2019s gone. The money that you saved to buy the house or car is worth less than it was the day after you spent it. The same way your house and car depreciates, your two-week vacation in Hawaii is an experience that will fade from memory over time. When it comes to savings, there is no light at the end of the tunnel; the tunnel just ends.\n\nRelated: 8 Ways to Set Yourself Up For Financial Freedom in Your 20s\n\nThe lessons I learned and applied from rich people to become rich myself was to save money to invest in appreciating, income-producing assets. Money should always come back to you. Rather than saving for the sake of saving, save your money to put it into smart investments that pay consistent returns for the rest of your life.\n\n5. Cash flow\n\nWhen you\u2019ve saved enough money to start investing, choosing where to put your money is the final step to your financially free future. Some put their money into the stock market, which in my opinion, is only a good option for two kinds of people: Those who have enough wealth to risk a lot of money, or those who have the time to constantly watch the market for fluctuations. Stocks are too volatile for my taste; too much chance, with very little monthly payout.\n\nGood money can only be made in the stock market when one has enough of three things: Knowledge (could be in the form of a fiduciary), money, and luck. Lose access to even one of these three things, and your chances of losing money increase dramatically.\n\nSome invest in houses to flip or rent out. Renting single-family homes can produce positive cash flow but having a single tenant to depend on for payment is risky. If something happens to your tenant or in your tenant's life that affects their living situation, your unit immediately becomes vacant, and you don\u2019t get paid unless you can quickly fill that vacancy. As long as the unit remains unoccupied, it depreciates.\n\nRelated: Gain Financial Freedom With Your Own Ad Agency\n\nI invest in multifamily apartment complexes. The reason I\u2019ve chosen to put my money into apartments since I was 30 is because of their consistency in producing strong cash flow, month-after-month. Even if there are a handful of vacancies or tenants who are late on their payments, monthly income is still being generated from the remaining tenants.\n\nThe consistent cash flow that multifamily assets produce increases the value of these properties over time, priming them to be sold for much more than they were purchased for, or producing substantial lifelong income and generational wealth.\n\nThere\u2019s enough wealth in the world for everyone, including you.

Apps like UberEats, Zomato, Swiggy, Grofers, BigBasket Dunzo and Amazon Prime have made it possible to get groceries shipped straight to your door, while many restaurants have beefed up delivery services during COVID-19.\n\nAs consumers continue to stock up on essentials as well as hoard and panic-buy grocers, delivery services, and e-commerce companies are adapting at a rapid pace to meet consumer demand and deal with the unchartered territory of how to keep employees and shoppers safe from the virus while doing so.\n\nAs consumers deal with the unexpected fallout of crisis situations like COVID-19, grocers can take on the role of the responsible retailer, working with partners and local governments to provide for hard-hit consumers while building trust within local communities.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to run its course, grocers must also focus on optimizing processes and serving customers now, while planning ahead. While harder to predict, grocers should be prepared to navigate shifts in demand, supplier partnerships, and inventory management as panic buying slows down and consumers begin to return to more regular shopping patterns. \u201cGreed has done its round. Now the fear is driving opportunities for new entrants to think whether I should take from a nearby retailer versus a delivery boy coming from an unknown place,\u201d says Anand Kumar Bajaj, MD and CEO of PayNearby.\n\n\u201cCollaboration is the way forward. We are fighting for a new world order which is driven by technology. We all should join hands to solve problems for retailers or insufficiencies in trade. It can only happen if the collective consensus says yes that we need to solve the problem together. It will create a surplus because India is at an inflection point in the gross domestic product (GDP) when we cross 3000 per capita GDP dollars, the nation\u2019s consumption will start becoming less price conscious in grocery,\u201d mentions Venkateswaran.\n\nWill this crisis have long-term impact on the way people shop, or how grocers do business? The steps grocers take to optimize the supply chain have the potential to reshape how grocers interact and build relationships with customers, employees and partners now, and for years to come.\n\nSeamless customer experiences have been a priority even before the pandemic, and grocers are responding by tailoring their online platforms to meet consumers\u2019 shifting needs. They are reexamining how they list their products online, seeking to support growing digital payment volumes and approaching their in-store operations with the same critical eye. Some are even exploring how flexible delivery hours or automation could support speedier transactions. Grocers and their payment providers must not get complacent, however. They will need to be prepared to craft new innovations and implement technologies for a future in which consumers expect more flexibility in how they shop and pay. \u201cGrocery market is like a Russian winter, you have to respect it,\u201d adds Venkateswaran in light humor.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/video/354007", "author": ["Prabhjeet Bhatla"]}, {"title": "5 Key Trends in Innovation and How Leaders Can Capitalize On Them in 2021", "text": "July 30, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nInnovation is a given in today\u2019s market, but not all types of innovation are created equally. Over the past couples of decades, to innovate has been to adopt new forms of tech, become more productive and expand your reach further than it\u2019s ever been before. While these are all still key parts of business, forward-thinking entrepreneurs are starting to look in new directions as well.\n\nAccording to estimates from McKinsey & Company, the minimum economic value that has been vaporized by the pandemic is somewhere in the range of $9 trillion. With a figure like that, it\u2019s no wonder that business leaders the world over are looking to change the ways they think about innovation for good.\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping to ride the next transformational bandwagon, you\u2019ll need to know what the current discourse around innovation looks like. Here are a few good places to start.\n\n1. Consumer Interaction\n\nThe customer may always be right, but companies sure haven\u2019t been treating her like she is. COVID-19 has exposed just how flimsy some businesses' customer experiences truly are, and consumers are ready to fight back. Research from American Express has shown that one-third of customers will switch brands after just a single bad experience, meaning that it\u2019s high time businesses get their act together.\n\nThe first place to start is by simply devoting more attention and resources to the demands of your client. Jeff Wong, one of the most innovative people I follow and EY\u2019s Global chief innovation officer, encourages leaders to go from \u201c'eyes down' (when they just focus on what\u2019s in front of them) to 'eyes up' and look ahead to assess what needs to be done to meet changing demands.\u201d An \u201ceyes up\u201d attitude can be all it takes to bring your company one step closer to the people it services and boost business in the process.\n\nRelated: Why You Should Speed Up Digital Transformation During the Crisis\n\nNow more than ever, people want the opportunity to make a difference with their purchases. Nearly 90 percent of customers want businesses to be more environmentally and ethically friendly, and those customers are more than willing to turn that desire into cash.\n\nEmbracing sustainability will look markedly different for every company, but it always generates consumer hype when done correctly. Consider Burger King\u2019s adoption of the Impossible Whopper or feeding their cattle lemongrass in order to reduce methane emissions. Neither of these are huge steps for a business to take, but they\u2019re tangible and expand the company\u2019s pool of customers to include those concerned about their carbon footprint.\n\n3. A Focus on EQ\n\nWhen we think of business innovation, it can be easy to get caught up in the notion of a driven, monomaniacal entrepreneur with something to prove. While that may be true in some instances, it\u2019s an outdated picture of an increasingly diverse field that is starting to value EQ as much as it does IQ.\n\nInnovation doesn\u2019t just mean creating a slick new product; it can just as easily mean novel corporate restructuring, implementation of new workplace policies or refining recruitment tactics. Startup consultant Andrew Deen said it best when he wrote that high-EQ entrepreneurs are \u201cgood at putting themselves in someone else\u2019s shoes and seeing challenges from different perspectives \u2026 these qualities typically make them excellent, respected communicators.\u201d\n\nConsumers are tired of companies proclaiming social responsibility but failing to put their money where their mouth is. After hundreds of companies posted black squares on June 2 in solidarity with nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, backlash soon followed, claiming that this amounted to little more than performative activism. Businesses willing to go the extra mile soon separated from the rest of the pack, with firms like Apple pledging $100 million to racial equity initiviates. Whatever is coming next in business, it\u2019s going to have to make a real change if it wants to survive.\n\nRelated: Collaboration Is the New Innovation\n\n5. Virtual Living\n\nEven before the pandemic struck, the average internet user spent just shy of 7 hours a day online \u2014 an already-high number that has surely ballooned since the start of the pandemic. The digital world may be full of ways to keep yourself entertained, but as the internet starts to become a prosthetic for other aspects of life, people are starting to look for new ways to replicate in-person experiences online.\n\nWave, a digital concert-streaming platform, recently nabbed $30 million during a round of fundraising and later partnered with Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation label, paving the way for a new era of concerts that don\u2019t have to be attended to be seen. Rock-star manager Scooter Braun perhaps summed it up best when he said that \u201cthe future of the industry depends on\u201d companies like Wave, and the same is true for nearly all other industries as well.\n\nThe business world is changing before your very eyes; you just need to latch on to the right changes at the right time. Innovation is a story that\u2019s never finished, but getting involved now can ensure happy endings for your later on.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353889", "author": ["Rashan Dixon"]}, {"title": "Side Hustles for These Times", "text": "July 30, 2020 1 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nPeter Voogd describes several ideas for entrepreneurs looking to make extra money and improve their skillset.

The problem is, company accountability is hard to track and is often a catalyst for investments gone bad. A study by Harvard found that angel investors reported that only 11 percent of their portfolio yielded a positive return. This means nine out of 10 angel investments typically end poorly, with investors not having any control over the day-to-day operations of what a company does and how it spends its money.\n\nThankfully, a new crowdfunding model has emerged and just experienced its first successful launch. Dynamic Coin Offerings (DYCOs) leverage blockchain technology to add accountability to teams by holding raised funds in third-party management and offering up to 80 percent refunds to early contributors if the price of a company\u2019s token drops below the initial participation price.\n\nThe first DYCO was managed by a Prague-based company called DAO Maker that managed the crowdfunding campaign, KYC, audits and other regulatory and legal aspects. The first DYCO, Orion Protocol, saw massive interest on the platform, oversubscribing 300 percent in its private contribution round and even more in its public round.\n\nRelated: 50 Things You Need to Succeed in the Perpetually Changing World of Modern Finance\n\nInitial feedback from the startup community was overwhelmingly positive, with praise for its transparency and commitment to mutual success. To get a better feel of the model and potential drawbacks, here are three key aspects of DYCOs.\n\n1. DYCOs offer multiple levels of safeguards\n\nThe DYCO model allows participants to send in 100 percent of their tokens for up to 80 percent refunds, no matter if they previously sold tokens in the past or not. This process starts at the ninth month following the crowd sale and is tranched through the 16th month.\n\nThis creates a system of accountability where teams need to perform or they risk losing back most of the funds they crowdfunded. As explained by on DAO Maker's website, \"With a DYCO, 100 percent of the circulating supply is backed by USDC (a stable equivalent for the U.S. dollar) for the first 16 months after the crowd sale. The token supply remains static during this time\" and is governed by a third-party to ensure there is no misappropriation of funds.\n\nIt is important to note that refunds can only be requested and granted if the token value falls more than 20 percent of the initial price. The additional upside is an arbitrage opportunity where contributors could re-purchase tokens below the 20 percent mark and redeem them for a profit. Ideally, a company would want to simply keep the value higher than this point for a win-win.\n\n2. DYCOs remove inflationary risks\n\nIn the case of a claimed refund, companies must burn, or eliminate, the tokens from their supply. This creates a positive impact on the company\u2019s community, as fewer tokens are in circulation despite the refund being processed, as well as a deflationary mechanism that will help retain token value by creating a price floor.\n\nIn past crowdfunded token sales, there was usually a race to the bottom where contributors from multiple rounds race to dump tokens as fast as possible. This was even a problem with projects that enforced some level of lockups. DYCO projects should be selective with their contributors to ensure there is a mutual vision and sense of responsibility. The positive aspect is that the various safeguards prevent most of the common issues seen in previous sales.\n\n3. Founding teams can\u2019t cash out before milestones are hit\n\nTeams, seed contributors, advisors and other internal staff are subject to a holding period of at least 16 months within a DYCO structure. Starting in the 16th month, these tokens will be tranched gradually over the following months to ensure teams remain accountable. If a team member leaves a company, they would still be subject to these lockups. The lockups are enforced by the host platform \u2014 in this case, DAO Maker.\n\nIt is important to note that DYCOs are not for everyone. They should be utilized by companies that are ready to build and commit to a long-term vision that includes very close interaction with various communities and supporters. This is not a cash-grab scenario like many token sales of the past as a significant portion of funds must be reserved for potential refund requests.\n\nRelated: How Blockchain Is Revolutionizing Business-Communication Networks\n\nPotential Risks With DYCOs\n\nAs with any crowdfunding campaign or token sale, participation is usually restricted to certain countries and jurisdictions. Potential participants should ensure that this is not a conflict and also be ready to submit KYC information upon request. This is a professional process that will require information from each contributor. Also, DYCOs should be seen as a long-term opportunity, not something that happens quickly.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is informational and should not be used as investment advice.

A quick Google search of \u201chow to be motivated\u201d brings up over 200 million results, in addition to scores of subtopics like \u201chow to stay motivated\u201d and \u201chow to motivate yourself.\u201d\n\nSo why don\u2019t I use ? Let me share a story to illustrate.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a keynote speaker at a conference for a network marketing company. After my presentation, one of the top leaders of the company came up to me and said: \u201cNoah, I took six pages of notes while I was listening to you speak. That was one of the best presentations I've ever heard.\u201d\n\nI thanked her, then she said something that I\u2019ll never forget. She said, \u201cBut there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d\n\nUh oh, I thought. Here it comes.\n\nShe said, \u201cIn our program, it says you\u2019re a motivational speaker. But you're not a motivational speaker.\"\n\n\"Really,\" I said. \"What am I?\"\n\nShe said, \"You're not a motivational speaker. You're a motivating speaker.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWow, that's very interesting. What's the difference?\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cWell, a motivational speaker is someone who gets you all pumped up, tells a bunch of stories and gets you all excited. Then you go into the office on Monday, and all of that \u2018motivation\u2019 has evaporated. And you\u2019re like, \u2018What am I supposed to do now?\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cBut you showed us exactly what to do and how to do it. You gave a step-by-step blueprint of exactly how I can reach my goals faster. That\u2019s why you motivated me.\u201d\n\nWhat is motivation?\n\nThe word motivation comes from the Latin word movere, which means \u201cto move.\u201d The word motivation has the same root as the word motor. That origination helps me to remember that motivation in human beings is like the motor in your car \u2014 it\u2019s the thing that causes both of them to move.\n\nTherefore, when you\u2019re thinking about your own motivation, it\u2019s helpful to consider what actually makes you move, as well as what makes you not move. For example, most and business leaders assume that the No. 1 thing that motivates people is money. Of course, everyone wants more money, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that.\n\nHowever, where many entrepreneurs and leaders go astray is assuming that money is the motivator for all of their employees. Interestingly, when I interview entrepreneurs and thought leaders, I often ask them what their motivation for starting their business was. Their answers vary from \"I wanted to make a difference,\" to \"I wanted to help people,\" to \"I wanted to make the world a better place.\" I can't remember one of the 200 entrepreneurs I've interviewed who answered \"I wanted to make a lot of money.\"\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nOf course you know that one of the tenets of goal-setting is to, um, set your goals. That is, to know what you want. I call this process identifying your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\n\nAsk yourself questions like:\n\nWhat do I want in my business?\n\nWhat do I want in my relationships?\n\nWhat do I want in my family life?\n\nWhat do I want to do with my time?\n\nJust like driving in your car, it\u2019s crucial that you know where you want to go. You wouldn\u2019t just jump in your car and drive around in circles, would you? Yet that\u2019s what millions of people are unconsciously doing in their lives.\n\nWhy do you want that?\n\nAfter you\u2019ve identified your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the next step is to ask these key questions that most people forget: Why?\n\nWhy do you want that goal you set in your business?\n\nIn your relationships?\n\nIn your family life?\n\nWith your free time?\n\nThere are only a few reasons why we humans take action, and most (if not all) of them come down to emotions or feelings. So when people tell me their goals, I always ask them, \u201cWhy do you want that?\u201d\n\nFocus on what you actually want\n\nOf course, we all want more time, more money,and more influence. That's all well and good, but why do you want those things? When I ask them this question, my coaching clients will answer:\n\nI want to feel important.\n\nI want to be heard.\n\nI want to be seen.\n\nI want to feel special.\n\nI want to be appreciated.\n\nIn fact, many of the entrepreneurs, executives and athletes I\u2019ve coached over the last two decades discovered that they had been going after external things without realizing the internal reasons that were actually driving them to go after them in the first place.\n\nThe truth is, there's nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with motivation. In fact, motivation is the motor that will keep you moving toward your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. However, understanding not just what you want (your outer motivation), but why you want it (your inner motivation), means that you can move beyond motivation and finally give yourself permission to succeed.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353724", "author": ["Noah St. John"]}, {"title": "The Ultimate 3-Step Formula for Business Success", "text": "July 27, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThinking of starting a business? Theoretically, it isn\u2019t all that difficult. The real trick is in making your business a successful one.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 50 percent of businesses don\u2019t make it to the five-year mark. Additionally, an estimated 90 percent of new startups fail. But why is that? The internet is chock full of checklists that promise to pave the way to success, but are they any good? Sure they are, but only to an extent.\n\nWhile these checklists do an excellent job detailing what novice entrepreneurs need to know, they don\u2019t necessarily provide any real guidance on what actually makes businesses successful. They don\u2019t dive into the psychological hacks and meaningful acts that win hearts and make a lasting impact. They are simply task lists, which we all know are ultimately dry.\n\nSo, what should really be done to increase chances of entrepreneurial success? I decided it would be best to ask an actual powerhouse, so I recently chatted with Misti Cain, the founder of Whyzze and the host of Mailchimp\u2019s newest business reality show, Werrrk! She believes entrepreneurs should ignore 90 percent of the advice offered on how to build a business empire. Instead, she suggests focusing on this three-step formula.\n\nRelated: 10 Women Entrepreneurs Who Are Shattering the Glass Ceiling\n\nStep 1: Show PROOFF\n\n\u201cPROOFF is an acronym,\u201d explains Cain. \u201cIt stands for Positive Real Outcomes Obtained From Figuring (it out). In other words, you need to be able to show the value you provide.\u201d She goes on to explain this can be an essential value, like saving your customers time, money or providing them with peace of mind. Or, it can be a non-essential value like making them look more popular, more intelligent or more successful to others. The point is, the better you can articulate how your product or service takes people from a starting pain point of \"A\" to a desirable end state of \"B,\" the more successful you will be.\n\nCain finds that many entrepreneurs use jargon, wit or flowery language that confuses more than it helps. As an example, she says messaging like, \"We help high-achievers become the best versions of themselves by empowering them to reach their full potential\" is difficult to understand. However, \"We help director-level professionals become C-Suite executives in under two years\" is clear and measurable. You now have a specific value success metric for your business. Once you help your customers achieve this metric, you can use it as PROOFF to attract others.\n\nStep 2: Satisfy a Sizeable Market\n\nAlso known as product-market fit, Cain says the second step of creating lasting business success is making sure what you do satisfies a strong market demand. The higher the number of people who want your product, the better. However, it\u2019s not just about quantity. The stronger their desire for what you\u2019re offering is also key.\n\nCain provides this litmus test to tell if you have product-market fit: Does your business have positive word-of-mouth traction? Are people eager to buy? Would they feel negatively if your product didn\u2019t exist or was taken away? Have your customers tried to solve this issue themselves unsuccessfully and does your product effectively solve it for them? The more yes answers you give, the higher the likelihood you have product-market fit.\n\nStep 3: Live By the Zig Ziglar Principle\n\nRenowned salesman and motivational speaker Zig Ziglar was quoted as saying, \u201cYou can have everything in life you want if you\u2019ll just help other people get what they want.\u201d Likewise, Cain strongly believes in the #givefirst model.\n\n\u201cWhen you make it a point to create a business that is value-driven, people happily pay you, refer you and support you,\u201d she says. \u201cThe pay-it-forward mentality makes steps one and two that much easier as well.\u201d\n\nRelated: A VC's Advice for Raising Capital Post-Covid\n\nAccording to Cain, you should build your business and make business decisions based on a foundation of helping others get what they want. As she advises, \u201cYou may have to make minor or even major adjustments along the way, but you will make substantial progress.\"\n\nThere\u2019s clearly a lot of oomph packed in each of Cain\u2019s three steps, and it\u2019s all easier said than done, but if implemented correctly, the fruits of these efforts might prove a bountiful tool as you build your business toward success.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349342", "author": ["Jennifer Spencer"]}, {"title": "How to Get Free Ad Spend on TikTok", "text": "July 27, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into the politics of TikTok operating as a foreign company on U.S. soil. Millions of Americans, and billions around the globe, are using it\u2019s platform, and if you are an entrepreneur, you should know how to use TikTok or have someone on your team that can manage it for you. The ad platform is not very different from Facebook\u2019s, with a few twists. I\u2019ll share what signing up was like for me and how you can get up to $2,300 in free ad spend with TikTok until the end of 2020.\n\nI know what you are thinking. You are thinking exactly what I thought: \u201cI just got a handle on Facebook, Instagram or Google PPC advertising, and now you want me to learn something else? I don\u2019t have the time to do this.\u201d\n\nWhat choice do you have though? You either market your product or service \u2014 hereafter referred to as widget(s) \u2014 where the most eyeballs go, or you shut down. Most entrepreneurs do not have a widget that is so unique or substantially better than everyone else\u2019s that you\u2019d be able to survive on word of mouth alone. Having a great product is important, but the sad reality is that there are a lot of great widgets that never get off the ground due to lack of exposure.\n\nRelated: 3 Reasons TikTok Is Here to Stay\n\nYou can\u2019t afford to wait, hope and pray that your product or service goes viral, but you can strategically place it in front of the right audience. That\u2019s what Facebook and Google have mastered, and it's the reason they are the titans of online advertising. Early adopters of each platform benefited by being first. These benefits included little competition and unbelievably low customer-acquisition costs. That is until, as Gary Vee puts it, \"Marketers ruin everything.\" Once everyone got on those platforms, the rates increased and the advertising rules had to be modified to comply with federal laws to keep scam artists from ripping off the consumer. Advertising online with Google or Facebook should absolutely be part of your online strategy, but you have to play by their rules.\n\nHistory is repeating itself, and you have the opportunity to be an early advertiser on TikTok just like the entrepreneurs and marketers of yesteryear who paved the way on Facebook and Google. This time, though, it\u2019s different. Because of your prior experience with advertising on those two platforms, many of you need less convincing than before. This means that there are more of you who are going to jump in earlier and faster.\n\nAbout a month ago, I saw an ad on Facebook to register as an advertiser with TikTok. Go figure. TikTok advertising on Facebook, so you can advertise on TikTok. Inception much?\n\nOn June 29, I received an email that the Ads Manager was available for me to use. That email sat in my spam box. I missed out on a seven-day window to be ahead of the pack.\n\nOn July 8, I got an email that the platform became available for all U.S. advertisers. I logged in and began the registration process.\n\nIn hindsight, I didn't register the Ads Manager with the same email address that I used to set up my personal TikTok account. I say that because as of right now, my TikTok Ads Manager and my personal account are not connected. What this means is that if anyone engages with my ad, the likes, comments and views are not being credited to my personal account page. I\u2019m sure in the future they will find a way, a la Facebook, to connect the business pages with the advertiser account. But as of right now they are separate. In fact, I don\u2019t get any email alerts about comments or interaction other than the cost per click (CPC) data. Again, I\u2019m sure this will change in the future.\n\nOnce I completed the registration process, I was prompted to submit my business-verification paperwork. I submitted DBA paperwork and corporate paperwork from the Secretary of State. Make sure there is consistency in your documentation. I realize that the structure of some businesses involves multiple levels of ownership, but the more complicated the hierarchy, the more likely you will be required to submit additional paperwork. Keep it simple. If you want to start as a sole proprietorship to make it easy, go right ahead, but you might need to upload a business license from your city or town.\n\nWithin hours, I received an email that said, \u201cUnfortunately we were unable to successfully verify your business. Until your business is successfully verified, you cannot enroll in the TikTok Back to Business Program.\u201d\n\nTikTok\u2019s \u201cBack to Business Program\u201d offers small- and medium-sized businesses up to $2,300 in free advertising assistance. Once approved, you receive a one-time free ad credit of $300 that has to be used by December 31, 2020. Plus, TikTok will match dollar-for-dollar what you spend in advertising up to $2,000 Not a bad deal. I uploaded additional documentation and waited.\n\nOne day later, on July 9, I was notified that my account had been verified and that I could begin advertising. Here is where it\u2019s a little different from advertising on Facebook or Google: TikTok requires that you pre-pay before you can advertise. This may be for the dollar-for-dollar matching program. Once you\u2019ve credited your account, it will reflect bonus credit you receive as part of their promotion. It works. I\u2019ve done it, and it\u2019s almost instant.\n\nCreating the ad is very similar to Facebook\u2019s three step process:\n\nCampaign. Ad group. Ad.\n\nThe targeting process is not as detailed as Facebook\u2019s, nor does it require you to categorize your audience as special groups. I used the same video for my ad that Facebook rejected, only to have it approved by TikTok. This is of course because TikTok hasn\u2019t been taken to court yet on account of, you guessed it, marketers screwing it up.

TikTok does also offer a website pixel along you to track conversions and ultimately retargeting.

However, most entrepreneurs are not aware of a small change they can make while and using stories. The secret is simple: Tell it in the present tense, even if it happened 20 years ago. And perhaps the best way to help you feel the power of the present tense is to demonstrate it.\n\nI had a memorable encounter on December 2012 In Palo Alto, California. Imagine now the picture I saw at the heart of Silicon Valley. She\u2019s a musician, and the way she holds her violin is magical. The way she plays reminds me of Pearlman. But there she stands in front of a famous coffee shop on University Street. Her music soothes the hearts and minds of those who walk around her.\n\nA simple hat is laid upside down next to her feet with several dollar bills in it. I approached her and said: \u201cFelix Mendelssohn, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my favorite concert,\u201d she said and stopped playing.\n\n\u201cWhy do you stand and play here, of all places?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThe people here have a lot of money,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDo you want a tip that is worth much more than a couple of bucks?\" I asked, smiling. \"Just like in music, sometimes a small change can make a big difference.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to,\" she said politely.\n\n\u201cYou should move to the sidewalk on the other side of the street and play there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cOver there is the Apple Store,\" I explained. \"People who go there undergo an experience. You\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after that, she played close to the Apple Store entrance, and her hat was filled with many bills. She saw me watching her again, smiling.\n\nRelated: How to Use Storytelling to Sell Your Brand and Vision\n\nAs an entrepreneur, If you want to succeed, help other people find their success. Sometimes a small adjustment they make due to your advice can lead them to a substantial, positive change. And the next time you tell a story, consider telling it in the present tense.\n\nToday, when most of your communication is virtual with Zoom, Teams, Webex et al, it\u2019s even more critical, because it helps you effectively engage your audience.\n\nAn experiment done by researchers at Princeton University showed neural coupling between storyteller and listener, and when you present it in the present tense, you get the best effect and impact.\n\nYou don\u2019t want them to wander off, multitask and pay attention to other things while delivering your message. If you want them to be fully present, tell your stories using the present tense.\n\nThat brings me to another advantage of telling your stories in the present tense: You often animate, act, play and better use your non-verbal communication while speaking in the present tense. Now, it\u2019s not only storytelling; it\u2019s like \u201cstory playing. A small change makes a big impact.\n\nRelated: Why the Best Storytellers Achieve the Most Brand Awareness\n\nNow, what\u2019s the main reason you want to use stories?

You can be a mom and pursue your dreams simultaneously\u2019\n\nWhen a woman chooses to run a business, she is well aware of the \u2018tight-rope walk\u2019 she has ahead. Add to it Motherhood, and the challenges staring her in the face, catapult to another level. Every task she undertakes begins with a deep sense of being impossible. But she keeps going, and sort of achieves the possible. Because she knows, that neither her child nor her work can ever be put at stake!\n\nEvery \u2018mompreneur', realises that it is much more than just a career. It is a mindset, a lifestyle shift that demands extraordinary management skills. She pushes the envelope hard, to be both - a mom and a boss.\n\nFor a \u2018mompreneur\u2019 to create a sustainable work-life balance, and be the best possible version of herself in the two vital roles of a caregiver and a business leader, she realises that the core tenets of both jobs are the same. In fact, they are so similar, that lessons drawn from one can easily be applied to the other, creating a win-win situation for both the \u2018avatars\u2019 she has donned.\n\nTime Management \u2013By befriending discipline, every \u2018mompreneur\u2019 is in control of time, and not the other way round. Having a To-Do list and a plan always helps. Allocating fixed hours for the housework, childcare, workouts, family time and work schedules, go a long way in managing time well. She schedules her meetings by prioritizing them. A working mom deserves some \u2018alone time\u2019 to strategize and brainstorm. By planning her tomorrow, today, she packs in much more. Outsourcing \u2013 A working mom doesn\u2019t have to be a \u2018Superwoman\u2019. Just by hiring the right people to handle tasks such as cooking, grocery shopping, and cleaning, gives her some respite. Finding an efficient nanny or a day-care to look over her child, gets her the much-needed peace of mind. At the workplace, the woman stops thinking of herself as the \u2018know-all\u2019. She trusts her colleagues, allocates jobs they can handle and makes them feel responsible. Respecting deadlines: Both, as an entrepreneur as well as a mom, the lady is bound to face deadlines. By prioritizing her day\u2019s activities, she works better around deadlines. It could be a presentation for the client or a project that her child needs help with. She has realised that the best way to go about it, is to start immediately, and if possible, finish before time. She knows that procrastination can put her in a spot if something unavoidable crops up. Team Management: A reliable team is an asset. A home eco-system with the right kind of help, from family and staff, contributes in myriad ways. Similarly, an efficient team at the workplace helps take a load off the working mom. A team that understands her and her expectations and ethics, is a dream team. So, building the right team, both, at work and at home helps her hugely. By adopting empathy and trust as her compass monitors while building a team, she seldom goes wrong. Persistence & Patience: A \u2018Mompreneur\u2019 never under-estimates these two attributes that contribute hugely in her dual role as mom and entrepreneur. Be it with her kid or her employee, or even a client, these two virtues help her stay calm and make the right decisions. Art of Negotiation: A skill that a parent often uses with the kids demanding that pizza or time out with friends, is no different from bargaining with the vendors or clients. Emotions, luck, or a weak mind have no place at the negotiating table. By knowing her limits and how far she is willing to go on all aspects of the deal, the \u2018mompreneur\u2019 fast-tracks the negotiation process. Connection: For any business to succeed, the \u2018connection\u2019 it makes with its potential customers is crucial. The vital question being, \u2018Is the offering fulfilling a need?\u2019 This trait of \u2018Connection\u2019 comes naturally to a mom. Her innate connection with her child helps the \u2018mompreneur\u2019 in connecting easily with the needs of her client, and therefore in customizing offerings that resonate with the client.\n\nWhen a woman becomes a mother, there is a tendency for her to get \u2018identified\u2019 with motherhood. But a \u2018mompreneur\u2019 knows exactly how and when to distinctly be either. Studies have shown that kids of working moms turn out to be independent, have a strong sense of self-worth, and take on responsibilities early in life. This validates the fact that a \u2018mompreneur\u2019 enriches both the aspects of her life. In the long run, not only does she have children to be proud of, but also a successful business.\n\nYes, being a \u2018Mompreneur\u2019 is worth every little effort!", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353823", "author": ["Tejal Daftary Mehta"]}, {"title": "Digit is Busting Complexity in Insurance With Technology", "text": "July 30, 2020 4 min read\n\nHaving worked in the insurance industry for 30 years, Kamesh Goyal exactly knows the challenges facing it\u2014confusion created by jargon-heavy terms and conditions and the resulant mistrust of the industry.\n\n\u201cInsurance is supposed to be a trust-based system where one is assured help during difficult times,\u201d says the Chairman, Goyal. \u201cIn a country like India where insurance penetration is low, I understood where exactly the challenge and opportunity lay.\u201d\n\nDigit Insurance, one of the first fully cloud-based insurance firms in India, came about in 2016 with Goyal wanting to \u2018make insurance simple\u2019 through technology. The core idea was to simplify the customer\u2019s journey and provide them with a seamless experience, right from picking products, to policy issuance to claim processes, as per Goyal.\n\nThe full-stack insurtech startup powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), image analytics, tracking technologies and data lakes, builds general insurance products, such as motor, health, travel and home insurance, among others.\n\nThe two-year old company has served 6.9 million customers till date, underwritten premiums worth INR 2,200 crore and processed over 2 lakh claims. It claims to have gained 1.2 per cent market share of the overall Indian Insurance sector within two years of operations.\n\nGoyal also counts its Net Promoter Score (NPS)\u2014a service quality metric\u2014of over 80 an achievement for the company. The highest NPS score among the major private sector insurers is 70.3 (of ICICI Lombard GIC) in motor insurance category, 62.1 (of Bajaj Allianz) in life insurance and 76.7 (of Apollo Munich) in health insurance, as per Numr Research\u2019s Insurance NPS 2019 survey.\n\nEnd-to-end Tech Solutions\u2014Products, Documents and Claims\n\nDigit integrates technology-enabled processes across distribution, buying and claims processing.\n\n\u201cThe use of ML, AI and image analytics help us in faster fraud management and claims settlement,\u201d says Goyal. For instance, in the case of bike insurance AI-based technology solutions recognise basic checks like bike registration number, the colour of the bike, etc, which not only speeds up the process of inspection but also of policy issuance.\n\nSimilarly, travel insurance policies make use of real-time flight tracking to proactively register a claim in case of a delay. \u201cWe provide a three-step, 100 per cent automated claims process for our flight-delay product,\u201d explains Goyal. \u201cIf a flight is delayed beyond 75 minutes, we track it, send the customers an SMS asking for their boarding pass and bank details and process the claim.\u201d In contrast to the industry standard of offering a claim only when the customer\u2019s flight is delayed for over six hours, Digit claims to offer insurance payout for 75 minutes of delay.\n\nThe company also offers an audio claim feature that eliminates the need for the insured to fill long applications. The customer calls to register a claim, which is taped and transcribed to extract and store details for processing the claim.\n\nOn the business side of the things, the all-digital model has reduced the company\u2019s infrastructure and operational costs, as per Goyal. Though Goyal refused to reveal the numbers, a June 2019 report on insurance sector by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that digitisation can reduce around 20\u201330 per cent of the cost of non-life insurance products and 15\u201320 per cent of the cost of life insurance.\n\nDigit\u2019s technology-focused model has garnered sizeable investor interest since the company\u2019s inception. Indo-Canadian business tycoon Prem Watsa, who is chairman and founder of Fairfax Financials Holdings, pumped INR 350 crore into the company in return of 45 per cent stake even before Digit rolled out its operation in November 2017 on getting the regulatory nod. Later, Fairfax invested USD 44 million seed amount in Digit, followed by more in subsequent rounds.\n\nThe Bengaluru-based startup has raised cumulative USD 224 million in funding so far from A91 Partners, Faering Capital and TVS Capital, apart from Fairfax.\n\nEmpowering Partner Companies with API-based Solutions\n\nNot just customers, Digit aspires to simplify the journey of its partner companies as well. It\u2019s application program interface (API) based solutions allows partner companies, which includes insurance aggregator Policybazaar, Flipkart, ClearTrip and Axis Bank, among others, to cancel or make amendments to the policy.\n\n\u201cWe have built a cloud based interface with our partners especially for endorsements and cancellation. When partner companies need to make changes to the policy documents or cancel a policy, they do not need write us email asking for the changes. Instead, they can select the data fields that need to be changed, upload the relevant documents on the portal and the request is processed via a bot,\u201d Goyal explains.\n\nIn the coming months, Digit wants to devise tech solutions to empower Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by offering them zero touch processes, both for claims and policy issuance.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354039", "author": ["Shipra Singh"]}, {"title": "Telegram Is the Latest Company to File An EU Antitrust Complaint Against Apple", "text": "July 30, 2020 2 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on Engadget\n\n\n\nIf big tech thought that its antitrust reckoning would end with yesterday\u2019s hearings, it\u2019ll have its optimism sorely dented by what\u2019s likely to follow. A number of smaller players are lobbing grenades over the fence in the hope of forcing regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to intervene. Today, secure messaging app Telegram is joining in, filing a formal antitrust complaint to the European Union\u2019s competition authority.\n\nAs the Financial Times points out, it\u2019s the third big name, after Spotify and Rakuten, that has lobbied the EU to do something about the App Store\u2019s lock-in and 30 percent commission. And here, as then, the general sentiment is that the commission is too high, and that not allowing users to download from other sources is harming competition.\n\nA few days ago, Telegram co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov published an open letter concerning Apple\u2019s \u201c30 percent tax on apps.\u201d That includes a claim that running the app store does not cost what Apple generates in revenue, and that app-store fees did not exist in the PC era.

The novel coronavirus has not just endangered human lives but it has also hit the world economy hard and impacted several industries around the globe. It has turned markets around, giving rise to trends and disruptions we could not have imagined.\n\nRetail is clearly one of the most severely impacted industries by the pandemic. In the past six months, retailers and consumer goods manufacturers across India have dealt with fast-changing consumer buying patterns and numerous setbacks in ensuring smooth business operations.\n\nThe pandemic has changed the way millions of Indians live, the way they work, the way they shop and even the things they shop. As people hibernated indoors, online stockpiling of essentials skyrocketed and the demand for fast and safe home deliveries increased tremendously. At the same time, to avoid crowded supermarkets, people are going for contactless shopping alternatives such as Zomato, Swiggy, Grofers, BigBasket and Dunzo.\n\nHyperlocal delivery is emerging as a growing trend in the Indian market, as more and more storekeepers are now adopting multichannel strategies to cater to customer demands. This webinar by Entrepreneur India, features key players in retail and logistics who examines the impact this public health emergency has had on the practice-related aspects and how they can prepare for the future by remodeling new business models now.\n\nConvenience over cost\n\nHyperlocal groups come in a huge variety of sizes, leadership styles, and goal-orientations, but they all share one crucial trait: they exist to create value and return value back to their local communities. They collaborate to access resources together, such as group purchases of groceries to limit individual exposure to health risks.\n\nTo respond to the current crisis and meet future ones, food retailers need to use technology in new and different ways to scale up their e-commerce establishments and their capacity for home delivery. They can do so by expanding shifts in existing warehouses and converting a few retail locations into convenient stores. They can also use technology to enable their business and support consumers, not only by increasing their self-checkouts but also by looking end to end and considering how technology can make things safer for customers. Both e-commerce improvements and tech enablement will require new capabilities and talent possibly from other industries or an investment in retraining current employees.\n\nPaytm Mall has launched several initiatives to help stressed businesses including its merchant partners, small shop owners, SMEs as the COVID-19 pandemic has brought their businesses to a standstill. The company will help shops and stores, which have either witnessed a sharp decline in footfall or had to abruptly halt operations due to the lockdown, digitally enabling them through Paytm Mall and giving them all the necessary logistics support. \"Paytm Mall has always advocated a 100 per cent marketplace model of operation against an inventory led one as pursued by other major players. Our objective is to connect neighborhood offline stores to interested customers far and wide through our e-commerce platform,\" says Srinivas Mothey, senior vice-president, Paytm Mall. \u201cA lot of interesting integrations are happening right now so it is a very collaborative space at this time rather than looking at purely competition and taking away market share is not advisable,\u201d he adds.\n\nAs coronavirus has spread around the world, even as most physical grocery stores remain open, many consumers, fearing for the health and safety of themselves and their loved ones, have sought to eliminate all but the most essential visits to stores from their daily or weekly routines.\n\nAs a result, many grocery retailers have seen their online sales increase at an astounding rate. Perhaps no companies operating within the online grocery sector have seen the shift in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as much as hyperlocal delivery services that focus primarily on the grocery space, as consumers in many markets have turned to these companies to have groceries delivered from their favorite local supermarkets. \u201cRetailers will have to survive, adapt to the new digitization and eventually have to come around if they want to sustain in the market,\u201d says co-founder of Ninjacart, Vasudevan Chinnathambi.\n\nWith demand for grocery delivery at an all-time high, legacy grocers that do not operate their own delivery services\u2014and may have been reluctant to hand over a slice of their sales to third-party service partners in the past\u2014are now scrambling to work with hyperlocal players. As a result, hyperlocal grocery delivery sales have exploded.\n\nAlthough most grocery retailers around the world have been rightly classified as \u201cessential\u201d businesses during the pandemic and remained open, consumers\u2019 needs have rapidly changed during this unusual time. As a result, companies operating in the food retail and delivery space need to rapidly adapt new technology to meet the needs of consumers looking to reduce the time they spend in stores, substitute in-person interactions with digital touch points, and smooth out the checkout, payment and logistics experiences. Most companies will not be able to complete transformation of an entire channel overnight, but all can think about small steps to meet the new needs of shoppers.\n\nOne such relatively quick, low-cost solution has been seen in the form of partnerships between hyperlocal delivery services and grocery retailers. However, although in the short-run these on-demand delivery services will prove essential for many shoppers and retailers alike, the expected global recession in 2020 will have a negative impact on any possible permanent consumer behavior shifts given that delivery costs of such services remain high and may prove prohibitive as a long-term grocery delivery solution.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an opportunity of a lifetime as we are learning about crisis that while there was a crisis and there will still continue to be a crisis for some time to come as we are seeing this excellent opportunity to rethink and rewrite business models to improve our economics that can allows us to deliver our services at better year of economics. We are already seeing improvement in business economics across the board, it is also helping us recognize some short-term and permanent changes in consumer behavior which we have never predicted before,\u201d says Prashant Mehta, partner at Lightbox. \u201cConsumers are seeing that the ability of transparency they are getting in terms of quality of products, the fact that they are certain that these are no-contact deliveries, they are getting information for temperatures of people that are delivering their goods. They are clearly getting a better sense of security and in turn it has helped us retool a significant part of our businesses,\u201d mentions Mehta.\n\nThe hyperlocal business model is here to stay, even after the pandemic drifts away. It offers tremendous scope for growth in a number of sectors beyond groceries and essentials, such as food and beverages, medicines, home services, cabs, and hyperlocal logistics, to name a few. It is time for retailers to keep up with the trend and make the most of the hyperlocal delivery model to stay ahead of the competition in post-COVID-19 times.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/video/353761", "author": ["Prabhjeet Bhatla"]}, {"title": "Entrepreneur Pick: #5 Top Fitness Trackers/ Smartwatches with Good Battery Life Under INR 5000", "text": "July 27, 2020 3 min read\n\nThe new-age tech innovation is enhancing the functionality and widening the options in the fitness segment.

Game over.\n\nIt was all part of the event Shaq's Fun House vs Gronk Beach, which featured the larger-than-life personalities squaring off in a series of goofy challenges, with appearances by DaBaby, Snoop Dogg, Steve Aoki, Diplo and more.\n\nThe event, which raised money for the NAACP and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and delivered 1.25M meals to Feeding America, was produced by Medium Rare, a live and brand activation company.\n\nRelated: How Shaq Is Bringing Fun Back to Papa John's\n\nEntrepreneur spoke with Medium Rare\u2019s co-founders, Joe Silberzweig and Adam Richman, about what it takes to pull off an event like this, and what they see in the near future for the live events industry. Here are some of the highlights of that conversation.\n\nLife in the live events business\n\nAdam Richman: It hasn't been talked about much, and there aren't any bills from Congress really aimed at helping out concert promoters or people in the live entertainment industry. We know a lot of our colleagues and friends who are really hurting. It\u2019s really been hard for them to do anything during this time, and that's sort of where we stood a few months ago. We were sitting there saying, \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d And that's when the lightbulb went off. \u201cLet's go virtual!\" It worked so great with Gronk and Shaq\u2019s two special brands. We don\u2019t know exactly what the future will bring in terms of in-person or hybrid events, but everything we\u2019re planning for November and December will be 100 percent virtual.\n\nVirtual events can be more than a glorified Zoom call\n\nJoe Silberzweig: There have been hundreds of live streams events since the pandemic hit, but most of them are Zoom calls or Instagram Lives with pretty janky quality.

We had a national press conference, did a full-on social campaign, email blast \u2014 really treated it like we would any of our big events. And we think that allowed us to shine through. It gave consumers the confidence that this wasn't going to just be another basic live stream.\n\nUnforeseen challenges\n\nJS: The music talent we worked with are used to performing in an arena with a million dollars of production behind them. So you can\u2019t just say, \"Hey, can you rap in front of your living room couch?\u201d So this challenged us to figure out ways to make it look like a music video, not just something streaming off someone\u2019s phone. We knew we needed to the highest production values possible while keeping staff and talent safe.\n\nAR: And for big live events, a challenge can be making sure artists are at the venue and ready to go on time. It was a little shocking that for a virtual event, it is sort of the same thing! You know, where we FaceTimed one or two of the artists to bring them onto the screen, and they pick up and they are in their car driving. So some things never change!\n\nStaying calm in the storm\n\nJS: During the game of HORSE between Shaq and Gronk, we had a tech issue. So Adam and I were freaking out. I think 5 million people watching at that time and it was all pretty nuts. But our team worked through the issue and got it working and instantly at that moment, Shaq ripped off the rim. And that was really the biggest, most viral moment of the entire livestream. Now, I say we were freaking out, but that was on the inside.

The league's approach, which adheres to a 113-page document of protocols outlining strict isolation and mitigation measures, has been described as operating within a \"bubble.\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver doesn't favor the phrase, but he has to be enjoying all the praise being thrown his way, particularly on the heels of announcing that precisely zero of his players have tested positive for each of the last two weeks. (The WNBA, which kicked off games on July 25, is stationed in a similar bubble setup at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, though accounts of their accommodations have been mixed at best, and several players tested positive as recently as three weeks prior to competition.)\n\nMajor League Baseball, meanwhile, concretized far more flexible parameters concerning players' off-field movements before initiating an abbreviated 60-game ledger on July 24. And already, one club \u2014 the Miami Marlins \u2014 has been gripped by an outbreak that's sidelined 17 players and two coaches as of this writing and put its, and MLB's, restarted season in serious jeopardy.\n\nWith the NHL set to experiment with a frenzied playoff format taking place entirely in Canada this weekend, and the pledging to proceed with business as usual on Sept. 10, it's not too early to assess how each of the four major American professional sports' commissioners have acquitted themselves as leaders. So without further delay \u2014 whether or not one feels this whole conversation should be deferred until 2021 \u2014 here's how we grade the ultimate shot-callers' -era poise.\n\nRelated: How the Pandemic is Driving Innovation in Sports Business\n\nThe League: Major League Baseball\n\nThe Commissioner: Rob Manfred\n\nHow's He Leading? It hasn't been an easy half-decade on top for Manfred, who just weathered the Houston Astros' sign-stealing controversy before the pandemic torpedoed his 2020 season right in the midst of spring training. He has had to contend with a tenacious players union that was fairly intransigent when it came to limiting off-field comings-and-goings, but ultimately MLB's mitigation efforts \u2014 which rely largely on individual accountability as clubs travel from one regional city to the next and attempt to rein in familiar, touchy-feely in-game rituals \u2014 are far too vulnerable to further viral spread, as we've already seen. And although laissez-faire managers and undisciplined players aren't helping, it's Manfred who looks most exposed as an ineffective administrator.\n\nGrade: C\n\nThe League: NHL\n\nThe Commissioner: Gary Bettman\n\nHow's He Leading? For once, the league's oft-maligned longtime leader looks prescient by comparison. The decision to relocate north of the border \u2014 to a pair of sites in Edmonton and Toronto \u2014 for a fast-and-furious 24-team playoff tourney makes both practical sense and piques anticipation for what is already the NHL's most widely watched run of games. And given that MLB's lone Canadian-based franchise, the Toronto Blue Jays, weren't even OK'd to touch down in the country and have been exiled to Buffalo, New York, Bettman's early commitment to get out of dodge looks downright ingenious. As for his boasts that 2020-21 will be hiccup-free, he sounds a bit more like the next guy on our docket.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nThe League: NFL\n\nThe Commissioner: Roger Goodell\n\nHow's He Leading? Well, one front \u2014 acknowledging players' rights to express their feelings about what's going on in the world outside of the gridiron \u2014 Goodell has finally evolved beyond his reputation as hopelessly in thrall of team owners' wants and wealth. That said, he and the NFL have been characteristically hubristic from jump when it comes to the pandemic, hyping draft picks and free-agent activity like it were 1999 and going full steam ahead with plans for a steady 17-week schedule at all 31 stadiums, fan attendance be damned (though they were slow to concede to that hard truth). And even this month, players were vocal about feeling unprotected from the inherent risks, prompting assurances of more robust testing procedures. Effectively, the NFL is MLB inverted: The players are forcing their league to properly insulate them from the virus (there have been dozens of positive cases heading into training camps), despite Goodell and the NFL's comparatively cavalier tone. We'll see how Goodell responds if and when a Marlins-like crisis comes to fore, but for the time being, he's mostly taking cues from his personnel rather than charting a consoling course.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nRelated: Niche Sports Leagues Entrepreneurs Can Learn About, and Profit From\n\nThe League: NBA\n\nThe Commissioner: Adam Silver\n\nHow's He Leading: By example. And definitively. As alluded to earlier, he spearheaded the immediate compilation of comprehensive instructions on how all players and personnel are expected to comport themselves. And this thing is detailed, down to who can swim in which pool at the complex and how to properly procure snacks on-site. Silver got some flack back in March for hoarding tests when there was scattered public access to them, and there is certainly still a pertinent debate about whether sports should be prioritized by private labs as case counts surge across the country. But the facts on the ground are that sports are back, whether it's our personal preference or not. And Silver has at least led the way in ensuring that his league won't be responsible for compounding community spread and further burdening frontline workers. That he has the virtually unquestioned support of the league's biggest stars speaks as much to their values as Silver's influence, but considering that the NBA was once a cautionary coronavirus tale (see: Rudy Gobert), the turnaround in perception and reality is remarkable.\n\nGrade: A", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354029", "author": ["Kenny Herzog"]}, {"title": "Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook Execs Face Congress: 9 Big Takeaways", "text": "July 30, 2020 12 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on PCMag\n\n\n\nThe CEOs of Apple, Amazon, , and Facebook faced the House Judiciary Committee virtually today, where they fielded questions about whether their respective tech companies take advantage of their dominant positions in the market to enhance their bottom lines.\n\nSpoiler: They all said they don\u2019t.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg offered rosy assessments of their platforms during opening statements. But the limited time each member of Congress got to ask questions didn\u2019t allow for much additional explanation from the CEOs, many of whom are used to answering questions with winding speeches full of Silicon Valley platitudes.\n\nRelated: Want to Rank Higher in Google and Amazon Search? This $29 Course Can Help.\n\nMembers on both sides of the aisle had bones to pick with the CEOs. The Democrats largely focused on the antitrust issues at hand: whether Amazon keeps its third-party sellers on a tight leash; if Google favors its own products in search; whether Facebook\u2019s acquisitions served only to thwart competition; and if Apple\u2019s fabled walled-garden approach persists.\n\nSome Republicans did, too, but a few veered off course to quiz the execs on pet projects: Google allegedly discriminating against conservatives; Google pulling out of the Pentagon\u2019s JEDI project; and why a certain member\u2019s campaign emails keep ending up in his father\u2019s spam folder.\n\nThe four-hour-plus hearing covered a lot of ground, and some topics were more interesting than others. Here are some of the highlights.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook-Instagram: Illegal Merger or a Savvy Dealmaking?\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) accused Facebook of breaking antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram back in 2012 because it knew Instagram posed a potential threat to its hold over the social media market.\n\n\u201cIn your own words you bought Instagram to neutralize the competitive threat. This was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction,\u201d Nadler claimed, citing internal documents provided by Facebook. \u201cWhy should Instagram not be broken off into a separate company?\u201d\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged he saw Instagram as a competitor, but only in the mobile-photo sharing space. The FTC also scrutinized and approved the acquisition in 2012. \u201cI think with hindsight, it probably looks obvious that Instagram would\u2019ve reached the scale it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\u201d he said, citing other top platforms of the time, like the now-defunct Path.\n\nAccording to Zuckerberg, Instagram\u2019s success is largely due to Facebook\u2019s investment. \u201cI think this has been an American success story,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: Apple, Comcast, Alphabet Among Big Companies Pledging Money to Fight Inequality\n\nNadler disagreed. \u201cRather than compete with [Instagram], Facebook bought it. This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should have never happened in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (Photo by Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nAre You Threatening Me?\n\nNadler and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, (D-Washington), both brought up Zuckerberg\u2019s negotiations with Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom ahead of the merger.\n\n\u201cIn a chat you told Mr. Systrom that Facebook \u2018was developing our own photo strategy, so how we engage now will also determine how much we are partners versus competitors down the line,\u2019\u201d Rep. Jayapal noted. \u201cInstagram\u2019s founder seemed to think that was a threat. He confided in an investor at the time that he feared you would go into \u2018destroy mode\u2019 if he didn\u2019t sell Instagram to you.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg denied it was a threat and characterized his email as a negotiating tactic. \u201cI think it was clear this was a space where we were going to compete in, one way or another,\u201d he said.\n\nPreventing Imminent Risk of Life\n\nTwitter was not present at today\u2019s hearing, but its policies came up nonetheless. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, asked Zuckerberg why it had temporarily banned Donald Trump Jr. this week for sharing a COVID-19 conspiracy theory. Zuckerberg noted that it was Twitter, not Facebook, that took action against the president\u2019s son. But Zuckerberg explained why the move was probably the correct one.\n\nThe video shared by Trump, Jr. featured a doctor who said that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19, which it does not. So while Facebook allows discussion around trials for drugs or personal experiences with experimental drugs, it does not allow people to definitively state that there is a cure for a disease when there isn\u2019t one, Zuckerberg said.\n\n\u201cIn general...we do not want to be the arbiters of truth,\u201d Zuckerberg continued. But if \u201csomeone is going to go out and say that hydroxychloroquine is proven to clear COVID and that statement could lead people to take a drug \u2026 we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of life.\u201d\n\nLater in the hearing, Pichai agreed with that line of thinking when Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, asked why the video in question was also removed from YouTube.\n\n\u201cWe believe in freedom of expression and there\u2019s a lot of debate on effective ways to deal with COVID. But during a pandemic, we look to local health authorities [and] the CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation and [how it] might cause harm in the real world,\u201d Pichai said.\n\nAmazon\n\nJeff Bezos (Photo by Graeme Jennings-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nNo One Company Should Dominate\n\nQuestions for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos mainly focused on the company\u2019s relationship with third-party sellers. Last year, Amazon\u2019s general counsel told Congress that Amazon does not scrape data from third-party sellers to develop competing products. But in April, the Wall Street Journal reported that it does, in fact, do that.\n\nBezos today acknowledged that there might be some truth to the Journal story, but he wasn\u2019t entirely sure. \u201cWe have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business, but I can\u2019t guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.\u201d\n\nAmazon continues \u201cto look into that very carefully,\u201d Bezos continued. \u201cI\u2019m not yet satisfied that we\u2019ve gotten to the bottom of that,\u201d citing the fact that some of the Journal\u2019s sources spoke to the paper anonymously.\n\nRep. Jayapal, who represents Amazon\u2019s homestate of Washington, argued that such behavior could prevent the next big tech giant from emerging. \u201cThe whole goal of this committee is to make sure there are more Amazons [and] Apples and small businesses get to thrive\u201d; no one company should dominate, she said.\n\nCustomer Service Nightmare\n\nRep. Lucy McBath (D-Georgia) played testimony from a book seller who claims she was delisted from selling on Amazon without any explanation. \u201cAs we grew, we were shrinking Amazon\u2019s market share in the textbooks category,\u201d the unnamed seller said. \u201cSo now in retaliation, Amazon started restricting us from selling.\" According to McBath, the seller messaged Amazon over 500 times, but never got a response.\n\nBezos said: \u201cI don\u2019t even understand what\u2019s going on in that anecdote, because we love for third-party sellers to sell books.\u201d\n\nHowever, McBath said numerous third-party merchants have told the Congressional committee about similar instances involving Amazon undermining their businesses. \u201cThere are more sellers who have exhausted all of their options before finally reaching out to you as last resort. But they are still waiting for your response,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI do not think systematically that\u2019s what\u2019s going on,\u201d Bezos responded, arguing that even allowing third parties on Amazon.com was a \u201cvery controversial decision\u201d 20 years ago. \u201cWe did that because we were convinced it would be better for the consumer. And I think we were right.\n\nRep. David Cicilline (Photo by Graeme Jennings-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, claimed the company was creating an \u201cinherent conflict of interest\u201d with its third-party merchants, especially since \u201cAmazon can set the rules of the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis investigation makes clear that Amazon\u2019s dual role as a platform operator and a competing seller on that platform is fundamentally anti-competitive, and Congress must take action,\u201d Cicilline claimed.\n\nGoogle\n\nSundar Pichai (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / POOL / AFP)\n\nStealing Content\n\nCicilline quizzed Pichai about why it was \u201cstealing content\u201d from businesses to bolster its own and only displaying content in search results that\u2019s most profitable for Google. Not surprisingly, Pichai took issue with that characterization, arguing in part that most product searches originate on Amazon, not Google.\n\nPichai\u2019s style, however, did not really lend itself to the rapid-fire nature of today\u2019s hearing, and he didn\u2019t really get to complete many thoughts before time-limited members were forced to move on.\n\n\u2018Big Tech Is Out to Get Conservatives\u2019\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (Photo by Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nRepublicans also took aim at Google, with allegations that it censors conservative viewpoints on Google Search and via YouTube.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just cut to the chase: Big tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) in his opening statement. He later demanded Google pledge to avoid siding with the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden during the ongoing election.\n\n\u201cCan you assure us today, you are not going to try and silence conservatives?\u201d Jordan asked. Pichai said: \u201cYou have my commitment, it\u2019s always been true. And we\u2019ll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way.\u201d (After the exchange, Rep. Mary Scanlon, a Pennsylvania Democrat, dismissed Jordan\u2019s line of questioning as \u201cfringe conspiracy theories,\u201d prompting a fiery back and forth between both sides of the aisle.)\n\nChina\u2019s Corporate Espionage Playbook\n\nRepublicans also quizzed Pichai about why Google was willing to work with China, but not with the Pentagon?\n\nIn 2018, Google pulled out of a US Defense Department project following internal protests from company employees. It later said it would not allow Google AI technology to be used as a weapon or for surveillance and that it would refuse to develop any AI projects that will \"cause or are likely to cause overall harm.\"\n\nIn the same year, however, news emerged that Google was secretly developing a search engine for China that would not only censor content, but also potentially allow government authorities to track people\u2019s website lookups. Google later abandoned the search engine. But today, Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colorado) questioned whether the company was following \u201cChina\u2019s corporate espionage playbook.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said: \u201cFirst of all we are proud to support the US government,\u201d while citing the company\u2019s recent partnership with the US Defense Department to secure the Pentagon from cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cWe have a very limited presence in China,\u201d Pichai added. \u201cWe don\u2019t offer any of our services\u2014Search, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, etc.\u2014in China.\u201d\n\nApple\n\nTim Cook (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u2018A Street Fight for Market Share\u2019\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook got off relatively easy during today\u2019s hearing. However, Rep. Henry Johnson (D-Georgia) did grill him about the iOS App Store, the sole way iPhone owners can download mobile apps. (Last month, the European Union launched its own antitrust investigation into the store\u2019s policies.)\n\nCurrently, Apple takes a 30 to 15 percent cut of all in-app purchases on the store. \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop Apple from increasing its commission to 50 percent?\u201d Johnson asked, to which Cook noted that commissions have never increased in the App Store\u2019s 12-year history.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to stop you from doing so, is it?\u201d Johnson then asked.\n\n\u201cNo sir, I disagree strongly with that,\u201d Cook replied. \u201cThere\u2019s a competition for developers, just like there\u2019s a competition for customers.\u201d Those same developers can choose to write apps for other platforms, such as Android, Windows, and Xbox. \u201cSo we have fierce competition on the developer side, and the customer side, which is essentially so competitive, I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business,\u201d Cook said.\n\nHe went on to say that Apple never retaliates or bullies iOS developers for complaining about its policies. However, Johnson said the company still holds sole discretion over which apps get allowed on the iOS App Store. \u201cDevelopers have no choice but to go along with the changes, or they must leave the App Store. That\u2019s an enormous amount of power,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nRep. Cicilline said House Judiciary will publish a report on the Antitrust Subcommittee's finding, which will propose solutions. but \"this hearing has made one fact clear to me: These companies as they exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable,\" he concluded.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354012", "author": ["Chloe Albanesius", "Michael Kan"]}, {"title": "Make This Pandemic the Reason You Publish Your First Video", "text": "July 30, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe pandemic has had devastating effects worldwide. You know this. I know this. We all know this. It has affected every area of life for billions of people and, for many of us, doesn\u2019t seem to be ending anytime soon. The sad reality is we all know at least one local business that couldn\u2019t sustain the catastrophic loss and made the heartbreaking decision to close its doors permanently.\n\nDuring this time, we\u2019ve seen many service-based businesses transform day-to-day operations and products, or pivot entirely, in order to survive these darker times. We\u2019ve also witnessed certain industries modify their service and adjust to the circumstances to effectively wait out the storm.\n\nA good example of visible brands who have done their best to modify how they operate would be some of our favorite talk shows, such as The View, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert billed as A Late Show with Stephen Colbert, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah billed as The Daily Social Distancing Show, and Late Night with Seth Meyers. The hosts and their respective production teams have proven once again that in this age of technology all we really need is good internet connection and a little ingenuity.\n\nWhile it\u2019s no secret that many of these show hosts have openly expressed frustration due to limited resources and creative opportunities, not to mention seeing more than a handful of technical difficulties and on-air snafus that would have normally been edited out, this could also serve as a glimmer of inspiration for many small business owners. The reason is, most people think of talk show hosts as being television superstars. But being a star on camera is a heck of a lot easier when you\u2019re on a legit soundstage with an entire team of professionals handling all the technical details. It\u2019s a completely different story when that same person is forced to record from the attic or spare bedroom and has to multitask handling the bulk of operations.\n\nIf these television heavyweights can put together enough content to cover multiple segments spanning anywhere from 20-40 minutes on a daily basis using only their laptops and smart devices coupled with downloadable software and free social media apps; then there\u2019s no excuse for entrepreneurs who are hesitant to use these same readily available tools to communicate with their customers. Starting out, this could be a very simple three-minute delivered on a weekly basis for the purpose of informing customers and building awareness. That\u2019s it. It doesn\u2019t need to be elaborate and this can be easily incorporated into your online marketing strategy.\n\nFor those who have been on the fence with video content creation or have been reluctant to start for one reason or another, then let this worldwide slowdown be the exact opportunity you\u2019ve been waiting for to begin. Time is no longer a factor because the pandemic has afforded most of us more than enough time on our hands. As mentioned above, many nationally recognized and admired talk show hosts have openly shared their previously limited expertise with technology and the need for a crash course in software and social media tools if they had any hope of staying connected with their fans. They\u2019ve also laughed about the many glitches and blunders with their makeshift home studios. If they can do this to reach their millions of viewers nationwide then you can do it to reach the people in your online sphere.\n\nRelated: Connecting With Your Target Audience Through Video\n\nTo help get the ball rolling, let\u2019s focus our attention on three main areas.\n\n1. Choose content that your audience wants to know about.\n\nTake a moment to think about those frequently asked questions that you receive. These could be common questions about your particular service, the industry in general, or typical problems and pain points of your ideal customers. Imagine someone approached you to ask one of these very common questions. How would you respond to address the individual\u2019s concern? More than likely, you\u2019ve answered this question so many times that providing a thought-out response would be second nature. Well, that\u2019s all you\u2019re doing with these informative and content rich videos for your audience. The only difference being that this conversation will be rehearsed and recorded for public consumption.\n\nTypically, I\u2019ll have my clients write down ten frequently asked questions or common problems their customers face. That\u2019s all we need to begin. Once you have these ten key points written down, then it\u2019s time to take a closer look at how you\u2019ll structure and deliver the information.\n\n2. Choose a format that can be easily applied. Here are three basic video styles:\n\nQ&A \u2013 Pose the frequently asked question at the beginning of the video and then provide your expert answer. Be sure to include supporting information for the sake of clarity. Remember your viewer probably doesn\u2019t have your extensive background and knowledge base so keep it simple.\n\nDid You Know \u2013 This informative style can be causal and even conversational as you express your message. You\u2019ve probably started thousands of friendly discussions like this over your lifetime. Use this format to build awareness with your audience.\n\nHow To \u2013 Just as it sounds, this format shows the person how to do something. It may sound counterintuitive because you\u2019re essentially teaching the person how to do something that you would normally be paid to do. But that\u2019s the beauty of it. By doing this, you are teaching the viewer how to do an easier and smaller job, perhaps even one that you wouldn\u2019t have the time to do, which establishes credibility and proves you are an expert because you just solved the problem in front of their eyes. Empowering your audience to learn more about your work establishes trust and builds rapport, plus it increases the likelihood that they will return for more direct assistance when they need help solving those bigger and more complex issues.\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons Why You Need Video in Your Marketing Strategy (With ...\n\n3.

It doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. It just needs to be professional. Practice makes progress. Like anything in life, the more you do it the better you\u2019ll become. In the beginning the videos might take a little bit longer until you find your flow and delivery style. This will come in time. Stay focused on the objective, which is to create a premium piece of original content that will educate your audience and provide an opportunity to engage in a personal and direct manner.\n\nCreating original content like this allows you to build value and stay connected with your audience. It provides a platform to demonstrate your skills and expertise. You won\u2019t need to tell them that you\u2019re an expert because you\u2019ll be demonstrating your proficiency right in front of them. Actions speak louder than words and this will prove how good you are with every new video published.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like this pandemic will be going away anytime soon and the medical experts emphasize the need for flexibility and frequent adjustments. But you can use this time to differentiate yourself as a proven leader in your market by creating video content that attracts your ideal customers.

Former Vice President Joe Biden announced his intention to get rid of President Trump\u2019s $2 trillion tax cut, which if enacted, would have a direct impact on the finances of businesses and .\n\nHere are six components of Biden's plan that business owners should be aware of:\n\n1. Real estate investors will lose tax incentives\n\nInvestors could have many incentives taken away under Biden\u2019s proposed tax plan. Much of his $775 billion \u201ccaring economy\u201d plan will be financed by taxes on real estate investors with incomes of $400,000 and above. This would be done by eliminating the 1031 exchange that allows investors to swap investment properties for another that is \u201clike-kind.\u201d He is also proposing to eliminate bonus depreciation for real estate and intangible drilling cost and depletion deductions for oil and gas development.\n\nRelated: When Will Your Next Stimulus Check Arrive?\n\n2. Capital gains tax will increase\n\nCurrently, the long-term capital gains (assets held longer than a year) tax rate is 20 percent for single households with more than $441,451 in taxable income ($496,601 for married-filing-jointly) in 2020. Under Biden\u2019s proposed plan, he would raise taxes on capital gains by treating them as ordinary income for those earning more than $1 million. In addition, the plan calls to increase the 37 percent ordinary income rate set by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) up to 39.6 percent. That means for those who would pay the top rate in capital gains, their rates would almost double from 23.8 percent to 43.4 percent. One of the biggest impacts would be in the year you sell your business, where your capital gains alone will likely put you over $1 million of taxable income.\n\n3. Corporate income tax rate will jump to 28 percent\n\nTCJA lowered corporate income tax for US resident C-corporations significantly from 35 percent to 21 percent, but Biden\u2019s plan would implement an increase to 28 percent. One way to avoid this increase is to choose the right business entity. By setting up your business as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC) or S-corporation, you\u2019ll be taxed as a pass-through entity, thus avoiding entity-level tax. In addition, you may qualify for the 20 percent pass-through deduction for small business, lowering your taxes even more. This will also have an impact on planning for the sale of the business using the Section 1202 exclusion.\n\n4. Qualified business income deductions for income above $400,000 will be phased out\n\nThe TCJA provided many owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations a deduction that allowed taxpayers to deduct up to 20 percent of their qualified business income (QBI), plus 20 percent of qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends and qualified publicly traded partnership (PTP) income. Biden\u2019s plan calls to phase out this deduction for income above $400,000, eliminating another great tax benefit for entrepreneurs.\n\nRelated: New Legislation Would Grant Automatic Forgiveness of PPP Loans Under $150,000\n\n5. Incentives for charitable donations could be reduced\n\nWhile the TCJA nearly doubled the standard deduction for single, head of household and married taxpayers, there are still individuals who prefer itemized deductions. Under Biden\u2019s reform, the value of itemized deductions would be limited to 28 percent. Many charities are concerned about this change as they believe it would limit the amount of donations they would receive as it would limit the incentive to make charitable contributions.\n\n6. The cap on social security taxes for income above $400,000 will be eliminated\n\nBiden\u2019s current plan creates a donut hole in Social Security, where everything above the current limit of $137,700 and below $400,000 isn\u2019t taxed and income above $400,000 would be subject to Social Security taxes at 12.4 percent split evenly between employers and employees.\n\nTake the time to understand each candidate\u2019s tax plan and how they will affect your business when considering your decision this election season.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353774", "author": ["Tom Wheelwright"]}, {"title": "The Top Four Mistakes Beginners Make With Their First Facebook Ad Campaign", "text": "July 30, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet started , it\u2019s high time you do. Recent statistics from Hootsuite show that the average Facebook user clicks on 11 ads per month. Although many believe Facebook is on the decline after last year\u2019s privacy violations came under scrutiny, it still makes up for 40 percent of annual digital display advertising revenue, according to the Pew Research Center. That\u2019s second only to one: Google.\n\nWith all the opportunity from a Facebook ad campaign, it\u2019s a preferred avenue for new business owners ready to get exposure for their product. However, as easy as Facebook Ads Manager makes the ad creation process, there\u2019s a great deal of behind-the-scenes work that first needs to be accomplished. In fact, many beginners fall into mistake traps when creating their first campaign. These are the top four most common mistakes to make sure you avoid.\n\nRelated: The Complete Guide to Getting Started With Facebook Ads\n\n1. Slacking on the quality of the creatives and the copy\n\nNowadays, companies that win with ads are those that have the best creative approach. A compelling video, catchy graphic and magnetic copy goes a long way \u2014 it gets potential customers to pay attention. Focus your efforts here first, because if you can\u2019t get a potential customer to stop their scrolling and actually read or engage with the ad, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best product in the world. Each is as important as the other. For example, you could invest in a high-quality, colorful photo shoot for a powerful image, but if the copy is weak, a prospective customer will still scroll past.\n\nFortunately, Facebook also knows how important each component is and made a new tool that helps ad managers and creatives conduct split tests, matching your creatives with your headlines in different combinations. Facebook created Dynamic Creative, in which an ad creator can upload basic parts of their ideal ad (the copy, the images and more), and the system optimizes and tests different combinations for you, as you never fully know how they\u2019ll perform until they\u2019re tested.\n\nSpecifically, testing creative is one of the best ways to boost conversions. According to Nielsen, \u201c49 percent of a brand\u2019s sales lift from advertising is due to the creative.\u201d There are some headlines and video creatives that can generate a few hundred percent more in ROI.\n\nRelated:Don't Even Think About Facebook Ads Until You Have These 5 Things In Place\n\n2. Not knowing your objective\n\nIt\u2019s great if you want to use an ad campaign to spark more awareness about your business or product, but this is really more an implicit consequence of running ads. Get clear on what your main objective is from running them, which is important not only for how you create the ads themselves, but also for what you select as your ad objective on Facebook. This objective determines how the Facebook algorithm shows ads to audiences. If the objective hasn\u2019t been pinpointed, it\u2019s likely that Facebook will deliver the ads to the wrong audience, and you won\u2019t get the results that you were planning on. This is one of the easiest ways to sabotage your ads.\n\nSo, what is the objective of your ad campaign? What do you want your customers to do? Is it subscribing to your mailing list? Actually purchasing a product? Booking a demo appointment? This can also factor into the call-to-action that you place within the ad, as customers sometimes need direction as to what your objectives are, too.\n\nRelated: 5 Forbidden Phrases You Absolutely Must Avoid in Your Facebook Ad\n\n3. Making typos or grammatical errors in ad copy\n\nThis sounds obvious, but double, triple and quadruple check the copy for your ads. Typos are an ad killer. Website Planet conducted an experiment to see just how detrimental the presence of typos can be. It found that while the results differed by country (because of language barriers), in the U.S., marketers pay up to 10 percent more for their ad spend when they have a typo \u2014 and in the U.K., 20 percent more for typos and 72 percent more for grammatical errors.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that we make typos and mistakes all the time in writing quick emails or even in our personal Instagram page captions. How you portray yourself and your company in an ad matters. What would you think of a company that had a very obvious, glaring typo in its ad copy? Would you still buy from it, even if you really were interested in its product or service? Even if it doesn\u2019t matter much to you, it does give many customers pause, because the question becomes: \u201cWhat\u2019s the quality of this company\u2019s work if they can\u2019t double check the writing they invested in?\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Simple Steps to Recover a Disabled Facebook Ads Account\n\n4. Having too broad of a target audience\n\nNot narrowing down your audience targeting enough is another common mistake \u2014 also made from the desire for exposure. It\u2019s understandable: You don\u2019t want to cut off a potential demographic that would be interested. For example, if you\u2019re selling a service that reviews grad school applications, you don\u2019t want to limit your target audience to the typical age range for grad school applicants just in case there are a few stragglers applying earlier or later.\n\nHowever, too broad of a target audience can end up costing you both time and money. Black Tie Marketing noted that one of the surefire ways to know that your target is too broad is by surveying the leads you currently have coming through your funnel. Do you get on a phone call with someone and find out that they actually aren\u2019t a qualified lead more often than not? Or, are you getting good impressions and clicks but little follow through? Niche down, in that case. It may diminish the reach, but if you\u2019re reaching more qualified prospects, it\u2019s worth it \u2014 both for your time and theirs.\n\nMy best advice is to start by investing time and research on that first ad campaign, then tweak from there. Go deep by perfecting the ad, create urgency and a clear action plan for interested leads, get more eyeballs on it to avoid typos or poorly written sentences and make sure you\u2019re targeting the right demographic, even if it\u2019s smaller than you thought.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353892", "author": ["Steve Tan"]}, {"title": "Former Republican Presidential Candidate Herman Cain Has Died After Being Hospitalized for Coronavirus", "text": "July 30, 2020 3 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on Business Insider\n\n\n\nThe former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after being hospitalized for the novel .

Do you want to future-proof your business with on-demand expertise? Entrepreneur NEXT has the expert solutions your business needs to succeed in an evolving market.\n\nWe don\u2019t give Gen Z the credit they deserve especially since they\u2019re the driving force behind . Yep, that intern or recent grad you\u2019ve been managing the past few weeks \u2014 you know, the one you\u2019ve complained about at least once a day \u2014 will shape how you work five years from now.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it already with millennials, who are prioritizing work-life balance and pushing for flexible, remote work options. By 2025, illennials will make up 75 percent of the workforce, and we have already seen companies evolve so they can cater to millennial work values and best retain talent. (Think: remote work, flex time, an empathetic environment, goals aligned with personal values, etc.)\n\nGen Z, born between 1996 and 2010, is just now entering the workforce and is taking cues from their older generational siblings. The first generation to not know life without widespread internet use, Gen Z has an even bigger technological advantage and influence than millennials. With millennials pushing our current work , it\u2019s only a matter of time before Gen Z evolves how we work.\n\nHere are ways you can look to Gen Z to help forecast the future of work and create the best work environment for this up-and-coming generation.\n\nObserve how they use apps and consume content.\n\nWe can all learn something from Gen Z. From using TikTok as a political protest to making money-saving purchases on Wish instead of traditional ecommerce sites, studying Gen Z app use is, in some ways, looking into a tech crystal ball.\n\nOne trend we\u2019ve seen for years is the switch to mobile-based video. Gen Z grew up in the age of YouTube, and the platform is one of the top social media sites for the generation. YouTube provides an efficient way for them to pick up new skills or learn more about a topic.\n\nAnd as YouTube\u2019s popularity has grown, Gen Z has helped push mobile-centric content. More than half (61 percent) think viewing content on a smartphone is just as good as watching through television. That is a big leap from millennials (63 percent), which prefer to view video content on television.\n\nKnowing mobile is a key part of Gen Z\u2019s communication and content-consumption styles, look to mobile trends, apps that boost efficiency through mobile and ways to make your own website and processes mobile friendly.\n\nThe future of work is here \u2014 at Entrepreneur NEXT, we\u2019re building a smarter way to hire top experts. Save yourself the wasted time typically spent in boring interviews or unnecessary agency pitches \u2014 we\u2019ll take care of the hiring details for you.\n\nEncourage collaboration and interaction.\n\nHuman interaction is big with Gen Z. Surprisingly, the most technologically literate generation actually prefers face-to-face interaction in the workplace, and sees it as more effective than digital-communication tools.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they are averse digital-collaboration averse. They utilize tools like Google Docs, Slack, Microsoft Teams and more to increase collaborative efforts. An Indiana University study found that by using collaborative tools, student satisfaction increased and absenteeism dropped by 50 percent.\n\nGen Z is also the most diverse generation entering the workforce, and that translates to how they prefer their work environments. Out of Gen Z workers, 48 percent are non-caucasian, which helps bring diverse perspectives to the workforce, increasing creativity and innovation. Gen Z values diverse collaboration in a team environment, with 20 percent believing the most important part of a team is diverse cultural perspectives.\n\nOffer room for curiosity.\n\nA very curious generation is entering the workforce. Gen Z is more likely to explore new skills and is hungry for feedback along the way, with 97 percent receptive to regular feedback on their work.To Gen Z, \u201cregular feedback\u201d means a check-in every couple of weeks. For millennials, they prefer feedback at half the rate. When it comes to being managed, 43 percent of Gen Z enjoy a self-directed approach to learning, and 77 percent of them prefer having a millennial manager.\n\nWhat all this means is companies need to foster environments that give employees space to explore and grow their skills, opportunities to learn from their mistakes, and a team environment that values diverse voices.\n\nLike their millennial predecessors, Gen Z is looking for a healthy work-life balance. Burned-out employees are 63 percent more likely to take sick days and three times more likely to leave their job. With seven in 10 millennials experiencing professional burnout, and Gen Z has been watching and taking measures for their own well being.\n\nProvide them with value \u2014 professionally and financially.\n\nWhile Gen Z wants fulfillment in their work, they also want to get paid. Like millennials, Gen Z is concerned about stagnant wages and increasing cost of living expenses like healthcare, housing, student debt and more. The biggest motivators for Gen Z to perform in the workplace are financial incentive and career advancement.\n\nGrowing up, this generation witnessed an economic depression that affected either their families or families they know. They heard horror stories of millennials entering full-time jobs and needing a \u201cside hustle\u201d just to earn enough money to pay necessities. In fact, a 2019 Bankrate survey found 49% of adults 35 and younger have a side hustle and one out of three people who take on a side hustle does so to survive.\n\nSeeing the effects of an economic depression played out during childhood, Gen Z is more likely to take financial precautions. For example, 35 percent plan to get a retirement plan in order during their 20s.\n\nIn order to solidify financial security, Gen Z takes skill-building and professional development seriously in order to advance in career and salary. Growing up digital, these employees understand how technology\u2019s fast-paced nature requires adaptation and skill-building in order to succeed in their careers. Main motivators for Gen Z workers to learn are to improve their job, make money and get promoted - all aligning with the professional and financial value they seek in a career.\n\nWith technology evolving at such a fast pace and a new generation of workers entering their careers, one of the best ways to stay on top of the future of work is to observe how Gen Z works. Ask questions, learn their habits and think about how your company can best implement these trends to increase employee retention and stay ahead of the curve.\n\nForget the large agency fees, complicated contracts, and other BS involved with hiring experts by yourself.

He was speaking to a nation struggling with what was just the beginning of what we now know as the Great Depression. The statement is not completely true since there are plenty of other things to fear, including sharks, taxes and global pandemics. But this much is an absolute fact \u2014 especially for entrepreneurs \u2014 fear can lead to unwise decisions, which can bring about the very negative consequences we wish to avoid. There is indeed much to fear about fear itself. Here are 11 ways to overcome fear during the current crisis or the next one you experience.\n\n1. Name the fear\n\nWhen faced with a crisis and paralyzing fear, the most difficult obstacle in your path may be admitting you are afraid. It\u2019s only once we recognize the reality of the situation that we can deal with it.\n\nOne way to better identify your fear is to imagine the worst that can happen. In her New York Times bestseller Insight, author Tasha Eurich shares a recommendation made by decision psychologist Gary Klein, who advocates a \u201cpre-mortem\u201d for major decisions. The idea is to imagine yourself one year in the future and that everything has gone wrong. Your plans are a total disaster. Then write what that would look like. You might find out the worst that can happen isn\u2019t all that bad, or that you can identify steps to avoid the pitfalls that would lead to disaster.\n\nIn Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl quoted Spinoza\u2019s Ethics, which said: \u201cEmotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.\u201d Or to put it another way, Mr. Rogers said, \u201cAnything that\u2019s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.\u201d\n\nDr. Benjamin Hardy, an organizational psychologist and the author of Personality Isn\u2019t Permanent, shared these quotes with me and then told me, \u201cThe key to overcoming fear is giving it form.\u201d Hardy says this can be done through journaling and open conversation. \"Daily journaling about how you\u2019re feeling, in addition to sharing your feelings with key people in your life, make your emotions manageable.\u201d\n\nHardy says, \u201cDoes this take courage? Absolutely. But it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s worth not being bogged down by fear and needless suffering. When you are open and honest as a person, life becomes far more manageable. You stop needlessly suffering internally about unfulfilled dreams or former hurts. You move forward. And that\u2019s the freaking key! Moving forward! Moving forward as powerfully and authentically as possible.\u201d\n\nRelated: 8 Powerful Phrases Leaders Need to Say in a Time of Crisis\n\n2. Use fear to fuel your courage\n\nThe Japanese poet Kenji Miyazawa said, \u201cWe must embrace pain and consume it for fuel on our journey.\u201d During a crisis, you may hear others say, \u201cNobody can get funded right now,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s time to survive, forget about growth.\u201d Instead, entrepreneurs like Bryan Brandenburg, founder and chief scientist of visualization company Zenerchi, says, \u201cThat\u2019s when I go into warrior mode. Don\u2019t follow the conventional wisdom. It comes from people who are afraid to act or are acting from a place of fear. Instead, look for the opportunities caused by others\u2019 fear.\u201d Or, as Warren Buffet says about how to invest successfully, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful.\u201d\n\n3. Remember the past\n\nWhen faced with a worrying future, it often pays to think about how we overcame challenges in the past. When thinking of what could be lost, Melinda Dransfield, VP of sales performance elevation for Prudential Retirement, asks, \u201cHave I lost this or something like it before? How did I deal with it before?\u201d and then reminds herself, \u201cI have been through hard things before.\u201d\n\nI started my in 1999, just before the dot-com bubble burst. Less than two years later, the economy went into another downturn after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Then there was the 2008 real estate crisis. Now, whenever the business faces difficult circumstances, I tell myself, \u201cYou\u2019ve been here before,\u201d and even if I\u2019m not sure exactly how, I know we\u2019ll get through it.\n\n4. Think past the crisis\n\nImagining a terrible future can help us avoid that future, but what if things work out great? In an April 2020 article in Harvard Business Review, Mark W. Johnson and Josh Suskewicz share perspectives from their book Lead from the Future. They say that though we must take care of the here and now, we can\u2019t lose sight of the bigger picture. Whatever the future holds, they say, \u201cYou need to begin preparing for it now. And to do that right, you need to have a longer-term vision of what you aspire to become in five or even 10 years \u2014 a north star that will focus and help shape your thinking about the short- and mid-term.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m reminded of how I learned to mow straight lines across a large lawn by focusing on a point in the distance, rather than the ground in front of me. Even if I ran into bumps along the way, as long as I kept my eye on that point, when I finished I could look back and see a straight path. Take care of the short term, but keep an eye on what\u2019s to come or you\u2019ll find it difficult to avoid getting pulled in multiple directions.\n\nRelated: You Can't Do Everything, and If You Try to You'll Do Even Less\n\n5. Invest in \u201calive time\u201d\n\nYour business may not be in danger of going under, but perhaps you find yourself with a lot of spare time. Ryan Holiday, author of multiple bestselling books like The Obstacle Is the Way and Ego Is the Enemy, recalls advice he got about such times from another bestselling author, Robert Green (The 48 Laws of Power). \u201cHe told me there are two types of time: alive time and dead time,\u201d Holiday wrote in a recent blog post. \u201cOne is when you sit around, when you wait until things happen to you. The other is when you are in control, when you make every second count, when you are learning and improving and growing.\u201d\n\nCould you use the extra time your business has to retool your systems, train your team, or build new products and services?\n\n6. Build your fear muscle\n\nThink of fear like gravity: With the proper equipment, it can help you become stronger. Noah Kagan, \u201cChief Sumo\u201d at AppSumo.com, likes \u201cthe coffee challenge,\u201d in which you ask for 10 percent off your next purchase. Awkward? Difficult? Scary? That\u2019s the point. Do it repeatedly and it will get easier, not because the task itself is any easier, but because you\u2019ve become stronger.\n\nJia Jiang took this to the ultimate level when he decided to intentionally get rejected 100 times in 100 days. He was inspired after his first attempt at entrepreneurship ended in rejection, leaving Jia emotionally crushed. However, after he recognized his fear of rejection was harming him more than the actual rejection, he decided to embrace rejection in order to become more comfortable with it. His experiences not only helped him become almost immune to rejection but also led to a TED talk on rejection that has been viewed over 6 million times and the bestselling book Rejection Proof.\n\n7. Reevaluate what makes you unique\n\nIn a crisis, it\u2019s easy to lose focus on your business and why it exists and instead get trapped into concerns about next week\u2019s payroll. Of course, short-term concerns are important, but if we focus on them too much we may miss opportunities. \u201cGet very clear on your point of view,\u201d advises Steve Watt, VP of marketing at Grapevine6. \u201cFigure out why (and for whom) your approach offers a way forward in difficult times.\u201d You may have a new customer segment that suddenly cares about your company\u2019s offering in a way they didn\u2019t before.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Zoom, the video conferencing service, in the early months of 2020. As the Covid-19 virus sent tens of millions of students and workers home, Zoom found itself perfectly positioned to help them stay connected. Through outreach (and a healthy dose of word of mouth) Zoom grew from 10 million to daily users in December 2019 to over 300 million daily users by April 2020.\n\nIn a crisis, you can combat fear as you find your new niche and let others know how you can solve their problems.\n\nRelated: How Entrepreneurs Can Find Clarity in Uncertain Times\n\n8. Identify what you can \u2014 and can\u2019t \u2014 control\n\n\u201cFear isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s the crippling uncertainty that comes with it that eats at us,\u201d says Zachary Zimmerman, senior account manager at marketing agency Number Six. To combat that uncertainty, Zimmerman sorts out which aspects of a challenge he has control over and which he doesn\u2019t. This reduces the uncertainty and allows him to focus on what he can change without wasting time on what he can\u2019t.\n\n9. See fear positively\n\nFear isn\u2019t all bad \u2014 sometimes fear keeps us safe from real harm. Fear can also give us motivation. \u201cFear can be a very positive emotion when it sparks in us the behavior required to overcome, and when we are confident in where we are going,\u201d says Andy Cindrich, senior consultant at FranklinCovey.\n\n10. Find the opportunity\n\nMarcus Sheridan\u2019s experience shows why it\u2019s so important to see every moment, even a crisis, as an opportunity. In 2008, the real estate crisis hit, and Sheridan was in the swimming pool business. Despite occupying a market in which many people were worried about losing their homes (not buying new pools), Sheridan saw that pool builders weren't using the internet to answer buyers' questions. He started answering those questions online, and his company\u2019s website became the Wikipedia of swimming pool information. Now his company is the fastest growing fiberglass swimming pool manufacturer in the world.\n\n\u201cWhen Covid-19 hit and I realized that it was going to get ugly, once again my thoughts immediately shifted,\u201d Sheridan says. \u201cI told myself, \u2018Marcus, commit now to find the opportunity in this moment.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn just a few months, Sheridan\u2019s company introduced a virtual sales methodology to its team of dealers all over the country and experienced tremendous success. Despite the pandemic-related economic downturn, in April 2020 Sheridan\u2019s company broke every sales record it has ever had.\n\nRelated: How Three Different Tech Companies Are Tackling the Common Fight Against Coronavirus\n\n11. Don\u2019t give up\n\nAs a senior sales executive, Hunter Sebresos was present for a meeting in which investors were preparing to shut down the company he was working for. However, he knew their customers had a need, so rather than throwing up his hands and trying to find a new job, he came up with a new business model on the spot, pitched it to the investors right then and there, and won funding to create Bacon, a mobile app that allows companies to post details about their temporary staffing jobs straight from their phones and quickly fill positions, rather than spending days or weeks with a staffing or temp agency.\n\nYour company may be on the brink, but is there a way to pivot that gives you a second chance?\n\nThere is always hope\n\nNo matter how bad things get, there\u2019s always hope for a better future. Even at the height of the Great Depression, the unemployment rate was 24.9 percent \u2014 alarming, but it means that 75.1 percent were still employed. Many of the greatest companies of all time were founded during times of great economic challenges. A short list includes Procter & Gamble, IBM, General Electric, General Motors, FedEx, Hyatt, IHOP, Disney, HP, Microsoft, Burger King, CNN and Apple (twice, first during the downturn in 1975, and then when it was resurrected from near-death during the dot-com crash of 2001).\n\nThere may be a global crisis right now, and there are certainly others brewing, but even in a crisis \u2014 especially during a crisis \u2014 there are people out there who need what you have, and there may be no better time to get busy giving it to them.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/350196", "author": ["Josh Steimle"]}, {"title": "Can Psychedelics Help Treat Depression?", "text": "July 24, 2020 1 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nCan psychedelics treat ?

Traditional gyms full of bulky equipment and machines were losing their appeal as people began to embrace smaller, niche fitness studios, personal trainers and even virtual experiences.\n\nWhile the shift may mean trouble for large brands, it is great news for independent fitness instructors who are now not only finding more freedom to work directly with clients, but also to build their own thriving, profitable businesses without the overhead of a corporation.\n\nAfter his own experience with a personal trainer, Eddie Zhang saw this firsthand. He also noticed that the options for instructors to find a good location to train clients outside of a large gym were lacking. So, in 2009, he decided to leave his role as a tax consultant at the IRS and set out to create spaces for instructors to meet and train their clients. And come 2014, Traing Grounds Gym was born.\n\nThe model he created operates like a salon for trainers. He currently has a set of training pods that trainers rent to use with clients. Each pod has a set of equipment that trainers can use for their sessions so they benefit from the materials a typical gym would provide, but with a fraction of the overhead to use them. \u201cI rent them out to trainers, they run their own gym,\u201d says Zhang.\n\nRelated: #7 on the Franchise 500: Planet Fitness Knows You Don't Want to Go to the Gym\n\nBut Zhang is more than just a landlord. He spends a lot of time coaching and mentoring his trainers to help them be successful, providing them with marketing insights, advice and other to help grow and manage their business.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re making six figures or two, you want to start off running your business the right way,\" he explains. \"Number one, I show them the right business model that\u2019s not going to soak up all their time, and that way they don\u2019t have to change it later on down the road,\u201d said Zhang.\n\nSo when new trainers come to use his space, he talks to them about their business model, specifically encouraging them to follow these four critical steps to growing their income to six figures.\n\n1. Specialize\n\nHow do you stand out in a sea of fit, experienced trainers and attract new clients? You offer a specialized service. Either a type of training, addressing problem areas, preparing for milestone events from marathons to a wedding or even specializing by age groups and gender.\n\nOne of the coaches who runs his business out of Training Grounds branded himself as \u201cDoctor Glutes.\" His business is no different than any other coach; he works with a variety of clients who have different goals, including men, but his marketing around stronger and bigger glutes would first get potential prospect\u2019s attention.\n\n2. Market Results, Not Processes\n\nAnother piece of advice Zhang provides trainers he meets with is to focus on the end result. He notes that so often when trainers first start their businesses, they focus too much on the process and the technique or the physical location where training is going to happen.\n\n\u201cIf you focus too much on the process, then you don\u2019t give yourself any room to adapt to changing needs or circumstances,\" he says. \"But if you focus on selling the end result, you can adapt to fit whatever changes and still end up with a happy client.\u201d\n\n3. Find Your Tools\n\nMost trainers aren\u2019t spending much time sitting at a desk in an office every day. They are out on the floor working with their clients. But, as independent business owners, they need to create systems to make sure they don\u2019t double book themselves and to ensure that all of the work they are putting in results in payment. So often, new business owners \u2014 not just trainers \u2014 realize this too late, perhaps after they\u2019ve gone weeks without payment or forgotten to track which clients have paid and which haven\u2019t.\n\nFortunately, there are now some phenomenal tools on the market, including mobile apps, that make it easier to run a business than ever before. The trick is just to find the right one for you.\n\n4. Build Community\n\nTrainer Kaylin Pyles decided to focus on working with women in the 25-35 age range, and what she offers is more than just fitness; she provides her clients with an entire community to support their goals.\n\nWhen a new client signs up, Pyles adds them to the online community, encouraging other members to welcome the new person. The online community provides her clients with extra accountability and friendship within the community. But it also helps Kaylin run her business more efficiently. Members often answer each other's own questions in the channel so they don't necessarily have to be online all day, answering questions or providing extra words of encouragement. In just a few months, Pyles has moved from making an hourly wage at a gym to pulling in a healthy, six-figure salary, all while doing what she loves and working for herself.\n\nRelated: 5 of the Best Fitness Franchises You Can Buy\n\nZhang's final piece of advice applies to anyone starting or running a business: \u201cWe are always in control over our own destiny. The one thing that we can control is what we do. Even though the economy might be a little on the downward trend, there are still people out there looking for things. There are 330 million people in the United States, which means a lot of potential clients.\u201d", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353789", "author": ["Chinwe Onyeagoro"]}, {"title": "Ellen, Just Apologize Already", "text": "July 30, 2020 3 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nBy now you're probably familiar with the Ellen DeGeneres controversy.\n\nIn case you\u2019re not, here\u2019s a quick recap. According to some reports, at least one current and as many as 10 former members of her popular talk show's staff say that they were victims of \"bullying and racism.\" During the pandemic, the show's production company was accused of underpaying certain staffers. Even before that, rumors were circulating that the comedian was \"notoriously one of the meanest people alive.\"\n\nTrue? Not true? Unfair? It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s 2020!\n\nThe finger-pointing has reached such a level that the show's parent company, WarnerMedia, has launched an internal investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, many senior executives associated with the show are denying any wrongdoing. \u201cOver the course of nearly two decades, 3,000 episodes and employing over 1,000 staff members, we have strived to create an open, safe and inclusive work environment, the show's executive producers said in a joint statement. \"We are truly heartbroken and sorry to learn that even one person in our production family has had a negative experience. It\u2019s not who we are and not who we strive to be, and not the mission Ellen has set for us.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is 2020 The Worst Year Ever?\n\nRight now, the problem isn't about the alleged mistreatment of employees. The problem is all about Ellen DeGeneres. Sure, she may be just the host of the show, but she's the show. Her name's on the title. She has equity in the production. She's the business owner and the face of the brand. So where is she? Why hasn't she said anything publicly about this? Should she? Would you?\n\nShe should. Pay attention, business owners.\n\nEllen needs to make a public apology. She should say how serious the matter is and that she stands fully behind the investigation. She should also state that if any wrongdoing has been found, actions will be taken. She should also publicly state that she was unaware of any wrongdoing (assuming this is the case) but takes full responsibility as the owner of the show. She should do this in a video message, not in writing, because video can better convey her sentiment. There\u2019ll be a media tidal wave that she will have to endure. And then the wave will pass.\n\nIn this day and age, where people and brands get tried and convicted in the court of public opinion well before they reach the court of public law, there is only one proven strategy for companies \u2014 big and small \u2014 to fix a public-relations problem. It\u2019s an apology.\n\nAirlines do it. Hospitals do it. Automakers do it. Retailers do it. Even Kanye did it. It doesn\u2019t matter what the circumstances were. In 2020, people don\u2019t really care about the facts. We\u2019ve learned that facts can be manipulated to meet just about any point of view. The public simply wants to perceive their business leaders and role models as human, and there\u2019s nothing more human than messing up, and then apologizing for it. As for the financial repercussions, we\u2019ll let the insurance companies deal with that.\n\nRelated: Why Did Milton Berle Get Banned From 'SNL'?\n\nSo Ellen: Apologize.

Businesses have closed en masse, gutting certain industries and leaving millions of Americans without jobs. More than 40 million people \u2014 over a quarter of the work force \u2014 have filed unemployment claims since March.\n\nAs we face these scary prospects and the long, unknown financial road ahead of us, many people reflect on the most recent major economic downturn, the Great Recession of more than a decade ago. Although the Recession officially spanned December 2007 to June 2009, it took several more years for employment and the economy to stabilize to previous levels. It marked the largest economic crisis of our lifetime.\n\nMany people are familiar with the quote, \u201cThose who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\" Regardless of what the future holds, it is important for us to look at the business successes and failures from the most recent financial crisis and learn from that challenging time. Here are five lessons we learned from the Recession that are still true in 2020:\n\n1. Diversify your customer base.\n\nOne of the most common recommendations from financial planners to people managing the stock market is to have a diversified portfolio of investments. That is, to have a mix of investments in different areas and yields, which limits the potential for financial distress that comes from a single failed asset or risk. That is also true for businesses and their customer bases.\n\nIf a company has only one or two segments of customers, regardless of how successful it may be at the time, that can be a risky venture. It is best to have diversified income streams and establish multiple industries and types of customers that can be serviced. That way, the business will continue to exist if any of them go away.\n\n2. Strengthen your operating systems.\n\nOne of the key factors for businesses that survived the recession is that they had a strong operating system. This is not just from the franchisor, but having franchisees who implement the system in an effective way. These are the people who understand how the numbers work and how to run the business in an efficient way.\n\nThis is why franchisees with strong operating systems survive downturns while weaker franchisees or mom-and-pop businesses often do not. It is not just about having the system in place, but people with a good knowledge of the system who can effectively implement it.\n\n3. Cash is king.\n\nIt is fine to use debt to get into a business and it can be a common practice. However, it is important to preserve cash and reduce debt as soon as possible. Too much leverage in an economic downturn is a problem.\n\nThe people who were successful during the recession were those who were not overly leveraged. When a business owner makes money, one of the things they will want to do is to reduce their debt load as quickly and effectively as possible.\n\n4. Always be prepared.\n\nWe don\u2019t know many things about the future, but we can predict it will be different than the present. Those who went through the recession ten years ago and may be struggling now should find solace in knowing the situation will eventually improve. Meanwhile, some people who felt business couldn\u2019t be better in 2006 may have been upended just a few years later. The key is never to get complacent and fail to think about the future.\n\nBusiness owners should be prepared for what is coming next, even if they don\u2019t know what that will be. To a certain extent, they need to be worried about it so they do not become comfortable where they are. Like a good chess player, they should anticipate a move a step or two ahead of time. It is important to have a contingency plan and be flexible in how to respond.\n\nA great example of how to anticipate and react to change can be seen in the book Who Moved My Cheese by Spencer Johnson. The story follows the journey of four characters in search of their favorite food in a twisted maze. It is a metaphor about the ongoing search for what we want in life and the many changes we will face along the way. The main message is that change is inevitable and that we must learn to accept it, adapt to it and embrace it.\n\n5. Seize the opportunity.\n\nDuring difficult times, whether it was a decade ago or in the present day, I have seen people panic and think the sky is falling. This is often the mindset of the weaker players, and they ultimately don\u2019t survive.\n\nContrast that to others who look at the situation as one of opportunity. This becomes a time of less competition and a greater chance to consolidate ownership in a marketplace. There are new advantages, such as cheaper real estate and more available employees that were not possible just six months ago. You will see larger, stronger franchisees buyout out the weaker ones and positioning themselves for greater success in the future.\n\nWarren Buffett said, \u201cSomeone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.\u201d This is the time where people start planting trees. There are currently some available opportunities and over time those trees grow. They may not immediately enjoy the fruits of their labor, but at a certain point in the future, they will be sitting in the shade.\n\nThere are many valuable lessons we learned ten years ago. It is important to remember these examples as we move forward in the current situation.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/351647", "author": ["Rick Bisio"]}, {"title": "KFC to 3D Print Chicken Using Lab-Grown 'Meat of the Future'", "text": "July 20, 2020 3 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on PC Mag\n\n\n\nNobody does chicken\u2014or food innovation\u2014like . The chain has partnered with 3D Bioprinting Solutions in Russia to develop the world's first laboratory-produced chicken nuggets.\n\nInspired by the growing demand for animal alternatives, KFC wants to craft the \"meat of the future.\" The project, according to a press release, aims to forge something \"as close as possible in both taste and appearance\" to the restaurant's original product, while remaining environmentally friendly.\n\n\"Our experiment in testing 3D bioprinting technology to create chicken products can also help address several looming global problems,\" Raisa Polyakova, general manager of KFC Russia, said in a statement. \"We are glad to contribute to its development and are working to make it available to thousands of people in Russia and, if possible, around the world.\"\n\nA final product should be ready for testing this fall in Moscow, where folks are working on additive bioprinting technology that uses chicken cells and plant material to reproduce the taste and texture of meat, \"almost\" without involving animals.

Would clarity and persuasion help you attract more clients, investors, mentors and sales? To maximize success in conversation, ensure you are following Grice\u2019s maxims.\n\nTwentieth-century British philosopher Paul Grice shifted the way we think about semantics and language. His maxims for conversation are part of his work on the cooperative principle, which states that when people engage with one another there are unspoken assumptions around how the conversation will unfold. Research tells us that we grasp the nuances of Grice\u2019s maxims from an early age; a 2015 study found that children as young as six years old could distinguish the presence or absence of all of the maxims when listening to someone speak.\n\nTranslation: When decision-makers listen to you, they are already filtering your words through these four maxims, and if you step out-of-bounds on one or more of them, you\u2019ll have a hard time winning over your listener. Clarity is critical, particularly in high-stakes conversations like an investor pitch, and you don\u2019t want all your hard work to go down the drain because your vision is too difficult to follow when you talk about it.\n\nRelated: 5 Mistakes Entrepreneurs Make When Pitching Their Ideas to Investors\n\nAs a ghostwriter and copywriter who teaches entrepreneurs to write faster, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how following a framework can multiply an entrepreneur\u2019s financial results. Let\u2019s dig into each of Grice\u2019s four maxims in more detail and learn how you can use them to capture anyone\u2019s attention on command.\n\n1. Say what is needed and nothing more\n\nThe maxim of quantity states that excess information will ultimately clutter your story or position. Ever check out of a conversation because the person talking keeps going off on tangents? Gatekeepers will do the same to you if you overstuff them with detail; give me whatever context I need to really understand the situation and nothing more.\n\nThis is why you should be sharpening your elevator pitch all the time. A pitch forces you to blend storytelling with value and land your point in a succinct way. In my work assisting entrepreneurs with messaging, the elevator pitch is often the most challenging type of communication for a professional because it requires restraint and precision.\n\nA good rule of thumb for editing is to ask yourself \u201cSo what?\u201d at the end of each sentence or story detail. If your language doesn\u2019t actually propel your message forward, leave it out.\n\nRelated: 13 Tips on How to Deliver a Pitch Investors Simply Can't Turn Down\n\n2. Back up what you say\n\nIf your listener has to spend precious moments wondering whether the words you speak are true, their attention is being diverted from your message. Grice\u2019s maxim of quality has two components: Tell the truth, and back up what you say with evidence, preferably scientific in nature.\n\nIn a world of misinformation and content overload, science, statistics and other proven examples can help you reinforce a position. But as data editor Mona Chalabi mentioned in a 2018 NPR interview, listeners can actually feel alienated by statistics if they don\u2019t have sufficient context.\n\nAccording to this maxim, the natural disposition of a listener is to corroborate your argument in some way; anticipate this skepticism and you\u2019ll do a better job holding someone\u2019s rapt attention.\n\nRelated: Avoid These 7 Mistakes When Pitching Your Business\n\n3. Keep it relevant\n\nGary Vaynerchuk points out that while \u201ccontent is king,\u201d context is God. It\u2019s true; you can barrage your listener with anecdotes or tangents, but will sleek catchphrases and one-liners really add to your conversation or argument in the long run?\n\nGrice\u2019s maxim of relevance states that the most potent pitches, speeches and arguments are those whose subject matter is highly relevant. Companies have already picked up on these consumer semantics and adjusted accordingly, which is why customization was the No. 1 marketing trend for the second year in a row this year. (And what could be more relevant to someone than having a product with their own name on it? This is what made Coca-Cola\u2019s recent customization campaign wildly successful.)\n\nRelated: 10 Questions to Answer Before Pitching Investors\n\n4. Stay organized as you speak\n\nGrice\u2019s final maxim asks us to \u201cbe perspicuous,\u201d which means to be clear and easy to understand. This maxim refers more to your actual word choices; the more muddled your language, the harder it becomes to follow you.\n\nRun your next personal anecdote through these four sub-maxims to ensure you\u2019ll be memorable:\n\nAvoid obscure expressions. A fancy vocabulary might make you more descriptive and feel smarter, but flowery language actually sets you back when it comes to keeping someone\u2019s attention. Also keep industry jargon to a minimum.\n\nAvoid ambiguity. Who is your target audience? Tailor your conversational details to whomever is listening. The riches are in the niches.\n\nKeep it brief. Grice refers to this sub-maxim as prolixity, which is a fancy way to remind you to keep it short and to the point. Details create vividness, but if there\u2019s a way to deliver all the information needed in fewer total words, err on the side of brevity.\n\nStay orderly. When I help entrepreneurs write faster, we spend a lot of time focusing on outlines in order to work out logic and flow. The same applies for speaking. As soon as your listener\u2019s brain has to overthink or work harder, their emotional brain gets overtaken by other parts of the brain responsible for information processing. We want to keep listeners in their emotional brain for as long as possible, because people act and buy on emotion. Flow and order actually create more emotion for your listeners, not less.\n\nThe good news is that most people are wired to listen and filter for these maxims automatically. Stay in bounds, keep your message clear and to the point, and you\u2019ll have everything you need to captivate listeners the next time you have an important audience.\n\nRelated: The Fine Art of Client Pitching", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353250", "author": ["Nick Wolny"]}, {"title": "How to Craft An Elevator Pitch That Gives People Chills in Under 20 Seconds", "text": "July 2, 2020 12 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou are more than likely familiar with Entrepreneur\u2019s popular show \"Elevator Pitch,\" in which pitch their company to a board of investors during a 60-second elevator ride. If the investors like the pitch, the elevator doors open and the entrepreneur is invited into the board room to potentially make a deal.\n\nThis show\u2019s premise is of course inspired by concept that people in business have embraced for decades now: that a truly good idea can be summed up in the span of an elevator ride.\n\nBut this poses a significant dilemma. As an entrepreneur, you\u2019ve likely been toiling away at your idea for some time, possibly even years. How are you supposed to cram all of the value you\u2019ve created in so little time? And if you\u2019re making a pitch in order to attract investments, how can you describe your work in a compelling way, while demonstrating viability in the marketplace, while asking for capital?\n\nYou may be surprised to find out that there is a way you can craft your elevator pitch to not only create greater interest in your product or service, but actually give people chills in under twenty seconds.\n\nRelated: Here's What It's Like to Be on 'Elevator Pitch'\n\nHow people usually do elevator pitches\n\nAmong those who put thought into their elevator pitches, there tends to be two basic formulas:\n\nFormula A: Introduce oneself and the name of the company, then describe the product or service in the context of the customer or industry\u2019s pain point. Then, at the end, make the ask.\n\nFormula B: Identify the pain point before introducing oneself and the name of the company. Then describe the product or service, followed by the ask.\n\nWhile I\u2019m adamant that the only hard and fast rule of communication is that there are no hard and fast rules, I favor Formula B. People are most likely to embrace a solution when it\u2019s provided within the context of a problem they care about solving. By starting with a pain point, the entrepreneur is speaking to what an uninformed audience cares about right away thus making sure that the first thing their audience hears has intrinsic value to them. This helps the audience become immediately invested in solving the problem, which helps the entrepreneur to build some momentum.\n\nWhat further helps with this momentum is identifying a hole in the marketplace. Sometimes this hole is defined by a new need as dictated by circumstance (e.g. the invention and commercialization of the Internet led to a sudden need for accessing it), while other times it\u2019s defined by the inadequacy of existing solutions (e.g. introducing broadband Internet connectivity as a superior alternative to dial-up). Still other times the hole is defined by a problem that the audience doesn\u2019t actually know they have (e.g. how to access the Internet without wires when the marketplace was introduced to Wi-Fi).\n\nWhat all of these different holes have in common, however, is that they are highlighting the typical solutions that don\u2019t work \u2014 or that don\u2019t work as well. This helps the entrepreneur to build momentum because it highlights why the pain point is as powerful as it is \u2014 why it\u2019s seemingly so hard to make that pain go away.\n\nHowever, there is one ingredient that nearly every entrepreneur overlooks. It can redefine not only elevator pitches, but presentations, speeches, webinars, articles, and even books.\n\nAnd this ingredient can make your captive audience in that elevator get chills in twenty seconds or less.\n\nRelated: Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch Season 4 Episode 1: 'You Attacked Me!'\n\nAn example from an unlikely source\n\nYou may remember the 2011 film Moneyball, starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Based on a true story, Pitt plays the general manager of the Oakland Athletics in 2002. His and Hill\u2019s characters implement a fundamentally different approach to building a Major League Baseball team, and eventually win twenty games in a row, the most consecutive wins in the American League at that time. What is perhaps most significant about their season, though, is how they tied the New York Yankees for the most wins in the American League with a roster that cost a small fraction of the New York roster.\n\nToward the beginning of the film, Hill gives a little speech to Pitt that can be considered an elevator pitch of sorts \u2014 he has a short amount of time to capture Pitt's attention.\n\nHill explains to Pitt that there is an \u201cepidemic failure\u201d in how the leaders in most Major League teams manage their teams. He explains that by filling their rosters with expensive star players, they are fundamentally misunderstanding what it takes to have a winning ball club.\n\nWhere the conversation becomes interesting, though, is that he then describes this flawed approach as baseball clubs\u2019 desire to buy players. He states that the point shouldn\u2019t be to buy players, the point should be to buy wins. And to get wins one needs to get runs.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t take a half-hour, an hour, or even longer to explain a complex system of economics and baseball so as to make sure that Pitt\u2019s character is as informed about this approach as possible.\n\nInstead, he distills the approach down to a single nugget of truth:\n\nBaseball teams will win not when they buy players, but when they buy runs.\n\nThis distilled, essential truth is what I call a \u201csilver bullet\u201d \u2014 a statement that conveys the whole of a solution, idea, or innovation in a single, power-packed sentence.\n\nSilver bullets throughout history\n\nNotably, silver bullets have shown up throughout history for thousands of years. Arguably, the most memorable passage in Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War is line 18 of the first chapter: \u201cAll of warfare is deception.\u201d If you were to look up Aristotle on sites like Brainy Quote or Good Reads, you will notice that a large portion of his most famous quotes are silver bullets. This includes quotes such as \u201cThe aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but rather their inward significance.\u201d\n\nWe can cite modern examples as well. Some of the most highlighted passages in Kindle editions of non-fiction books are silver bullets. This includes what author Ed Catmull writes in his New York Times bestselling book Creativity Inc.: \u201cGetting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the ideas right\u201d which as of this writing has over 7,600 highlights. In his wildly successful book Sapiens, author Yuval Noah Harari writes that \u201clarge numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths,\u201d a silver bullet that as of this writing has over 29,000 highlights.\n\nFurther still, silver bullets show up in the most popular TED and TEDx talks. TED speaker Dan Pink once gave a talk on \u201cThe puzzle of motivation,\u201d and as of this writing has nearly 26 million views. His silver bullet states that \u201cThe secret to high performance isn\u2019t rewards and punishments but that unseen intrinsic drive\u2026the drive to do things cause they matter.\u201d And Simon Sinek\u2019s famous TEDx talk \u201cHow great leaders inspire action\u201d as of this writing has over 50 million views and prominently features the silver bullet that \u201cpeople don\u2019t buy what you do they buy why you do it.\u201d\n\nBut what is it that makes a silver bullet what it is? What each of these examples as well as every other one all have in common is that they are each a cause-and-effect sentence: when we take this action, we get this outcome.\n\nWhen we buy runs, we win the game.\n\nWhen we deceive our opponent, we win the war.\n\nWhen we get the team right, we get the ideas right.\n\nWhen we focus on why, people buy.\n\nThis simple device has the impact it has \u2014 it is remembered, highlighted, and emphasized \u2014 because it does a very important thing.\n\nIt empowers the audience without any other context.\n\nIt empowers them to suddenly believe in a different possibility.\n\nWhen someone is suddenly empowered in a way that they weren\u2019t a moment ago, they have an ah-ha moment.\n\nAnd when someone suddenly has a particularly powerful ah-ha moment, they get chills.\n\nThe silver bullet and the elevator pitch\n\nThis technique has significant bearing on an elevator pitch, in that it explains to one\u2019s audience why they\u2019re getting the results that they are. They may have succeeded in attracting customers, clients, or followers, but this silver bullet delivers the secret sauce. It explains why that success is there in the first place, and why further success can be scaled.\n\nHow can one craft the 20 seconds that will potentially give their listener chills? What many people who learn of this silver bullet concept believe at first is that the more prominent they make their silver bullet the more powerful it will be. In this way, they treat it like a tag line.\n\nBut tag lines and silver bullets are two different devices. Tag lines are essentially a promise that brands make so as to attract others as part of a first impression \u2014 as conveyed on a product\u2019s package, for example.\n\nA silver bullet, however, is the recipe that makes that promise possible. It\u2019s the secret sauce that makes the solution as valuable as it is, and as established earlier in this article people are most likely to embrace a solution when it\u2019s provided within the context of a problem they care about solving.\n\nGiven this importance of context, I recommend the first 20 seconds of an elevator pitch be as follows:\n\nIdentify the problem the audience wants to solve, their pain point. Identify typical solutions, those that leave a hole in the marketplace. Provide the silver bullet, the reason why this new solution will work when other ones have not.\n\nThen, after creating this flow, the entrepreneur can present their product or service, describe its features and benefits, identify its proof of concept in the marketplace, and, if it\u2019s a formal pitch to investors, whatever the ask may be.\n\nAn elevator pitch for a famous brand\n\nLet\u2019s make TikTok into a hypothetical example so as to apply this structure to something tangible. Imagine that you are an executive looking to pitch the platform before its meteoric rise to having 800 million users by the end of 2019. You wish to convince would-be investors, stakeholders, or partners of its potential distinction in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cHow would this be different from Vine?\u201d a wary listener might ask. Vine\u2019s service, after all, had been discontinued only a couple of years before TikTok was merged with Musical.ly to become the juggernaut we know today. But with this structure, the speaker might open their elevator pitch as follows:\n\nWith so many streams of content available at any given moment, social media apps are struggling to keep users engaged for extended periods of time (the problem). Other platforms optimize their search algorithms so as to match user intent with content in as precise and aligned a way as possible (typical solutions). But the fewer decisions users must make, the more likely they are to engage (the silver bullet).\n\nThe pitch would then go on to explain the nature of the \u201cfor you\u201d algorithm utilized by TikTok, which curates the users experience thus eliminating decision-making as a barrier to further engagement.\n\nThough there would be more to learn to go into business together, this simply expressed idea would plant a seed as to how to actually increase average user engagement.\n\nAnd if this pitch were to happen after having reached a proof of concept, the speaker would be able to cite the extensive period of time any given user stays on the platform, which for many current users is nearly an hour.\n\nThe importance of a single ah-ha moment\n\nThe most effective elevator pitches inspire the belief that growth is possible. And many pitches are effective simply because the speaker is able to boast clear indicators of this possibility. They\u2019re able to address a relatable hole in the marketplace and a proof of concept that demonstrates an ability to fill that hole.\n\nBut a silver bullet empowers without context. It inspires that ah-ha moment, which in turn inspires chills.\n\nIn our fast-paced, cluttered, noisy world, this kind of visceral response is becoming rarer and rarer. We\u2019re numb to so much of what we consume. Therefore, when you inspire this kind of visceral experience in so little time, you will create an undeniable connection between your audience and your content. You will inspire not only deals but views of talks, highlighted passages in ebooks, and other demonstrations of empowerment.\n\nWith this empowerment, the user won\u2019t just have a connection to your content, they will have a connection to you as the person who created it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you go from being an entrepreneur to being the face of a movement.\n\nRelated: Hold That Door! 7 Rules for an Elevator Pitch.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/352514", "author": ["Neil Gordon"]}, {"title": "How to Launch Your Product Without Sinking Your Savings", "text": "February 13, 2020 4 min read\n\nIn this ongoing series, we are sharing advice, tips and insights from real entrepreneurs who are out there doing business battle on a daily basis. (Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.)\n\nWho are you and what\u2019s your business?\n\nWe are Bill and Sonia Massey, President and CMO of TimeAway LLC, a consulting company specializing in product development. Our mission is to assist our customers with bringing their ideas or concepts to reality without overhauling their purse. We produce practical products at a reasonable price like our award-winning flagship product The Restroom Kit\u00ae.\n\nWhat inspired you to create this business?\n\nBefore 2008 like many entrepreneurs Sonia and I participated in the booming real estate market until it folded. After the collapse, we researched many opportunities before deciding to start another business of our own. Essentially, we wanted to be involved in a recession-proof business. We knew many creative people needed assistance in developing their idea the same as we did. Having gone through the struggle developing The Restroom Kit, TimeAway was a natural progression for us.\n\nRelated: This Solar-Powered Electric Bike Aims to Improve Your Commute and Fitness\n\nWhat was your aha moment?\n\nWe've had many aha moments bringing TimeAway and The Restroom Kit together. Initially, The Restroom Kit was a product developed for family outings and vacations with the kids. While on a bus trip my younger sister sold one of my prototype toilet seat covers to a fellow passenger, which was totally unexpected. With that, we researched the travel and health industries, spoke with a couple of mentors then decided to move forward with developing our flagship product The Restroom Kit.\n\nWhat advice would you give entrepreneurs looking for funding?\n\nThe advice we would give to entrepreneurs would be to look to family and friends first. Our initial attempt at seeking funds was via crowdfunding. We didn\u2019t have much success because of a minimal following. We did find success in pitching our friends and family. Anyone who\u2019s investing in you wants to know that you\u2019re all in before they invest. They are investing in you initially; your product hasn\u2019t done anything special yet.\n\nWhen preparing to pitch your product confidence is one of the most important assets you have. No one knows your product or service as well as you do. Some key points to remember, let your audience know who you are (introduce the company), what does the product or service do, why should they invest, what industry will you affect and what are some statistical facts about the industry?\n\nHow did it feel the first day you opened for business?\n\nOur first day of business was nerve-racking and exciting at the same time. Although we\u2019re an 85% online business, waiting to receive that initial order was intense, but during our prelaunch, we had one customer purchase over 2000 units of The Restroom Kit. That let us know we had something special. The consulting wing of the business took a little longer to pick up, but it did.\n\nWhat was your toughest challenge and how did you overcome it?\n\nThe toughest challenge was finding a reasonable manufacturer. We negotiated with companies that made promises they couldn\u2019t deliver. We\u2019d agree on deliverables templates, prototypes or samples which they overcharge and under-delivered. We overcame those challenges by doing our due diligence deeper research; asking the right questions; hiring companies that we could visit frequently.\n\nIs there a particular quote or saying that you use as personal motivation? What is it and explain how it inspires you\n\nSonia: \"Keep going through your nos because they will get you to your yesses quicker.\" This inspires me because every customer I received a NO from is going to bring me closer to the Yes customers.\n\nBill: \"Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. It was built every day.\"", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/346308", "author": ["Entrepreneur Staff"]}, {"title": "Here's How I Started the Business That Appeared on 'Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch'", "text": "January 17, 2020 6 min read\n\nEntrepreneur Elevator Pitch invites ambitious entrepreneurs to step into the Entrepreneur Elevator, then gives them just 60 seconds to pique the interest of a group of judges. It\u2019s a high-pressure, fast-paced environment in which startup founders need to race against the clock while maintaining their composure to make a clear, deliberate pitch that covers at least three essential components:\n\nDefining the company Making the request Specifying what the investment money will be used for\n\nThe investors watch the pitch via a video livestream while the elevator ascends to the boardroom floor. Once the 60 seconds are up, the judges vote on whether to open the doors or send the founder back down and pass on investing.\n\nThe fifth season of Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch offers a dynamic change in the show's format. Before, our four judges needed unanimous agreement to make an offer to the pitching entrepreneurs \u2060\u2014 including three out of four \"yes\" votes just to open the elevator doors. Now, it only takes one investor to open the doors and one judge to make an offer. The panel of four can then choose whether they want to collaborate or compete against one another.\n\nEpisode 9 featured Beth Vasquez, the founder of Recess & Results, who was kind enough to detail her experience on the show below.\n\nEntrepreneur: What is your company's elevator pitch?\n\nVasquez: Recess & Results is entertaining exercise for kids, and a praiseworthy paycheck for people with passions for faith, family and fitness.\n\nWe are the only faith-based kids fitness program and turn-key business opportunity on the market. Our virtual platform houses training modules, lesson plans and program guides, and essential business resources that transform our partners into confident, purpose-driven entrepreneurs and kid and family fitness experts.\n\nIndividuals with passions for faith, family and fitness partner with us for a low, one-time investment of just $249 and small recurring monthly partnership fee of $49. They complete the self-paced training online via our platform, and can be ready to launch their own Recess business in their community in as little as one week.\n\nThe demand for children\u2019s activities have skyrocketed, making the industry one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy.\n\n46 percent of parents spend more than $1,000 per year on their child\u2019s activities,\n\nof parents spend more than $1,000 per year on their child\u2019s activities, 81 percent of parents believe that the amount of money they spend on their child\u2019s extracurricular activities is in direct correlation with their development, thus parents spend on children\u2019s activities regardless of financial difficulty making it a recession proof business.\n\nKids are unhealthier and unhappier than ever before. As obesity, anxiety, depression, rise, parents are desperately seeking ways to build healthy habits, confidence and character in kids in a way that is fun for them.\n\nRecess & Results provides a unique, Christ-centered option for increasing your income on your own terms. Whether working part-time, full-time, or sometimes, not only can you earn a wage that matches your worth, you will grow personally and professionally while serving God alongside a family of believers on a mission to \u201csave the world, one recess at a time\u201d.\n\nWhy did you choose to start this business?\n\nWorking in both the fitness industry, and on the corporate side of the mid-level marketing (MLM) industry, I noticed an obvious demand for kids fitness programs and side-hustle opportunities and the lack of faith-based options in both areas. As a Christian mom, I intentionally look for opportunities to grow my faith and keep my family healthy and happy. As a career woman I felt the stigma of discussing faith at work and felt the pressure to keep career as the No. 1 priority. My priorities of faith, family and fitness (in that order) didn\u2019t fit corporate America and I knew I couldn\u2019t be alone. RR was the answer for me and from my work in the MLM industry, I knew I could turn it into an opportunity for others as well. The programs Recess & Results offer sell themselves, making it easy for our partners to be successful.\n\nHow was your experience in the elevator during Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch?\n\nThe overall experience was life-changing and a turning point for me in business. Lasting relationships were built that day, and my faith in God's plan for my life through this business was strengthened. A mindset shift occurred as a result of this experience and the conversations I was blessed to have that allowed me to 4x my business growth in the month that followed.\n\nWere you more or less nervous than you expected?\n\n\"Nervous\" I can handle, and I believe a little nervousness is a good thing! However, I was definitely more emotional than expected!\n\nAny surprises?\n\nThe timer counting down in my face surprised me. I practiced my pitch for time, but never staring at a countdown. But more than that, the genuineness of everyone on the crew and from the executive at Entrepreneur surprised me in the most amazing way. The authentic desire to help us be successful beyond just the filming of the show (and even after I didn\u2019t get off the elevator) was unexpected but immensely appreciated.\n\nIf you could do it over again, what would you change?\n\nI have zero regrets! I wouldn\u2019t change this experience because I needed everything to happen as it did to teach me the valuable lessons I learned. That said, if I were to come back to the show for a second time, I would restructure my pitch to paint a better picture of the industry landscape and trajectory, and talk more about the proprietary resources we offer our owners to ensure their success with their new Recess & Results business. I would also practice my pitch with distractions all around me to enhance focus.\n\nWhat did you learn from this experience that you will bring to your next pitch meeting?\n\nWhere do I start? I learned mental resilience, business strategy, gained focus and clarity in what a good pitch is made up of, and was also reminded that there is a purpose for every step in the journey. I did not walk away with a deal from the investors, but the personal, professional, and spiritual development was worth far more. God showed up so many times through this process and His presence was undeniable. I can walk into the next pitch meeting knowing that when I come prepared and do my best for God, He is there with me doing the rest, and I trust the outcome is in His hands.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/344054", "author": ["Entrepreneur Staff"]}, {"title": "7 Ways to Avoid the No.1 Virtual Sales Meeting Mistake", "text": "July 29, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t log on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t my video working?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one else is in the meeting room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see your screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe video conference program won\u2019t download on my device.\u201d\n\nIn a new study on virtual selling, 89 percent of buyers report somewhat frequently experiencing some sort of technical problem in virtual sales meetings. And 30 percent report they experience these problems frequently.\n\nThat means the virtual sales meetings they attend commonly have tech issues. And if your meeting is one with problems, your chances of success aren\u2019t good. Ninety-one percent of buyers say that effective use of technology when leading a virtual sales meeting highly or moderately influences their ultimate purchase decision.\n\nBottom line: avoid virtual selling technology problems.\n\nHere are seven ways you can avoid common virtual sales meeting technology mistakes\n\n1. Prepare meeting attendees in advance with clear instructions\n\nSet the technology expectations in advance and communicate them with all meeting attendees.\n\nWill you be on video? If you\u2019re selling, the answer should be yes. Let all participants know your webcam will be on for the call and provide instructions for how to they can turn theirs on. A simple screenshot here can go a long way.\n\nDo they need to download the meeting platform program? If so, provide a link and let them know how to get the program and test ahead of time.\n\nMake the instructions for how to enter the meeting clear. Provide a clickable meeting link and one-touch mobile dial-in to make it easy for participants to quickly get in the meeting. (If you\u2019re ever joined a conference call from your mobile phone, you know how helpful a one-touch dial-in is.)\n\n2. Run a tech check\n\nIf you have an important meeting such as a proposal presentation or larger group meeting, ask to start early with at least one member of the buyer team to run a 10-minute tech check beforehand. You won\u2019t always get a yes, but this will help to ensure the buyers are able to login properly, any audio or video works without a glitch and your visuals come through well via screensharing.\n\nNothing is more frustrating than wasting the first 15 minutes of a meeting because someone can\u2019t login or you can\u2019t figure out how to share the correct screen of your PowerPoint presentation.\n\n3. Increase your internet speed and bandwidth\n\nRaise your virtual hand if you\u2019ve been on a video conference recently and either the other person froze, or you saw an \u2018unstable internet connection\u2019 warning.\n\nRelated: Free Webinar: How to Future-Proof Your Business\n\nMost everyone can upgrade their internet speed through their internet service provider. Get a new router. Try a direct cable to your router instead of WIFI. Close background applications, especially ones that auto-refresh. Each of these will help to enhance the experience.\n\nA seller recently told us about her bandwidth issues at her house. She just hadn\u2019t thought about upgrading because she bought \u2018fast internet,\u2019 but didn\u2019t know there were all sorts of levels of fast. She called her internet provider, upgraded her service, and invested in a new router. All good now on her end.\n\n4. Choose a reliable meeting platform\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird. I was logged in, but no one was there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see Sarah is on the call, but we can\u2019t hear you\u2026.Sarah are you there?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try logging out and logging back in.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy meeting\u2019s already in progress?!? No, it\u2019s not, I haven\u2019t started it yet!\u201d\n\nYour platform, it\u2019s reliability, ease of use and security have a significant impact on a buyer\u2019s experience with you. There are many platforms to choose from, each with their own features, security and requirements. Research and choose a proven platform for your meetings. If you have ongoing issues, it\u2019s time to investigate a new platform.\n\n5. Invest in quality audio and video\n\nMost (but not all) built-in computer cameras and microphones are low to average quality. It\u2019s well worth it to invest in high-quality external devices that produce a crisp picture and clear sound.\n\nRelated: How the Crisis is Changing Consumer Behavior and Sales\n\nUse an HD webcam. Many of them also come with high-quality built-in microphones. Consider using a headset, and a podcasting-quality mic that minimizes background noise.\n\n6. Master your platform\n\nSo many buttons! Each platform has different functionality, shortcuts and tricks. Get to know your platform. Attend to best practices. At a minimum, you should be comfortable with platform annotation tools, screensharing, video, mute and audio, chat, virtual backgrounds, sharing and playing video, and meeting recording.\n\nRegardless of your platform, there are many resources available to learn the ins and outs. Take a few hours to brush up your knowledge and try a few tools. You\u2019ll be impressed with what you learn and how you can use the technology to your advantage.\n\n7. Have a 60-second backup plan\n\nEven the best-laid plans often go awry. What will you do if your audio isn\u2019t working? If a key attendee can\u2019t get in the meeting? If participants can\u2019t view your screen? If there\u2019s a technical snafu in the middle of the meeting?\n\nPlan for the various errors and glitches that can occur. Have a standard dial-in number if computer audio isn\u2019t working. Use a reliable conference call service. (And have that number handy all the time so you don\u2019t have to search for it when you need it!) Be prepared to share documents via email if you aren\u2019t able to screenshare.\n\nAvoiding technology problems isn\u2019t going to win you the sale, but it might lose it for you. You want your comfort and tech-savviness to demonstrate your professionalism and what it\u2019s like to work with you.\n\nImpress, don\u2019t frustrate, buyers by following these seven simple tips.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/352441", "author": ["Mike Schultz"]}, {"title": "10 Must-Have Productivity and Life Hacks for WFH", "text": "July 23, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nAt the end of every working day, I turn the sign on my home office door from \u201copen\u201d to \u201cclosed,\" and then walk down the hall and go fix myself dinner.\n\nI have worked from home for nearly 15 years now.

They start to invite you to stuff during the day when you are supposed to be working.\n\nI\u2019ve met a few people that can truly live a flexible and not have set work hours, but most people who work from home need to make sure they aren\u2019t saying yes to things that eat into their work time.\n\nLive by your calendar\n\nThis ties into the last tip, but is slightly different. Schedule everything on your calendar. I use Google calendar, but you can use Apple Calendar, Outlook calendar, etc. Heck, I know a few people who still use pen and paper calendars.\n\nThe key is to block out time for whatever you have on your schedule. If you are working from 8 to 5 with an hour for lunch, put that in. If you are working out 3 times a week, put that in.\n\nLetting your calendar determine what you are doing at any particular time takes a lot of decision making off your shoulders and makes most people far more productive.\n\nEven though I'm self-employed and own my own business, I still have a boss: my calendar.\n\nGet out of your house\n\nWhen you work from home getting out of your house can often seem like just too much effort. The errands you would usually run on the way home from the office often get put off.\n\nBut getting out of your house is important for most people to keep their levels up.\n\nTake a walk. Sit on your porch with your laptop and get some sun. Do something that you enjoy outside of the four walls of your home.\n\nRelated: How to Effectively Work from Home During a Pandemic\n\nDelineate home time and work time\n\nIn the intro to this article, I talked about the sign I have on the door of my home office.

You can get an open/closed sign at the local office store. As silly as this sounds... it really works if you commit to yourself that you will not work once the sign says closed.\n\nWhen you work from home it\u2019s easy to want to look productive and to let your work time bleed into your home life. But the next thing you know you're burning the midnight oil, wondering where the day went.\n\nWorking from home, I've found I'm much more productive and happy when I have clear boundaries between work life and home life.\n\nFocus on the task at hand\n\nThis one took me a long time to master. When you work at home your environment can be much more distracting than when you work at an office. If you want to enjoy your work and not be stressed out all the time, it\u2019s important to focus on the task you are doing and then move onto something else.\n\nFocus is a skill that can be learned and it is one that is well worth learning.\n\nGet website blocking software\n\nMost people who work from home work on their computers. It\u2019s very tempting to want to quickly check Facebook, watch a YouTube video, or read a quick news story. Before you know it that quick check turns into 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or more. Of course, this doesn't help you get work done, impress your boss, or make you money.\n\nIf you are routinely drawn to browsing the web instead of working, then you should seriously consider getting one of the many website blocking programs that are on the market. There are many extensions for Chrome that work well. I personally like StayFocused for its flexibility.\n\nGet dressed for real\n\nWhile working in your PJs all day is the fantasy that many people dream about, the reality is that for most people I know, getting dressed as if you are going to work can help a great deal with being in the right frame of mind to work.\n\nI find that if I look presentable I work harder and smarter than if I\u2019m sitting around in pajamas.\n\nRelated: 10 Tips From CEOs on Working From Home Effectively and Happily\n\nTrack your time\n\nIt\u2019s VERY easy to waste time when you are working from home. One thing that really helps is using a time tracking app. I\u2019ve found that the simple act of recording the amount of time you spend on every task can help add an element of accountability to where you're spending your time and help you be far more productive.\n\nI like the Toggle chrome extension. It\u2019s easy to use and gets the job done.\n\nGet up and move\n\nSlouching over a monitor all day is terrible for your back and your body. Most people do better if they take a few minutes every few hours to take a short walk or squeeze in a quick chore around the house.\n\nIf you're using a productivity system like the Pomodoro Technique then this is automatically built into your schedule. I also have my Apple Watch remind me to stand up and take a break ten minutes before every hour.\n\nTake time for joy\n\nMake sure when you are scheduling your calendar that you include things in it that bring you joy. That might be cooking a nice dinner, doing a craft project, or visiting with the ones you love.\n\nAll work and no play is no good for anyone. Scheduling in joy will give you something to look forward to and help recharge your batteries so you can be productive when you get back to work.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the calendar is my boss; luckily my boss demands that I do things that bring me joy.\n\nWhether you've been working from home for years or, like many people, are still adjusting to working from home any of these tips can help you be more productive, create work-life boundaries when working from home, and take time to enjoy life. Try one, two, or all ten and see which ones work for you.\n\nRelated: 3 Ways Strong Leaders Can Support Work-From-Home Employees", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353573", "author": ["Brian T.

Operating remotely, companies can save money, access a bigger talent pool and look more attractive in the eyes of job seekers. But that also comes with drawbacks, including a less cohesive brand culture and more challenging communication.\n\nTo anxious entrepreneurs and traditional team leaders, operating fully remotely is a scary thought. But there are plenty of examples of companies that have thrived using a purely remote model. What is it that led them to success? And can you replicate their approach for your own business?\n\nRelated: 4 Tips for Managing Communication Among Remote, Multilingual Teams\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the most prominent examples of successful businesses that have operated fully remotely (or close to it):\n\nAutomattic\n\nOne of the most commonly cited names in the world of fully remote businesses is Automattic, better known as the parent company of Wordpress \u2014 the most popular blog and website creation tool in the world. Wordpress, which is now used by 30 percent of all websites, was created with a completely virtual workspace. So what made it so successful? Part of the answer lies with its communication philosophy. Most companies that go fully remote simply turn meetings into video conferences and rely more heavily on email and instant chat, but Automattic takes things a step further. It has completely re-optimized its communication systems with many different channels, including a social media-like shared blog for public communication. Additionally, Automattic keeps employees connected and talking to each other with shared activities, like coloring, chair yoga, book clubs, virtual dog parks and even an open mic night.\n\nInVision\n\nInVision is a product design and prototyping app used by more than three million designers, but what\u2019s really impressive is that the company operates with a distributed team across 25 countries. Part of what\u2019s made the company successful is its robust investment in its employees. InVision offers employees a comprehensive medical insurance package, along with gym memberships that both keep employees healthy and give them a platform to socialize. Additionally, employees can enjoy a generous salary, substantial equipment allowances and a roomy budget for travel and conferences.\n\nBuffer\n\nBuffer is a company that creates tools that make social media much easier to manage. It\u2019s also been fully remote from the very beginning. So what\u2019s the secret to its success? If there\u2019s one factor to consider more than the others, it\u2019s the business\u2019s flexibility. Employees have the option to work wherever they want, whether it\u2019s from a local caf\u00e9 or from their own home. Additionally, employees can exercise autonomy over their own projects and their own hours, allowing them to work in the ways that allow them to reap their full potential.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Aligning Your Remote Team's Goals\n\nZapier\n\nZapier makes automation software, enabling companies to automate their workflows and combine the functionality of several apps simultaneously. It\u2019s also been operating fully remotely since its launch nearly 10 years ago. One of its best qualities is its effective use of tools. Most modern remote teams already understand the need for certain tools to enable communication and collaboration across vast distances, and the power that automation can have in reducing the burden of small, menial tasks. Your choice in tools, and how you use them, plays a major role in determining your success. Zapier figured that out early and either purchased or created the best possible combination of tools for its team to use.\n\nMozilla\n\nBest known as the creator of the Firefox browser, Mozilla is a development company with an impressive talent pool and an ongoing commitment to creating great products. It\u2019s kind of cheating to put it on this list, since its workforce isn\u2019t fully remote, but more than half its workforce has been remote for much of its history. As with many of the companies on this list, there are many factors responsible for its success, but one of the most notable is its emphasis on the brand\u2019s core values, among them being transparency. Mozilla coordinates and unifies its teams by setting strict company policies and encouraging all its employees to live and thrive in the same brand culture.\n\nLearning from the best\n\nObviously, there are other factors for success we didn\u2019t discuss here. Many of these businesses are tech companies, making them better poised to operate remotely than, say, a fitness center. They also have strong business models that could have made them a success regardless of whether or not they had a .\n\nBut looking beyond these additional factors, there are many lessons an aspiring entrepreneur can learn. When you give your employees more flexibility, the tools they need to communicate effectively and unify them under the same banner, you enable them to do their best work, even when they\u2019re working outside of the conventional office.

As these tools get more sophisticated and deeper integrations become available between tools, websites, social media platforms, shopping carts, etc., the potential to segment audiences using unique behavioral data grows more robust.\n\nWhile most marketers focus on active consumer behaviors like web-page visits, lead-magnet requests and opt-in form submissions, there's a significant opportunity for businesses to connect with audiences by tracking more passive or inactive behavior. Here are five examples of common consumer inaction that you can develop email-marketing strategies around to generate positive results.\n\nRead This: Ultimate Guide to Email Marketing for Business | Amazon | Barnes & Noble | Apple Books | IndieBound\n\n1. No purchase made.\n\nIf someone takes the time to show interest in your product but doesn\u2019t buy, you need to make another effort to close the sale. By setting up an automated email-message campaign triggered to send when someone displays a behavior that shows they\u2019re interested in your product but doesn\u2019t buy, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to nurture them and motivate them to take action and complete the desired behavior.\n\n2. No email opens.\n\nAny time a person on your email-marketing list opts not to open your messages, it could negatively affect overall deliverability. That's why it\u2019s important to set up automated email campaigns that cleanse your list on an ongoing basis.For example, you could set up a campaign to remove all contacts who haven\u2019t opened a message in the past three-to-six months. In addition to cleaning your email list based on an absent behavior (i.e. opening your messages), you can also use the data to refine your psychographic segmentation strategies. If a recipient opens all of your messages except those about a specific service, you can use that data to deliver more relevant messages in the future.\n\nRelated: Know This About Modern Consumer Behavior or Forget Reaching Your Revenue Goals\n\n3. No email clicks.\n\nOne of the metrics marketers track as an indicator of an email campaign\u2019s success is click-through rate. But if you reverse-engineer this key performance indicator (KPI) and track when recipients don\u2019t click, you\u2019ll get even more valuable information. By focusing on who's not clicking through, you can follow up with contacts who may have missed something important and give them another chance to display the behavior you want. This metric is just one more piece to help you build consumer profiles, so you can send the most relevant messages possible to your audience and reduce their email fatigue from your brand.\n\n4. No repeat purchases.\n\nDo you have customers who never made a second purchase or haven\u2019t made a purchase in months? Email marketing is a perfect tool for win-back campaigns, but you need to track who stopped buying in order to launch one. When someone buys from you for the first time, kick off an automated email campaign within a few weeks if they haven\u2019t made a second purchase yet (or longer depending on the sales and buying cycle for your business). The message can include a special offer to motivate them to buy again. You can schedule a similar win-back message to go out to inactive customers on a quarterly basis or whatever schedule matches your business model.\n\n5. No response to follow-up sales calls.\n\nInaction can also be associated with offline behaviors, such as sales activities. If you\u2019re using an email-marketing tool that includes a customer relationship management (CRM) or sales automation platform (or your email-marketing tool integrates with a CRM or sales automation platform), then you can track sales-related behaviors and send targeted messages. For example, if a member of your company\u2019s sales team called a prospective customer who expressed interest in your product but hasn't heard back yet, they'll invariably follow up a certain number of times. But if you\u2019re closely tracking that customer's behavior, you can automatically follow up through email marketing as well. It\u2019s a great way to reinforce why your business or product is the right choice and remind the prospect why they were interested in the first place.\n\nEmail marketing is very powerful, but even more so when you create automated campaigns based on strategic segmentation.

For example, they can subscribe to smart digital platforms that allow them to access the borrower\u2019s smartphone with due consent. This effectively converts the device into a virtual collateral. Once this is done, an innovative over-the-air communication protocol can help the lender reach the borrower even when he is offline, out of cellular coverage area or unwilling to answer the calls. This eliminates the need for sending SMSes or setting up a huge call center for outreach.\n\nDigital Payments Over Cash\n\nWith significant improvement in the digital payments infrastructure, repayment can easily be facilitated using several options including UPI, credit and debit cards, net-banking, digital wallets and so on. Lenders can educate borrowers about the ease of using these options and reduce the challenges of walking up to a branch to repay or take out cash from ATMs or bank branches.\n\nApart from deploying an efficient recovery mechanism, banks also need to sensitize borrowers how paying on time may benefit them and open up more financial services and larger loans in future. This goes a long way towards ensuring a sustained cash flow for them and building a healthy financial culture in the country, as we recover from the economic ripples of COVID-19.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354071", "author": ["Neel Juriasingani"]}, {"title": "Why India should start using online Tribute services", "text": "July 31, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nPosting an obituary when a loved one passes away is an inexpressible pain. Friends and relatives of the deceased come to extend their condolences when they learn of the person\u2019s demise. Families\u2019 emotional attachment and bond with their deceased relative prompts them to pay tribute to the departed.\n\nAs now we all are aware that in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19, the government has issued orders to limit the size of public gatherings. The government\u2019s rules extend even to funerals. As a result, fewer people are attending funerals. While limiting the size of gatherings at funerals is an excellent way to prevent coronavirus from spreading, it makes it impossible for everyone who wishes, to pay their respects to the departed. Many who would like to bereave with the family and friends of someone who has passed away can\u2019t do so because of the government\u2019s orders.\n\nIn such a scenario, people can create befitting tributes online. Posting obituaries, like much else, is being reshaped by technology and is now widely accepted in India. Online obituaries help all the family and friends grieve the passing of a loved one. Such obituaries are dynamic tributes to a deceased person. By collating messages, videos, and pictures of and for the deceased, online tribute services are ensuring the bereaved family, and friends and relatives of the deceased get their closure and solace, from any corner of the world, even if they have not been able to attend the funeral.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nOne can create a profile or a personalized tribute page on the websites of tribute services for their dear ones who are no more and give information about the 'chautha', 'baithak', and other rituals. Such platforms are well integrated with email, Whatsapp, and SMS. Due to the ongoing situation, the people in India should also tilt towards online tribute services as they reassure to say goodbye to a loved one and share the memories without the need to bring people together physically in one place.\n\nMemorials Allow Everyone to Participate\n\nAs these memorials are online, they allow you to connect with a huge number of people around the world. You can communicate it with friends and family around the country or even internationally what is occurring and what happened, thus allowing everyone to participate.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Not Just Information\n\nWhen grieving, many people need to do more than just say a loved one has passed on. We have seen that on social media platforms like Facebook or Whatsapp, people just react on obituary information by just writing RIP or Om Shanti which seems merely as a formality of paying tribute. The reason has been that such platforms are not the correct place to create obituaries or tributes. The need to share their thoughts and feelings about the deceased can only be done meticulously on a proper tribute page of the deceased. Also, the tributes paid by people have limited visibility on Facebook as people do not generally scroll back too long to read older posts. A tribute page provides you with the ability to do just that. It also allows your loved ones to share thoughts about the individual all in one place and can view even the oldest posts in a click.\n\nGlobal Reach\n\nOnline memorials allow people to participate in the grieving process from anywhere across the globe and at any time, whether it's day or night. If someone is not able to attend the last ceremonies of the deceased person, he/she can still participate in the grieving process with online tribute platforms. Such public displays of grief are essential for emotional recovery after bereavement.\n\nIt\u2019s There For The Long Term\n\nAn online obituary is online forever, which means future generations can learn about their forefathers. People who never knew their grandparents could visit online obituaries to learn about the extraordinary lives their ancestors lived. When an online obituary is created, it becomes a repository of people's lives for future generations, thus helping you to grieve more reassuringly.\n\nConclusion\n\nMarking the death of someone is important, and if you cannot bring people together in one place, with online tribute, you can still celebrate life and hold a fitting memorial. An online tribute platform comes as a solace for people who wish to pay their tributes on the demise of their loved ones from far away and preserve their memories for a lifetime in a beautiful manner.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354070", "author": ["Sumit Khaitan"]}, {"title": "How to Build a Successful E-commerce Business in the Congested Lifestyle Domain", "text": "July 30, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nAny business idea is only an idea till it doesn\u2019t have a USP and for an e-commerce brand, it is the most important to understand what is the USP and how well you can use it to develop a customer base. E-commerce can be a challenging space owing to the vast variety of options to choose from and having the capability to service a large crowd.\n\nOne needs to carefully define the market in their head and focus exclusively on it. Then you need to make sure to invest time in cultivating the brand and at the end be something you are proud of. This quality and pride in your brand would reflect your customers. The strategy to penetrate into e-commerce market is firstly to identify the target group and differentiate between the customers\u2019 needs and luxury. You need to study the market space and measure the potential consumption after the differentiation is made.\n\nThe e-commerce industry is no longer a strange territory for aspiring businessmen and space is getting cluttered, especially in the lifestyle domain. But if the basics are set right and the key details are factored in right from the beginning, you will be able to make a comfortable spot for your brand without having to worry about too much competition. The core strategy while getting into e-commerce should of course be customer satisfaction and to understand when and what the market demands. It\u2019s important to keep changing and going ahead with the trend which plays an integral part to make the customers a part of our story. Never forget that your customer is a normal person and like any other normal person, your customer\u2019s needs will also evolve over time and you should be ready to cater to it. Only identifying the target demographics is not enough unless you are buying media. The fundamental aspect is to focus on research that identifies and defines the profitable target group. This is a key focus as it helps with the target segmentation in combination with the behavioural data and it provides the actionable insights for growth.\n\nIt is essential to choose the e-commerce platform as to building a website from scratch because the main focus is to sell the products and increase sales. And being personally involved in the initial stage will steer your brand exactly into the direction you want it to grow. One needs to make sure their website is easy to navigate and has a very user-friendly interface. The usage of too many jargons and technical terms make it difficult for a normal customer to understand the nature of the offerings and they often leave your site before completing a purchase. The product images have to be of high quality and real. Presenting a false image will gather new customers initially but in the long run, it will result in loss of sale and affect your brand image in a negative way. The product catalog needs to always be updated so that people know what\u2019s new and relevant information should be provided to the customers. One of the biggest factors to be avoided is \u201cDON\u2019T MAKE RETURNS OR EXCHANGE TOO TOUGH FOR THE CUSTOMERS\u201d. The reason people choose an e-commerce platform of for ease of access and a comfortable buying at their fingertips, these two experiences can never be compromised. Customer care services for an online business play an important role because the consumer has zero face-to-face contact with the brand. The customers' interaction with customer service needs to be satisfactory and leave a lasting impression to build trust and faith in the brand or service. Creating customer loyalty is not only important for a higher rate of returning customers, but it also creates an unbeatable level of word-of-mouth advertising.\n\nDigital is flourishing in our country and it holds the capacity to stand tall even in testing times. Our current situation is the best proof of digital emerging as the winner. At a time when other businesses are striving to stay afloat, industries such as e-learning, online gaming, social media, e-delivery, and OTT platforms are multiplying their profits. People are confined to their homes and are becoming heavily dependent on online services for entertainment and to meet their daily requirements. Many offline businesses these days are opting to adapt an online business model. The value of money and the lesser cost of running the business is also making it an appealing industry for investors to pump in their money. The primary difference between an online and offline store is the location and reach. While Brick and Mortar give the customer the look, feel, and touch experience whereas it restricts the reach which is one of the biggest criteria for brand growth.

And one of those key indicators is your .\n\nFor entrepreneurs, it's not just about physical fitness. Your cognitive fitness matters equally.\n\nWhen you think of cognitive fitness, think of these ten categories: attention, motor control, memory, perception, language, social and emotional functioning, planning and logic, computational skills, creativity and imagination, and motivation.\n\nIf that seems overwhelming, don't fret. You can start building a brain that is healthier, smarter, and stronger through these five practical habits.\n\n1. Eat more Omega-3s\n\nWhat protein is to your muscles and what calcium is to your bones is what Omega-3s are to your brain.\n\nThe human brain is nearly 60 percent fat. And within that, there's a large portion that consists of an Omega-3 fatty acid called Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)\u2014talk about a mouthful of a word.\n\nRelated: Brain Hacks to Boost Motivation and Beat the Work From Home Blues\n\nDHA is relevant to your personal and entrepreneurial life due to it promoting new neuron growth, which allows signals to move across neurons. In plain speak: this allows your brain to operate much more efficiently and effectively.\n\nBesides exercise and sleep, your nutrition dictates the level to which your brain will perform.\n\nImproving your nutritional regimen through the inclusion of more Omega-3s will enhance your memory, your attention-to-detail, your mood and charisma, and your ability to assimilate and implement information.\n\nTo get started, start adding foods such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, and trout to your weekly menu. If the sound of those foods makes your stomach churn or turns your nose up, invest in a high-quality fish oil supplement.\n\n2. Play chess\n\nEntrepreneurship isn't just about landing pages, funnels, and tactics. Being able to recognize trends and adapt to the current market is equally, if not, more important.\n\nWhen it comes to recognizing trends and patterns, this can further break down into pattern and object recognition. The left hemisphere of your brain deals with object recognition, while the right deals with pattern recognition.\n\nRelated: Can Binaural Beats Make Your Brain Smarter?\n\nWith that said, in a 2010 study appearing in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, researchers discovered that playing chess boosted both sides of your brain.\n\nChess also helps your brain stimulate the growth of dendrites, which are tree-like branches that conduct signals from other neuron cells into the neuron they're attached too.\n\nWith bigger and faster neurons, your ability to process information, along with your general intelligence, will rise.\n\nAnd here's some more good news: you don't need to turn into the next Bobby Fischer to reap the benefits. You can sign up for a free account at chess.com.\n\n3. Learn a new language\n\nWhether it's to help with the ever-increasing diverse business world or to integrate more in-depth into a culture on your next travels, learning a new language is beneficial.\n\nOne of the more significant benefits of learning a second language is it helping to increase the volume of your brain. This may sound strange at first, but I promise, this should be music to your ears.\n\nNot only is it an evolutionary advantage, but it's also beneficial to strengthening your \"mental muscles.\"\n\nAppearing in the October 2012 issue of NeuroImage, scientists discovered that consistently practicing a language generates higher hippocampal volume, which happens to be the cerebral structure whose main task is linked to our memory.\n\nLastly, as an entrepreneur, a large portion of your day revolves around making decisions.\n\nAnd speaking of decisions, a study by the University of Chicago appearing in the April 2012 issue of Psychological Science found that people who spoke an additional language were better able to pick up nuances and subtleties in any given situation. Individuals made decisions that were more rational-based as opposed to emotionally-based.\n\nRelated: How to Strengthen Your Brain for Success\n\nWhile a tutor or immersing yourself in a country is great, starting with any language app for as little as 15 minutes is a great way to build this habit up.\n\n4. Commit to a writing practice\n\nWhen we think of mitigating stress, the first train of thought is to seek out Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Holy Basil, and Vitamin D, amongst many others.\n\nHowever, there's something you can do right this moment to mitigate stress: start writing.\n\nYou don't need to write the next great American novel nor become the next Tolstoy or Garcia-Marquez to reap the benefits of daily writing.\n\nWriting is great for improving your critical thinking skills. But most importantly, writing (specifically, journaling) is beneficial to an entrepreneur's mental health.\n\nWhether it's your health, relationships, past trauma, or merely the emotional roller coaster of building something from scratch while navigating through a pandemic\u2014journaling is beneficial for entrepreneurs.\n\nA study appearing in the September 2005 issue of the Advances in Psychiatric Treatment found that writing about emotional, stressful, or traumatic events for 15 to 20 minutes on multiple occasions was found to improve your physical and psychological health.\n\nNo need to get fancy, use a dedicated notebook to share your thoughts on for 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n5. Learn how to dance\n\nI remember the first time I walked into a salsa class. My stomach was in knots, and my palms were getting sweaty. Luckily, I found a towel to wipe my hands before asking a girl to dance.\n\nYears later, dancing has provided numerous benefits to my personal and professional life: two of those being self-confidence and the ability to think quicker on my feet. Being quick on your feet and able to improvise is essential throughout every stage of the selling process along with general daily communicating.\n\nHowever, as you age, the typical person sees a decrease in their motor, cognitive, and perceptual abilities.

The middle class is an unforgiving place to be for aspiring millionaires. As a society, we have been raised to believe that a $70,000 salary, a house in the suburbs, a couple of cars, and two-week vacation is living comfortably. Your parents are right; this kind of life is comfortable, it\u2019s normal. After all, it\u2019s what hundreds of millions of utterly average Americans are doing, and they\u2019re perfectly happy, right?\n\nHowever comfortable an average life may be, it\u2019s certainly not freedom.\n\nComfort is commonly mistaken for freedom. Where the majority of American\u2019s go wrong is taking money advice from those stuck in the middle-class, financial comfort zone, rather than those who have built wealth. Having been raised with a middle-class mindset towards money and lifestyle, I understand how difficult it is to break free of the restrictive thoughts that keep people from their potential. Because I\u2019ve done it, I also know, step-by-step, how to break out of average and become financially free.\n\n1. Embrace sales as a way of life\n\nSelling impacts every person on this planet. Someone\u2019s ability or inability to sell, persuade and negotiate directly influences their position or status in life. There is a person in this world selling every millisecond of every day.\n\nYou need to sell yourself to get the job you want, you need to convince your boss why you should get the raise you think you deserve, you need to persuade the car salesman to give you a discount, you need to sell your crush on saying yes to dinner, and the list goes on.\n\nThere is no limit to what and how much you can sell, and what you get in return is the commission. How good or bad you are at sales determines the life you lead. When you embrace sales as a lifestyle and begin to develop your skills in the area of sales, an immediate shift will take place. You\u2019ll begin getting more of what you want more often, setting yourself up for a future of freewill.\n\n2. Become an asset\n\nYou can\u2019t get to where you\u2019ve never been by doing the things you\u2019ve always done. If you want to reach higher levels in life, you\u2019ll need to think, train, and perform at higher levels. To enhance your thinking, invest in books with quality information from credible authors. To improve your training, you must invest in proven programs and workshops created by the people who have already built the wealth you want and are who you strive to become. To enhance your performance, invest in personal coaching from these people, allowing yourself a closer look into the mindset and actions of the ultra-successful, and adopting them into your daily practice.\n\nInvest in yourself first and become your greatest asset. If the economy crashes and your bank balances go to zero, all you\u2019ll have left is yourself. When self-development is done correctly and continuously, the only resource you\u2019ll need to prosper is you.\n\n3. Expand your network\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard this a million times before: \u201cIt\u2019s not X, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d The people you know, and who know you, will have an effect on the quality of your life; even if that effect is no effect. Yes, your life is impacted when it\u2019s not being impacted. Make a list of ten people in your network, and ask yourself: Do they invest in your ideas? Can they introduce you to people who can? Are they more successful than you? Do they add to your life?\n\nRelated: How Millennials Can Reach Financial Freedom\n\nSomeone in your circle who is not adding to your life, but not necessarily subtracting, is still having an impact on the overall state of your life. Rather than investing your time and energy into people who can help you expand, it\u2019s being spent on people who play an inactive role in bettering your life and theirs. Discover who you want in your inner circle and devise a plan to meet them. When you have the right people in your corner, anything is possible.\n\n4. Save to invest\n\nIf you were raised middle-class like me, you were most likely taught to save money for a rainy day, keep funds tucked away for emergencies, or to put your money away to buy a house, car, or two-week vacation in Hawaii.\n\nThe problem with this is that once you spend the money, it\u2019s gone. The money that you saved to buy the house or car is worth less than it was the day after you spent it. The same way your house and car depreciates, your two-week vacation in Hawaii is an experience that will fade from memory over time. When it comes to savings, there is no light at the end of the tunnel; the tunnel just ends.\n\nRelated: 8 Ways to Set Yourself Up For Financial Freedom in Your 20s\n\nThe lessons I learned and applied from rich people to become rich myself was to save money to invest in appreciating, income-producing assets. Money should always come back to you. Rather than saving for the sake of saving, save your money to put it into smart investments that pay consistent returns for the rest of your life.\n\n5. Cash flow\n\nWhen you\u2019ve saved enough money to start investing, choosing where to put your money is the final step to your financially free future. Some put their money into the stock market, which in my opinion, is only a good option for two kinds of people: Those who have enough wealth to risk a lot of money, or those who have the time to constantly watch the market for fluctuations. Stocks are too volatile for my taste; too much chance, with very little monthly payout.\n\nGood money can only be made in the stock market when one has enough of three things: Knowledge (could be in the form of a fiduciary), money, and luck. Lose access to even one of these three things, and your chances of losing money increase dramatically.\n\nSome invest in houses to flip or rent out. Renting single-family homes can produce positive cash flow but having a single tenant to depend on for payment is risky. If something happens to your tenant or in your tenant's life that affects their living situation, your unit immediately becomes vacant, and you don\u2019t get paid unless you can quickly fill that vacancy. As long as the unit remains unoccupied, it depreciates.\n\nRelated: Gain Financial Freedom With Your Own Ad Agency\n\nI invest in multifamily apartment complexes. The reason I\u2019ve chosen to put my money into apartments since I was 30 is because of their consistency in producing strong cash flow, month-after-month. Even if there are a handful of vacancies or tenants who are late on their payments, monthly income is still being generated from the remaining tenants.\n\nThe consistent cash flow that multifamily assets produce increases the value of these properties over time, priming them to be sold for much more than they were purchased for, or producing substantial lifelong income and generational wealth.\n\nThere\u2019s enough wealth in the world for everyone, including you. Make the decision to become better every day than you were the day before, whether that means multiplying your income, being a better mother or father, or widening your social circle; always be improving.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/352741", "author": ["Grant Cardone"]}, {"title": "Emergence of Indian Local Grocers", "text": "July 30, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIn March, long queues were seen outside supermarkets as anxious shoppers waited to stockpile supplies. Three months on, the queues are still there; now shoppers\u2014two meters apart and with pockets full of hand sanitizers\u2014are lining up for a socially-distanced visit to stores.\n\nEmpty grocery shelves, both physical and digital, have become symbolic of how the black swan event like COVID-19 has had far-reaching impacts on communities and supply chains around the globe. Goods that once seemed abundant such as toilet papers, cleaning supplies, water, milk, meat quickly became difficult to find. In the hunt for these essentials, while adhering to stay-at-home directives, people have turned to online shopping, accelerating the adoption rate of grocery delivery services.\n\nThe unavailability of grocery delivery windows, the out-of-stock memos on major e-commerce platforms and even the cancellation of certain online orders where supply was miscalculated, were something rarely experienced before this crisis. It\u2019s driven people to stores in droves. This has grocers and e-commerce companies racing to adapt and keep people safe.\n\nPhysical retail and the supply chain that powers it are acting as extremely important stabilizing forces in society right now. When the digital and physical shelves are restocked with staple items, most notably in this environment such as toilet paper, it will signal a return to normalcy: a psychological calmer. In a webinar by Entrepreneur India, key players in retail and logistics examine the impact this public health emergency has had on the practice-related aspects and how they can prepare for the future by remodeling new business models now.\n\nRise of On-demand Grocery Delivery\u2014the Future\n\nGrocery and food retailers are responding to an unprecedented demand that strains the entire ecosystem. Customers from all demographics have shifted to digital, ushering in a new normal for food retail that may become permanent. This has created an environment poised for innovation, with a need to realign supply chains, to target on some specific problem area and not a blanket solution to all problems, redefine what parts of the food workforce are essential, and gain a deeper understanding of how to connect with loyal customers through social media. \u201cCOVID-19 has created a condition in which a lot of trials will happen, purely based on availability,\u201d says Karthik Venkateswaran, CEO and co-founder of Jumbotail.\n\nThe concept of a supermarket-on-wheels is not entirely new. \u201cBased on the demand that we have received, we are targeting the demographic that loves convenience,\u201d says Vaibhav Domkundwar, CEO and founder of Better Capital.\n\nYet retail experts wonder how new grocery alternatives like these will perform in an already saturated grocery market. Apps like UberEats, Zomato, Swiggy, Grofers, BigBasket Dunzo and Amazon Prime have made it possible to get groceries shipped straight to your door, while many restaurants have beefed up delivery services during COVID-19.\n\nAs consumers continue to stock up on essentials as well as hoard and panic-buy grocers, delivery services, and e-commerce companies are adapting at a rapid pace to meet consumer demand and deal with the unchartered territory of how to keep employees and shoppers safe from the virus while doing so.\n\nAs consumers deal with the unexpected fallout of crisis situations like COVID-19, grocers can take on the role of the responsible retailer, working with partners and local governments to provide for hard-hit consumers while building trust within local communities.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to run its course, grocers must also focus on optimizing processes and serving customers now, while planning ahead. While harder to predict, grocers should be prepared to navigate shifts in demand, supplier partnerships, and inventory management as panic buying slows down and consumers begin to return to more regular shopping patterns. \u201cGreed has done its round. Now the fear is driving opportunities for new entrants to think whether I should take from a nearby retailer versus a delivery boy coming from an unknown place,\u201d says Anand Kumar Bajaj, MD and CEO of PayNearby.\n\n\u201cCollaboration is the way forward. We are fighting for a new world order which is driven by technology. We all should join hands to solve problems for retailers or insufficiencies in trade. It can only happen if the collective consensus says yes that we need to solve the problem together. It will create a surplus because India is at an inflection point in the gross domestic product (GDP) when we cross 3000 per capita GDP dollars, the nation\u2019s consumption will start becoming less price conscious in grocery,\u201d mentions Venkateswaran.\n\nWill this crisis have long-term impact on the way people shop, or how grocers do business? The steps grocers take to optimize the supply chain have the potential to reshape how grocers interact and build relationships with customers, employees and partners now, and for years to come.\n\nSeamless customer experiences have been a priority even before the pandemic, and grocers are responding by tailoring their online platforms to meet consumers\u2019 shifting needs. They are reexamining how they list their products online, seeking to support growing digital payment volumes and approaching their in-store operations with the same critical eye. Some are even exploring how flexible delivery hours or automation could support speedier transactions. Grocers and their payment providers must not get complacent, however. They will need to be prepared to craft new innovations and implement technologies for a future in which consumers expect more flexibility in how they shop and pay. \u201cGrocery market is like a Russian winter, you have to respect it,\u201d adds Venkateswaran in light humor.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/video/354007", "author": ["Prabhjeet Bhatla"]}, {"title": "Want to Start a Side Hustle Investing in Real Estate?

With a figure like that, it\u2019s no wonder that business leaders the world over are looking to change the ways they think about innovation for good.\n\nIf you\u2019re hoping to ride the next transformational bandwagon, you\u2019ll need to know what the current discourse around innovation looks like. Here are a few good places to start.\n\n1. Consumer Interaction\n\nThe customer may always be right, but companies sure haven\u2019t been treating her like she is. COVID-19 has exposed just how flimsy some businesses' customer experiences truly are, and consumers are ready to fight back. Research from American Express has shown that one-third of customers will switch brands after just a single bad experience, meaning that it\u2019s high time businesses get their act together.\n\nThe first place to start is by simply devoting more attention and resources to the demands of your client. Jeff Wong, one of the most innovative people I follow and EY\u2019s Global chief innovation officer, encourages leaders to go from \u201c'eyes down' (when they just focus on what\u2019s in front of them) to 'eyes up' and look ahead to assess what needs to be done to meet changing demands.\u201d An \u201ceyes up\u201d attitude can be all it takes to bring your company one step closer to the people it services and boost business in the process.\n\nRelated: Why You Should Speed Up Digital Transformation During the Crisis\n\nNow more than ever, people want the opportunity to make a difference with their purchases. Nearly 90 percent of customers want businesses to be more environmentally and ethically friendly, and those customers are more than willing to turn that desire into cash.\n\nEmbracing sustainability will look markedly different for every company, but it always generates consumer hype when done correctly. Consider Burger King\u2019s adoption of the Impossible Whopper or feeding their cattle lemongrass in order to reduce methane emissions. Neither of these are huge steps for a business to take, but they\u2019re tangible and expand the company\u2019s pool of customers to include those concerned about their carbon footprint.\n\n3. A Focus on EQ\n\nWhen we think of business innovation, it can be easy to get caught up in the notion of a driven, monomaniacal entrepreneur with something to prove. While that may be true in some instances, it\u2019s an outdated picture of an increasingly diverse field that is starting to value EQ as much as it does IQ.\n\nInnovation doesn\u2019t just mean creating a slick new product; it can just as easily mean novel corporate restructuring, implementation of new workplace policies or refining recruitment tactics. Startup consultant Andrew Deen said it best when he wrote that high-EQ entrepreneurs are \u201cgood at putting themselves in someone else\u2019s shoes and seeing challenges from different perspectives \u2026 these qualities typically make them excellent, respected communicators.\u201d\n\nConsumers are tired of companies proclaiming social responsibility but failing to put their money where their mouth is. After hundreds of companies posted black squares on June 2 in solidarity with nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, backlash soon followed, claiming that this amounted to little more than performative activism. Businesses willing to go the extra mile soon separated from the rest of the pack, with firms like Apple pledging $100 million to racial equity initiviates. Whatever is coming next in business, it\u2019s going to have to make a real change if it wants to survive.\n\nRelated: Collaboration Is the New Innovation\n\n5. Virtual Living\n\nEven before the pandemic struck, the average internet user spent just shy of 7 hours a day online \u2014 an already-high number that has surely ballooned since the start of the pandemic. The digital world may be full of ways to keep yourself entertained, but as the internet starts to become a prosthetic for other aspects of life, people are starting to look for new ways to replicate in-person experiences online.\n\nWave, a digital concert-streaming platform, recently nabbed $30 million during a round of fundraising and later partnered with Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation label, paving the way for a new era of concerts that don\u2019t have to be attended to be seen. Rock-star manager Scooter Braun perhaps summed it up best when he said that \u201cthe future of the industry depends on\u201d companies like Wave, and the same is true for nearly all other industries as well.\n\nThe business world is changing before your very eyes; you just need to latch on to the right changes at the right time. Innovation is a story that\u2019s never finished, but getting involved now can ensure happy endings for your later on.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353889", "author": ["Rashan Dixon"]}, {"title": "Side Hustles for These Times", "text": "July 30, 2020 1 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nPeter Voogd describes several ideas for entrepreneurs looking to make extra money and improve their skillset.

The problem is, company accountability is hard to track and is often a catalyst for investments gone bad. A study by Harvard found that angel investors reported that only 11 percent of their portfolio yielded a positive return. This means nine out of 10 angel investments typically end poorly, with investors not having any control over the day-to-day operations of what a company does and how it spends its money.\n\nThankfully, a new crowdfunding model has emerged and just experienced its first successful launch. Dynamic Coin Offerings (DYCOs) leverage blockchain technology to add accountability to teams by holding raised funds in third-party management and offering up to 80 percent refunds to early contributors if the price of a company\u2019s token drops below the initial participation price.\n\nThe first DYCO was managed by a Prague-based company called DAO Maker that managed the crowdfunding campaign, KYC, audits and other regulatory and legal aspects. The first DYCO, Orion Protocol, saw massive interest on the platform, oversubscribing 300 percent in its private contribution round and even more in its public round.\n\nRelated: 50 Things You Need to Succeed in the Perpetually Changing World of Modern Finance\n\nInitial feedback from the startup community was overwhelmingly positive, with praise for its transparency and commitment to mutual success. To get a better feel of the model and potential drawbacks, here are three key aspects of DYCOs.\n\n1. DYCOs offer multiple levels of safeguards\n\nThe DYCO model allows participants to send in 100 percent of their tokens for up to 80 percent refunds, no matter if they previously sold tokens in the past or not. This process starts at the ninth month following the crowd sale and is tranched through the 16th month.\n\nThis creates a system of accountability where teams need to perform or they risk losing back most of the funds they crowdfunded. As explained by on DAO Maker's website, \"With a DYCO, 100 percent of the circulating supply is backed by USDC (a stable equivalent for the U.S. dollar) for the first 16 months after the crowd sale. The token supply remains static during this time\" and is governed by a third-party to ensure there is no misappropriation of funds.\n\nIt is important to note that refunds can only be requested and granted if the token value falls more than 20 percent of the initial price. The additional upside is an arbitrage opportunity where contributors could re-purchase tokens below the 20 percent mark and redeem them for a profit. Ideally, a company would want to simply keep the value higher than this point for a win-win.\n\n2. DYCOs remove inflationary risks\n\nIn the case of a claimed refund, companies must burn, or eliminate, the tokens from their supply. This creates a positive impact on the company\u2019s community, as fewer tokens are in circulation despite the refund being processed, as well as a deflationary mechanism that will help retain token value by creating a price floor.\n\nIn past crowdfunded token sales, there was usually a race to the bottom where contributors from multiple rounds race to dump tokens as fast as possible. This was even a problem with projects that enforced some level of lockups. DYCO projects should be selective with their contributors to ensure there is a mutual vision and sense of responsibility. The positive aspect is that the various safeguards prevent most of the common issues seen in previous sales.\n\n3. Founding teams can\u2019t cash out before milestones are hit\n\nTeams, seed contributors, advisors and other internal staff are subject to a holding period of at least 16 months within a DYCO structure. Starting in the 16th month, these tokens will be tranched gradually over the following months to ensure teams remain accountable. If a team member leaves a company, they would still be subject to these lockups. The lockups are enforced by the host platform \u2014 in this case, DAO Maker.\n\nIt is important to note that DYCOs are not for everyone. They should be utilized by companies that are ready to build and commit to a long-term vision that includes very close interaction with various communities and supporters. This is not a cash-grab scenario like many token sales of the past as a significant portion of funds must be reserved for potential refund requests.\n\nRelated: How Blockchain Is Revolutionizing Business-Communication Networks\n\nPotential Risks With DYCOs\n\nAs with any crowdfunding campaign or token sale, participation is usually restricted to certain countries and jurisdictions. Potential participants should ensure that this is not a conflict and also be ready to submit KYC information upon request. This is a professional process that will require information from each contributor. Also, DYCOs should be seen as a long-term opportunity, not something that happens quickly.\n\nDisclaimer: This article is informational and should not be used as investment advice.

A quick Google search of \u201chow to be motivated\u201d brings up over 200 million results, in addition to scores of subtopics like \u201chow to stay motivated\u201d and \u201chow to motivate yourself.\u201d\n\nSo why don\u2019t I use ? Let me share a story to illustrate.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was a keynote speaker at a conference for a network marketing company. After my presentation, one of the top leaders of the company came up to me and said: \u201cNoah, I took six pages of notes while I was listening to you speak. That was one of the best presentations I've ever heard.\u201d\n\nI thanked her, then she said something that I\u2019ll never forget. She said, \u201cBut there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d\n\nUh oh, I thought. Here it comes.\n\nShe said, \u201cIn our program, it says you\u2019re a motivational speaker. But you're not a motivational speaker.\"\n\n\"Really,\" I said. \"What am I?\"\n\nShe said, \"You're not a motivational speaker. You're a motivating speaker.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWow, that's very interesting. What's the difference?\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cWell, a motivational speaker is someone who gets you all pumped up, tells a bunch of stories and gets you all excited. Then you go into the office on Monday, and all of that \u2018motivation\u2019 has evaporated. And you\u2019re like, \u2018What am I supposed to do now?\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cBut you showed us exactly what to do and how to do it. You gave a step-by-step blueprint of exactly how I can reach my goals faster. That\u2019s why you motivated me.\u201d\n\nWhat is motivation?\n\nThe word motivation comes from the Latin word movere, which means \u201cto move.\u201d The word motivation has the same root as the word motor. That origination helps me to remember that motivation in human beings is like the motor in your car \u2014 it\u2019s the thing that causes both of them to move.\n\nTherefore, when you\u2019re thinking about your own motivation, it\u2019s helpful to consider what actually makes you move, as well as what makes you not move. For example, most and business leaders assume that the No. 1 thing that motivates people is money. Of course, everyone wants more money, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that.\n\nHowever, where many entrepreneurs and leaders go astray is assuming that money is the motivator for all of their employees. Interestingly, when I interview entrepreneurs and thought leaders, I often ask them what their motivation for starting their business was. Their answers vary from \"I wanted to make a difference,\" to \"I wanted to help people,\" to \"I wanted to make the world a better place.\" I can't remember one of the 200 entrepreneurs I've interviewed who answered \"I wanted to make a lot of money.\"\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nOf course you know that one of the tenets of goal-setting is to, um, set your goals. That is, to know what you want. I call this process identifying your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\n\nAsk yourself questions like:\n\nWhat do I want in my business?\n\nWhat do I want in my relationships?\n\nWhat do I want in my family life?\n\nWhat do I want to do with my time?\n\nJust like driving in your car, it\u2019s crucial that you know where you want to go. You wouldn\u2019t just jump in your car and drive around in circles, would you? Yet that\u2019s what millions of people are unconsciously doing in their lives.\n\nWhy do you want that?\n\nAfter you\u2019ve identified your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the next step is to ask these key questions that most people forget: Why?\n\nWhy do you want that goal you set in your business?\n\nIn your relationships?\n\nIn your family life?\n\nWith your free time?\n\nThere are only a few reasons why we humans take action, and most (if not all) of them come down to emotions or feelings. So when people tell me their goals, I always ask them, \u201cWhy do you want that?\u201d\n\nFocus on what you actually want\n\nOf course, we all want more time, more money,and more influence. That's all well and good, but why do you want those things? When I ask them this question, my coaching clients will answer:\n\nI want to feel important.\n\nI want to be heard.\n\nI want to be seen.\n\nI want to feel special.\n\nI want to be appreciated.\n\nIn fact, many of the entrepreneurs, executives and athletes I\u2019ve coached over the last two decades discovered that they had been going after external things without realizing the internal reasons that were actually driving them to go after them in the first place.\n\nThe truth is, there's nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with motivation. In fact, motivation is the motor that will keep you moving toward your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. However, understanding not just what you want (your outer motivation), but why you want it (your inner motivation), means that you can move beyond motivation and finally give yourself permission to succeed.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353724", "author": ["Noah St. John"]}, {"title": "The Ultimate 3-Step Formula for Business Success", "text": "July 27, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThinking of starting a business? Theoretically, it isn\u2019t all that difficult. The real trick is in making your business a successful one.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 50 percent of businesses don\u2019t make it to the five-year mark. Additionally, an estimated 90 percent of new startups fail. But why is that? The internet is chock full of checklists that promise to pave the way to success, but are they any good? Sure they are, but only to an extent.\n\nWhile these checklists do an excellent job detailing what novice entrepreneurs need to know, they don\u2019t necessarily provide any real guidance on what actually makes businesses successful. They don\u2019t dive into the psychological hacks and meaningful acts that win hearts and make a lasting impact. They are simply task lists, which we all know are ultimately dry.\n\nSo, what should really be done to increase chances of entrepreneurial success? I decided it would be best to ask an actual powerhouse, so I recently chatted with Misti Cain, the founder of Whyzze and the host of Mailchimp\u2019s newest business reality show, Werrrk! She believes entrepreneurs should ignore 90 percent of the advice offered on how to build a business empire. Instead, she suggests focusing on this three-step formula.\n\nRelated: 10 Women Entrepreneurs Who Are Shattering the Glass Ceiling\n\nStep 1: Show PROOFF\n\n\u201cPROOFF is an acronym,\u201d explains Cain. \u201cIt stands for Positive Real Outcomes Obtained From Figuring (it out). In other words, you need to be able to show the value you provide.\u201d She goes on to explain this can be an essential value, like saving your customers time, money or providing them with peace of mind. Or, it can be a non-essential value like making them look more popular, more intelligent or more successful to others. The point is, the better you can articulate how your product or service takes people from a starting pain point of \"A\" to a desirable end state of \"B,\" the more successful you will be.\n\nCain finds that many entrepreneurs use jargon, wit or flowery language that confuses more than it helps. As an example, she says messaging like, \"We help high-achievers become the best versions of themselves by empowering them to reach their full potential\" is difficult to understand. However, \"We help director-level professionals become C-Suite executives in under two years\" is clear and measurable. You now have a specific value success metric for your business. Once you help your customers achieve this metric, you can use it as PROOFF to attract others.\n\nStep 2: Satisfy a Sizeable Market\n\nAlso known as product-market fit, Cain says the second step of creating lasting business success is making sure what you do satisfies a strong market demand. The higher the number of people who want your product, the better. However, it\u2019s not just about quantity. The stronger their desire for what you\u2019re offering is also key.\n\nCain provides this litmus test to tell if you have product-market fit: Does your business have positive word-of-mouth traction? Are people eager to buy? Would they feel negatively if your product didn\u2019t exist or was taken away? Have your customers tried to solve this issue themselves unsuccessfully and does your product effectively solve it for them? The more yes answers you give, the higher the likelihood you have product-market fit.\n\nStep 3: Live By the Zig Ziglar Principle\n\nRenowned salesman and motivational speaker Zig Ziglar was quoted as saying, \u201cYou can have everything in life you want if you\u2019ll just help other people get what they want.\u201d Likewise, Cain strongly believes in the #givefirst model.\n\n\u201cWhen you make it a point to create a business that is value-driven, people happily pay you, refer you and support you,\u201d she says. \u201cThe pay-it-forward mentality makes steps one and two that much easier as well.\u201d\n\nRelated: A VC's Advice for Raising Capital Post-Covid\n\nAccording to Cain, you should build your business and make business decisions based on a foundation of helping others get what they want. As she advises, \u201cYou may have to make minor or even major adjustments along the way, but you will make substantial progress.\"\n\nThere\u2019s clearly a lot of oomph packed in each of Cain\u2019s three steps, and it\u2019s all easier said than done, but if implemented correctly, the fruits of these efforts might prove a bountiful tool as you build your business toward success.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349342", "author": ["Jennifer Spencer"]}, {"title": "How to Get Free Ad Spend on TikTok", "text": "July 27, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nI\u2019m not going to get into the politics of TikTok operating as a foreign company on U.S. soil. Millions of Americans, and billions around the globe, are using it\u2019s platform, and if you are an entrepreneur, you should know how to use TikTok or have someone on your team that can manage it for you. The ad platform is not very different from Facebook\u2019s, with a few twists. I\u2019ll share what signing up was like for me and how you can get up to $2,300 in free ad spend with TikTok until the end of 2020.\n\nI know what you are thinking. You are thinking exactly what I thought: \u201cI just got a handle on Facebook, Instagram or Google PPC advertising, and now you want me to learn something else? I don\u2019t have the time to do this.\u201d\n\nWhat choice do you have though? You either market your product or service \u2014 hereafter referred to as widget(s) \u2014 where the most eyeballs go, or you shut down. Most entrepreneurs do not have a widget that is so unique or substantially better than everyone else\u2019s that you\u2019d be able to survive on word of mouth alone. Having a great product is important, but the sad reality is that there are a lot of great widgets that never get off the ground due to lack of exposure.\n\nRelated: 3 Reasons TikTok Is Here to Stay\n\nYou can\u2019t afford to wait, hope and pray that your product or service goes viral, but you can strategically place it in front of the right audience. That\u2019s what Facebook and Google have mastered, and it's the reason they are the titans of online advertising. Early adopters of each platform benefited by being first. These benefits included little competition and unbelievably low customer-acquisition costs. That is until, as Gary Vee puts it, \"Marketers ruin everything.\" Once everyone got on those platforms, the rates increased and the advertising rules had to be modified to comply with federal laws to keep scam artists from ripping off the consumer. Advertising online with Google or Facebook should absolutely be part of your online strategy, but you have to play by their rules.\n\nHistory is repeating itself, and you have the opportunity to be an early advertiser on TikTok just like the entrepreneurs and marketers of yesteryear who paved the way on Facebook and Google. This time, though, it\u2019s different. Because of your prior experience with advertising on those two platforms, many of you need less convincing than before. This means that there are more of you who are going to jump in earlier and faster.\n\nAbout a month ago, I saw an ad on Facebook to register as an advertiser with TikTok. Go figure. TikTok advertising on Facebook, so you can advertise on TikTok. Inception much?\n\nOn June 29, I received an email that the Ads Manager was available for me to use. That email sat in my spam box. I missed out on a seven-day window to be ahead of the pack.\n\nOn July 8, I got an email that the platform became available for all U.S. advertisers. I logged in and began the registration process.\n\nIn hindsight, I didn't register the Ads Manager with the same email address that I used to set up my personal TikTok account. I say that because as of right now, my TikTok Ads Manager and my personal account are not connected. What this means is that if anyone engages with my ad, the likes, comments and views are not being credited to my personal account page. I\u2019m sure in the future they will find a way, a la Facebook, to connect the business pages with the advertiser account. But as of right now they are separate. In fact, I don\u2019t get any email alerts about comments or interaction other than the cost per click (CPC) data. Again, I\u2019m sure this will change in the future.\n\nOnce I completed the registration process, I was prompted to submit my business-verification paperwork. I submitted DBA paperwork and corporate paperwork from the Secretary of State. Make sure there is consistency in your documentation. I realize that the structure of some businesses involves multiple levels of ownership, but the more complicated the hierarchy, the more likely you will be required to submit additional paperwork. Keep it simple. If you want to start as a sole proprietorship to make it easy, go right ahead, but you might need to upload a business license from your city or town.\n\nWithin hours, I received an email that said, \u201cUnfortunately we were unable to successfully verify your business. Until your business is successfully verified, you cannot enroll in the TikTok Back to Business Program.\u201d\n\nTikTok\u2019s \u201cBack to Business Program\u201d offers small- and medium-sized businesses up to $2,300 in free advertising assistance. Once approved, you receive a one-time free ad credit of $300 that has to be used by December 31, 2020. Plus, TikTok will match dollar-for-dollar what you spend in advertising up to $2,000 Not a bad deal. I uploaded additional documentation and waited.\n\nOne day later, on July 9, I was notified that my account had been verified and that I could begin advertising. Here is where it\u2019s a little different from advertising on Facebook or Google: TikTok requires that you pre-pay before you can advertise. This may be for the dollar-for-dollar matching program. Once you\u2019ve credited your account, it will reflect bonus credit you receive as part of their promotion. It works. I\u2019ve done it, and it\u2019s almost instant.\n\nCreating the ad is very similar to Facebook\u2019s three step process:\n\nCampaign. Ad group. Ad.\n\nThe targeting process is not as detailed as Facebook\u2019s, nor does it require you to categorize your audience as special groups. I used the same video for my ad that Facebook rejected, only to have it approved by TikTok. This is of course because TikTok hasn\u2019t been taken to court yet on account of, you guessed it, marketers screwing it up. I\u2019m not touting this as your opportunity to cut corners, but it is a little bit easier right now. It won't be like that always.\n\nRelated: How to Use TikTok to Promote Your Business\n\nRight now, my ad is costing me about 13 cents a click. That\u2019s pretty good. I use Google Analytics to monitor how many of those clicks really come through. Just like the clicks that come from my Facebook ads, the clicks reflected on my Analytics report are much less. TikTok does also offer a website pixel along you to track conversions and ultimately retargeting. I am still learning this process and will report back on it in a subsequent post.\n\nThat figure of $2,300 is a lot of money, and I commend TikTok for wooing entrepreneurs like me and you to advertise on their platform. There\u2019s no shame in an entrepreneur's game. You go where the eyeballs go, and right now, the belle of the ball is TikTok. That may change, and when it does, have the courage and mental toughness to adapt to it.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353559", "author": ["Paul Argueta"]}, {"title": "Do You Use the Power of the Present Tense in Storytelling?", "text": "July 27, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nis not new.

If you want them to be fully present, tell your stories using the present tense.\n\nThat brings me to another advantage of telling your stories in the present tense: You often animate, act, play and better use your non-verbal communication while speaking in the present tense. Now, it\u2019s not only storytelling; it\u2019s like \u201cstory playing. A small change makes a big impact.\n\nRelated: Why the Best Storytellers Achieve the Most Brand Awareness\n\nNow, what\u2019s the main reason you want to use stories? To lead, make an impact, influence, sell. That will happen only if the audience members remember your key message. Molecular biologist John Medina wrote in his classic book, Brain Rules: \u201cWhen the brain detects an emotionally charged event, the Amygdala releases dopamine into the system.

You can be a mom and pursue your dreams simultaneously\u2019\n\nWhen a woman chooses to run a business, she is well aware of the \u2018tight-rope walk\u2019 she has ahead. Add to it Motherhood, and the challenges staring her in the face, catapult to another level. Every task she undertakes begins with a deep sense of being impossible. But she keeps going, and sort of achieves the possible. Because she knows, that neither her child nor her work can ever be put at stake!\n\nEvery \u2018mompreneur', realises that it is much more than just a career. It is a mindset, a lifestyle shift that demands extraordinary management skills. She pushes the envelope hard, to be both - a mom and a boss.\n\nFor a \u2018mompreneur\u2019 to create a sustainable work-life balance, and be the best possible version of herself in the two vital roles of a caregiver and a business leader, she realises that the core tenets of both jobs are the same. In fact, they are so similar, that lessons drawn from one can easily be applied to the other, creating a win-win situation for both the \u2018avatars\u2019 she has donned.\n\nTime Management \u2013By befriending discipline, every \u2018mompreneur\u2019 is in control of time, and not the other way round. Having a To-Do list and a plan always helps. Allocating fixed hours for the housework, childcare, workouts, family time and work schedules, go a long way in managing time well. She schedules her meetings by prioritizing them. A working mom deserves some \u2018alone time\u2019 to strategize and brainstorm. By planning her tomorrow, today, she packs in much more. Outsourcing \u2013 A working mom doesn\u2019t have to be a \u2018Superwoman\u2019. Just by hiring the right people to handle tasks such as cooking, grocery shopping, and cleaning, gives her some respite. Finding an efficient nanny or a day-care to look over her child, gets her the much-needed peace of mind. At the workplace, the woman stops thinking of herself as the \u2018know-all\u2019. She trusts her colleagues, allocates jobs they can handle and makes them feel responsible. Respecting deadlines: Both, as an entrepreneur as well as a mom, the lady is bound to face deadlines. By prioritizing her day\u2019s activities, she works better around deadlines. It could be a presentation for the client or a project that her child needs help with. She has realised that the best way to go about it, is to start immediately, and if possible, finish before time. She knows that procrastination can put her in a spot if something unavoidable crops up. Team Management: A reliable team is an asset. A home eco-system with the right kind of help, from family and staff, contributes in myriad ways. Similarly, an efficient team at the workplace helps take a load off the working mom. A team that understands her and her expectations and ethics, is a dream team. So, building the right team, both, at work and at home helps her hugely. By adopting empathy and trust as her compass monitors while building a team, she seldom goes wrong. Persistence & Patience: A \u2018Mompreneur\u2019 never under-estimates these two attributes that contribute hugely in her dual role as mom and entrepreneur. Be it with her kid or her employee, or even a client, these two virtues help her stay calm and make the right decisions. Art of Negotiation: A skill that a parent often uses with the kids demanding that pizza or time out with friends, is no different from bargaining with the vendors or clients. Emotions, luck, or a weak mind have no place at the negotiating table. By knowing her limits and how far she is willing to go on all aspects of the deal, the \u2018mompreneur\u2019 fast-tracks the negotiation process. Connection: For any business to succeed, the \u2018connection\u2019 it makes with its potential customers is crucial. The vital question being, \u2018Is the offering fulfilling a need?\u2019 This trait of \u2018Connection\u2019 comes naturally to a mom. Her innate connection with her child helps the \u2018mompreneur\u2019 in connecting easily with the needs of her client, and therefore in customizing offerings that resonate with the client.\n\nWhen a woman becomes a mother, there is a tendency for her to get \u2018identified\u2019 with motherhood. But a \u2018mompreneur\u2019 knows exactly how and when to distinctly be either. Studies have shown that kids of working moms turn out to be independent, have a strong sense of self-worth, and take on responsibilities early in life. This validates the fact that a \u2018mompreneur\u2019 enriches both the aspects of her life. In the long run, not only does she have children to be proud of, but also a successful business.\n\nYes, being a \u2018Mompreneur\u2019 is worth every little effort!", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353823", "author": ["Tejal Daftary Mehta"]}, {"title": "Digit is Busting Complexity in Insurance With Technology", "text": "July 30, 2020 4 min read\n\nHaving worked in the insurance industry for 30 years, Kamesh Goyal exactly knows the challenges facing it\u2014confusion created by jargon-heavy terms and conditions and the resulant mistrust of the industry.\n\n\u201cInsurance is supposed to be a trust-based system where one is assured help during difficult times,\u201d says the Chairman, Goyal. \u201cIn a country like India where insurance penetration is low, I understood where exactly the challenge and opportunity lay.\u201d\n\nDigit Insurance, one of the first fully cloud-based insurance firms in India, came about in 2016 with Goyal wanting to \u2018make insurance simple\u2019 through technology. The core idea was to simplify the customer\u2019s journey and provide them with a seamless experience, right from picking products, to policy issuance to claim processes, as per Goyal.\n\nThe full-stack insurtech startup powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), image analytics, tracking technologies and data lakes, builds general insurance products, such as motor, health, travel and home insurance, among others.\n\nThe two-year old company has served 6.9 million customers till date, underwritten premiums worth INR 2,200 crore and processed over 2 lakh claims. It claims to have gained 1.2 per cent market share of the overall Indian Insurance sector within two years of operations.\n\nGoyal also counts its Net Promoter Score (NPS)\u2014a service quality metric\u2014of over 80 an achievement for the company. The highest NPS score among the major private sector insurers is 70.3 (of ICICI Lombard GIC) in motor insurance category, 62.1 (of Bajaj Allianz) in life insurance and 76.7 (of Apollo Munich) in health insurance, as per Numr Research\u2019s Insurance NPS 2019 survey.\n\nEnd-to-end Tech Solutions\u2014Products, Documents and Claims\n\nDigit integrates technology-enabled processes across distribution, buying and claims processing.\n\n\u201cThe use of ML, AI and image analytics help us in faster fraud management and claims settlement,\u201d says Goyal. For instance, in the case of bike insurance AI-based technology solutions recognise basic checks like bike registration number, the colour of the bike, etc, which not only speeds up the process of inspection but also of policy issuance.\n\nSimilarly, travel insurance policies make use of real-time flight tracking to proactively register a claim in case of a delay. \u201cWe provide a three-step, 100 per cent automated claims process for our flight-delay product,\u201d explains Goyal. \u201cIf a flight is delayed beyond 75 minutes, we track it, send the customers an SMS asking for their boarding pass and bank details and process the claim.\u201d In contrast to the industry standard of offering a claim only when the customer\u2019s flight is delayed for over six hours, Digit claims to offer insurance payout for 75 minutes of delay.\n\nThe company also offers an audio claim feature that eliminates the need for the insured to fill long applications. The customer calls to register a claim, which is taped and transcribed to extract and store details for processing the claim.\n\nOn the business side of the things, the all-digital model has reduced the company\u2019s infrastructure and operational costs, as per Goyal. Though Goyal refused to reveal the numbers, a June 2019 report on insurance sector by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) shows that digitisation can reduce around 20\u201330 per cent of the cost of non-life insurance products and 15\u201320 per cent of the cost of life insurance.\n\nDigit\u2019s technology-focused model has garnered sizeable investor interest since the company\u2019s inception. Indo-Canadian business tycoon Prem Watsa, who is chairman and founder of Fairfax Financials Holdings, pumped INR 350 crore into the company in return of 45 per cent stake even before Digit rolled out its operation in November 2017 on getting the regulatory nod. Later, Fairfax invested USD 44 million seed amount in Digit, followed by more in subsequent rounds.\n\nThe Bengaluru-based startup has raised cumulative USD 224 million in funding so far from A91 Partners, Faering Capital and TVS Capital, apart from Fairfax.\n\nEmpowering Partner Companies with API-based Solutions\n\nNot just customers, Digit aspires to simplify the journey of its partner companies as well. It\u2019s application program interface (API) based solutions allows partner companies, which includes insurance aggregator Policybazaar, Flipkart, ClearTrip and Axis Bank, among others, to cancel or make amendments to the policy.\n\n\u201cWe have built a cloud based interface with our partners especially for endorsements and cancellation. When partner companies need to make changes to the policy documents or cancel a policy, they do not need write us email asking for the changes. Instead, they can select the data fields that need to be changed, upload the relevant documents on the portal and the request is processed via a bot,\u201d Goyal explains.\n\nIn the coming months, Digit wants to devise tech solutions to empower Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by offering them zero touch processes, both for claims and policy issuance.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354039", "author": ["Shipra Singh"]}, {"title": "Telegram Is the Latest Company to File An EU Antitrust Complaint Against Apple", "text": "July 30, 2020 2 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on Engadget\n\n\n\nIf big tech thought that its antitrust reckoning would end with yesterday\u2019s hearings, it\u2019ll have its optimism sorely dented by what\u2019s likely to follow. A number of smaller players are lobbing grenades over the fence in the hope of forcing regulators on both sides of the Atlantic to intervene. Today, secure messaging app Telegram is joining in, filing a formal antitrust complaint to the European Union\u2019s competition authority.\n\nAs the Financial Times points out, it\u2019s the third big name, after Spotify and Rakuten, that has lobbied the EU to do something about the App Store\u2019s lock-in and 30 percent commission. And here, as then, the general sentiment is that the commission is too high, and that not allowing users to download from other sources is harming competition.\n\nA few days ago, Telegram co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov published an open letter concerning Apple\u2019s \u201c30 percent tax on apps.\u201d That includes a claim that running the app store does not cost what Apple generates in revenue, and that app-store fees did not exist in the PC era.

The novel coronavirus has not just endangered human lives but it has also hit the world economy hard and impacted several industries around the globe. It has turned markets around, giving rise to trends and disruptions we could not have imagined.\n\nRetail is clearly one of the most severely impacted industries by the pandemic. In the past six months, retailers and consumer goods manufacturers across India have dealt with fast-changing consumer buying patterns and numerous setbacks in ensuring smooth business operations.\n\nThe pandemic has changed the way millions of Indians live, the way they work, the way they shop and even the things they shop. As people hibernated indoors, online stockpiling of essentials skyrocketed and the demand for fast and safe home deliveries increased tremendously. At the same time, to avoid crowded supermarkets, people are going for contactless shopping alternatives such as Zomato, Swiggy, Grofers, BigBasket and Dunzo.\n\nHyperlocal delivery is emerging as a growing trend in the Indian market, as more and more storekeepers are now adopting multichannel strategies to cater to customer demands. This webinar by Entrepreneur India, features key players in retail and logistics who examines the impact this public health emergency has had on the practice-related aspects and how they can prepare for the future by remodeling new business models now.\n\nConvenience over cost\n\nHyperlocal groups come in a huge variety of sizes, leadership styles, and goal-orientations, but they all share one crucial trait: they exist to create value and return value back to their local communities. They collaborate to access resources together, such as group purchases of groceries to limit individual exposure to health risks.\n\nTo respond to the current crisis and meet future ones, food retailers need to use technology in new and different ways to scale up their e-commerce establishments and their capacity for home delivery. They can do so by expanding shifts in existing warehouses and converting a few retail locations into convenient stores. They can also use technology to enable their business and support consumers, not only by increasing their self-checkouts but also by looking end to end and considering how technology can make things safer for customers. Both e-commerce improvements and tech enablement will require new capabilities and talent possibly from other industries or an investment in retraining current employees.\n\nPaytm Mall has launched several initiatives to help stressed businesses including its merchant partners, small shop owners, SMEs as the COVID-19 pandemic has brought their businesses to a standstill. The company will help shops and stores, which have either witnessed a sharp decline in footfall or had to abruptly halt operations due to the lockdown, digitally enabling them through Paytm Mall and giving them all the necessary logistics support. \"Paytm Mall has always advocated a 100 per cent marketplace model of operation against an inventory led one as pursued by other major players. Our objective is to connect neighborhood offline stores to interested customers far and wide through our e-commerce platform,\" says Srinivas Mothey, senior vice-president, Paytm Mall. \u201cA lot of interesting integrations are happening right now so it is a very collaborative space at this time rather than looking at purely competition and taking away market share is not advisable,\u201d he adds.\n\nAs coronavirus has spread around the world, even as most physical grocery stores remain open, many consumers, fearing for the health and safety of themselves and their loved ones, have sought to eliminate all but the most essential visits to stores from their daily or weekly routines.\n\nAs a result, many grocery retailers have seen their online sales increase at an astounding rate. Perhaps no companies operating within the online grocery sector have seen the shift in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as much as hyperlocal delivery services that focus primarily on the grocery space, as consumers in many markets have turned to these companies to have groceries delivered from their favorite local supermarkets. \u201cRetailers will have to survive, adapt to the new digitization and eventually have to come around if they want to sustain in the market,\u201d says co-founder of Ninjacart, Vasudevan Chinnathambi.\n\nWith demand for grocery delivery at an all-time high, legacy grocers that do not operate their own delivery services\u2014and may have been reluctant to hand over a slice of their sales to third-party service partners in the past\u2014are now scrambling to work with hyperlocal players. As a result, hyperlocal grocery delivery sales have exploded.\n\nAlthough most grocery retailers around the world have been rightly classified as \u201cessential\u201d businesses during the pandemic and remained open, consumers\u2019 needs have rapidly changed during this unusual time. As a result, companies operating in the food retail and delivery space need to rapidly adapt new technology to meet the needs of consumers looking to reduce the time they spend in stores, substitute in-person interactions with digital touch points, and smooth out the checkout, payment and logistics experiences. Most companies will not be able to complete transformation of an entire channel overnight, but all can think about small steps to meet the new needs of shoppers.\n\nOne such relatively quick, low-cost solution has been seen in the form of partnerships between hyperlocal delivery services and grocery retailers. However, although in the short-run these on-demand delivery services will prove essential for many shoppers and retailers alike, the expected global recession in 2020 will have a negative impact on any possible permanent consumer behavior shifts given that delivery costs of such services remain high and may prove prohibitive as a long-term grocery delivery solution.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an opportunity of a lifetime as we are learning about crisis that while there was a crisis and there will still continue to be a crisis for some time to come as we are seeing this excellent opportunity to rethink and rewrite business models to improve our economics that can allows us to deliver our services at better year of economics. We are already seeing improvement in business economics across the board, it is also helping us recognize some short-term and permanent changes in consumer behavior which we have never predicted before,\u201d says Prashant Mehta, partner at Lightbox. \u201cConsumers are seeing that the ability of transparency they are getting in terms of quality of products, the fact that they are certain that these are no-contact deliveries, they are getting information for temperatures of people that are delivering their goods. They are clearly getting a better sense of security and in turn it has helped us retool a significant part of our businesses,\u201d mentions Mehta.\n\nThe hyperlocal business model is here to stay, even after the pandemic drifts away. It offers tremendous scope for growth in a number of sectors beyond groceries and essentials, such as food and beverages, medicines, home services, cabs, and hyperlocal logistics, to name a few. It is time for retailers to keep up with the trend and make the most of the hyperlocal delivery model to stay ahead of the competition in post-COVID-19 times.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/video/353761", "author": ["Prabhjeet Bhatla"]}, {"title": "Entrepreneur Pick: #5 Top Fitness Trackers/ Smartwatches with Good Battery Life Under INR 5000", "text": "July 27, 2020 3 min read\n\nThe new-age tech innovation is enhancing the functionality and widening the options in the fitness segment.

Various activities were planned to celebrate this historic milestone, but the coronavirus pandemic put a damper. Then came the grisly clash between the troops of the two nations in eastern Ladakh\u2019s Galwan Valley, due to a border row that escalated quickly. Twenty Indian soldiers were martyred in this confrontation with the Chinese PLA at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).\n\nThe alleged initial mishandling of the COVID-19 outbreak in the city of Wuhan by the Chinese government, coupled with the border clashes in Galwan has invoked anti-China sentiments across India. Angry street protests erupted across the country, with people breaking Chinese televisions and smartphones, burning Chinese goods and effigies of Chinese President Xi Jinping, and calling for a boycott of Chinese products, even Chinese food.\n\nThe Great Wall Against China\n\nCiting national security concerns, the Indian government recently banned 59 apps developed by Chinese firms, including Bytedance\u2019s immensely popular TikTok. Later, 47 more apps were banned and 250 have been put under scanner including the hugely popular gaming app PubG. According to reports, a few days ago, the government notified new rules for the e-commerce companies, including the mandatory display of 'country of origin' on all products sold on their platforms. Failure to do so will attract penal action.\n\nThis move will allow consumers to identify and boycott Chinese goods and choose \u2018Make in India\u2019 products. Although the Indian government hasn\u2019t explicitly announced or outlined any \u2018boycott China\u2019 policies, many state governments and PSUs are planning to refrain from awarding tenders and contracts to Chinese firms and some are even canceling the contracts that have been previously awarded to Chinese companies.\n\nPrior to all these moves, the Indian government had also tweaked its extant FDI policy, thereby requiring government\u2019s approval for all FDI proposals coming from any country that shares a land border with India. According to the government, this step was taken to curb opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. This rising anti-China rhetoric, however, could result in deep-rooted consequences for the thriving Indian startup ecosystem, as much of its accelerated growth has been fuelled by massive Chinese investments.\n\nThe Deep Impact Of Chinese Investment On Indian Startups\n\nIndia is home to one of the largest startup ecosystems in the world, which has grown exponentially over the year. According to a Tracxn report, \u201cThe decade has seen an impressive 25 times growth from a tiny $550 million in 2010 to $14.5 billion in 2019 in terms of the total funding raised by startups.\u201d\n\nBut, the ecosystem owes a major chunk of this growth to Chinese investments, which not only helped the startups to scale exponentially but also helped them create an impact on a global level.\n\nAccording to a February report by foreign policy think tank Gateway House-Indian Council on Global Relations, Chinese tech investors have put an estimated $4 billion into Indian start-ups. Out of the 30 unicorns in India, 18 are backed by Chinese investors. Fintech giant Paytm, online grocery retailer BigBasket, food delivery startups Zomato and Swiggy, ride-sharing platform Ola, and Walmart-owned Flipkart have thus far received billions of dollars in Chinese investment.\n\nA recent report by data analytics and consulting company, GlobalData also suggests that there has been a 12 times growth of Chinese investments in Indian startups over the last four years\u2014$381 million in 2016 to $4.6 billion in 2019. According to the report, both corporates, as well as pure-play investment firms from China have invested in Indian unicorns.\n\nDuring the pre-COVID era, access to funds has been relatively easy for Indian startups due to Chinese investors with deep pockets being eager to invest in India. \u201cChinese investors are highly motivated to invest in the Internet startups of India, which is the second-most populous country with more than 500 million Internet users. Moreover, the lack of tech giants to invest huge amounts of money in the country\u2019s startups at a desirable speed is often driving young Indian entrepreneurs to look out to China for quick capital,\u201d said Kiran Raj, principal disruptive tech analyst at GlobalData.\n\nBut, the pandemic and the current geo-political scenario have deeply altered the fundraising demand-supply equation for the Indian startup ecosystem.\n\nThe Collateral Damage\n\nAlthough 2019 was an exemplary year for the Indian startup ecosystem in terms of fundraising, things aren\u2019t going that well in 2020. According to Tracxn, in the first six months of 2020, startup funding dipped to $4.2 billion\u2014a 29 per cent decrease from $5.9 billion in the same period last year.\n\nWhile this drop can be largely attributed to the coronavirus pandemic and the economic uncertainty it brought upon the world, the new FDI policy that regulates Chinese investments in India has not helped the situation. Although the new policy has been put in place to prevent opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the collateral damage is faced by the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n\nTalking about the impact of tweaked FDI policy on the influx of Chinese investments in the Indian startup ecosystem, Abhishek Goyal, founder, Tracxn, told Entrepreneur India, \u201cThe new FDI policy should have a significant impact on the investment inflow. Investors do not like geo-political uncertainty while making investments and most believe that relations between the two countries will remain difficult in the coming days. Relations may see a new low if India is able to attract a meaningful number of manufacturing outfits from China. Largely, border issues cannot be seen only with an economic impact of one segment.\u201d\n\nNitin Sharma, founder of FirstPrinciples, said, \u201cIn the short-to-medium term, it will have a drastic impact. Through our own portfolio, we are learning that many smaller funds and corporates are understandably wary and even if the non-automatic route is feasible, they may tread cautiously for 9-12 months. In the long-term, and with respect to larger funds or strategics like Tencent or Alibaba, I am sure they will continue to explore the growth opportunities in the Indian market actively and wait for the environment to evolve.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ben Mathias, managing partner, Vertex Ventures, several startups were in the process of raising financing rounds from Chinese investors and these have been delayed or called-off due to the new FDI policy. This will impact unicorns more than early-stage startups because there are fewer players who can write larger checks.\n\nThe current version of the new FDI policy is quite ambiguous as there are plenty of details that still need to be ironed out and loopholes left to be plugged. Transparency is an integral factor in international fundraising. Therefore, the ambiguity, coupled with the added red-tapism, might create apprehensions in the minds of potential and existing Chinese investors.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of any clarifications from the government on whether there is any threshold up to which investments will be automatically permitted or sectors that will be exempted from prior approval, it seems like all new and existing investors from China (and other entities which are incorporated in a country which shares its land borders with India, or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country) will need to obtain prior government approval before they can invest new money into Indian companies or fund more equity into existing investments for growth purposes,\u201d explained Delano Furtado, a partner with law firm Trilegal.\n\n\u201cThere is also no timeline prescribed on how long it would take to acquire government approval, but if you were to compare with previous timelines taken to obtain government approval for FDI, we could be looking at anything between 4-6 weeks for FDI investments to be approved. If border tensions between China and India continue, the time taken for obtaining government approvals could be impacted even more in some of the more sensitive sectors,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Moral Quandary\n\nThe rising anti-China sentiments in India have even made certain Indian startups increasingly morally apprehensive about raising Chinese investments. Rakesh Mohan Joshi, professor and chairperson, International Collaborations & Research, IIFT, believes that the rising sentiments of self-reliance among Indians, combined with other protectionist measures that have been established, could not only potentially hamper Chinese investment in India but also make Indian startups more apprehensive of sourcing Chinese capital.\n\n\u201cWhen you combine increased regulatory scrutiny, longer timelines for investment, and in some cases, optics with respect to their own customer base, I think it\u2019s fair to say Indian startups will tread more cautiously for some time,\u201d opined Sharma of FirstPrinciples.\n\nGoyal believes that it would be difficult for a startup to turn its back on a potential funding source, given the sizable mindshare startups have to spend on raising capital. Although, according to him, announcing it publicly or even internally would prove to be the difficult part as some employees might question if it was right to take capital from Chinese investors.\n\nWhat If The Chinese Investments Dry Up?\n\nRising anti-China sentiments, protectionist policies and regulations, and continued tensions between China and India could potentially cause the funding from Chinese investors for Indian startups to dry up.\n\nA number of stakeholders in the ecosystem believe that Indian startups are resilient enough to absorb the impact of the Chinese funds drying up. The startups will have to acclimatize to the new normal.\n\n\u201cStartups and founders are very resilient and they will learn to adapt to the changed environment. Business practices that seemed right when the capital was available, will now be put to the test. Growth will slow down, but then this is really relative as even competition will be facing the same challenges and slowing down will not be at the cost of loss of market share. Some may not survive; which is Darwin\u2019s theory playing out in the startup world. Customers may feel less pampered\u2014and will have to learn to pay for services that were hitherto free\u2014which is also a development in the right direction,\u201d Verma said.\n\nHe believes that between the unicorns and early-stage startups, the unicorns\u2014being bigger\u2014are more likely to face the challenges associated with the freezing of Chinese funds.\n\n\u201cThe unicorns and other large tech startups are adjusting to the new reality by rapidly reducing their cash burn, extending their runways and boosting their chances of profitability and subsequent IPO listings. The double-whammy is of course because of the economic impact of COVID-19 in parallel,\u201d believes Sharma of FirstPrinciples.\n\nIn the case of early-stage startups, he is of the opinion that the slowdown is primarily because of COVID-19 and the recession. \u201cAs later-stage valuations correct because of the absence of China\u2019s capital, it will have a lagging effect on early-stage as well, but that will be clearer in a few months.\u201d\n\nAccording to Goyal, startups in the pre-unicorn phase have a lot less dependence on Chinese capital. \u201cQuality startups have access to capital in most scenarios; price may get slightly impacted or it may take longer. Recent Jio fundraise has clearly demonstrated that assets with a good hope story will have enough and more capital coming their way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the current pandemic and global environment in which consumer demand is subdued and liquidity remains a concern, most startups whether unicorns or early-stage companies will be faced with a huge level of uncertainty on whether they can count on future investments from their Chinese shareholders to tide over the current crisis,\u201d Furtado opines.\n\nHe believes that for the early-stage companies, it may be a question of survival if clarifications do not come from the government soon enough. \u201cAs for the unicorns, given that they already have achieved some amount of recognition globally and domestically, they may find it easier to find alternative backers from new investors in other countries. However, this will be an uphill task and could also impact future outlook and growth for these unicorns.\u201d\n\nHome Is Where the Money Is\n\nThe current geo-political scenario and the dearth of Chinese investment have created a fund-raising vacuum in the Indian startup ecosystem that could potentially be filled by alternative funding sources and open up investment-centric avenues from other countries. But, the first and the most obvious alternative source of funding would be Indian investors.\n\nHowever, according to a recent IVCA-EY report, the last three years witnessed approximately $111.7 billion worth of long-term capital being invested into Indian companies, more than 80 per cent of which was from foreign capital.\n\nIs it time for Indian investors to step up and invest more in homegrown startups so that the ecosystem\u2019s reliance on foreign money can be mitigated?\n\nVerma believes it is. \u201cThe strongest and most resilient is the domestic market and what has been very positive in the last few years is the emergence of alternative investment funds (AIF), which have raised capital from the domestic market. They have largely been in the early stages \u2013 angel funds, Series A funds, and there is a need to encourage later stage capital funds also.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly in the last 4-5 years, we have seen domestic capital entering the startup ecosystem. This is after the massive success of Flipkart and the rise of startups like Ola, Byju's and OYO. Domestic capital will increase as there is more wealth creation among existing investors. Investors will follow the returns,\u201d Goyal opines.\n\nDuring a recent webinar, Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal called upon Indian investors to come forward and play a greater role in supporting the Indian startups and invest more in them.\n\nHe also highlighted the fact that the Indian government has also been playing its part in strengthening the startup ecosystem and that there are more steps that need to be taken to further enhance the ease of doing business quotient for the startups.\n\nGovernment & Policy-makers: The Domestic Investment Catalysts\n\nThe government does play a crucial role when it comes to promoting the flow of domestic capital into the Indian startup ecosystem; favorable policies can certainly help in doing so. \u201cAs most of the Indian unicorns are funded by foreign capitals, induction of indigenous capital would always be a welcome step as it would reduce their dependence on foreign capital. This requires both India\u2019s institutional structure as well as a policy framework to support Indian investments in the startups,\u201d says Prof. Joshi.\n\nAccording to Goyal of Traxcn, \u201cPolicy can play a huge role in it - they can bring capital gains on private market returns (20 per cent) in line with public equity returns (10 per cent) and reduce the overhead of paperwork when selling shares in private companies.\u201d\n\nHe believes that initiatives such as allowing the offsetting of capital gains in startups against investing in other startups or offering tax breaks on capital gains against investment in venture and private equity will definitely instigate Indian investors to invest more in Indian startups.\n\nSharma also believes that the government can catalyze domestic investment by encouraging the large state entities like LIC or banks to increase exposure to the venture asset class.\n\nHe is also of the opinion that traditional Indian corporates will learn from the evolution of the US market and local examples like Jio, and realize that the Indian economy and markets will become more and more dominated by technology. \u201cFor them, investments in startups and VC funds, or acquisition of tech startups, can be key to bridging the innovation or talent gaps.\u201d\n\nDo Indian Investors Have The Dry Powder To Plug The Funding Gap?\n\nAlthough the notion of Indian investors stepping up and filling the Chinese funding void may seem like a lucrative and obvious choice, it might not be a feasible option. Over the years, Chinese investors have pumped billions of dollars into the Indian startup ecosystem. So, the crucial question that arises here is whether Indian investors have the required dry powder to fill the funding void that might be created by the lack of Chinese investments in India.\n\n\u201cNo, there is not enough domestic capital formation in the venture capital asset class,\u201d opines Sharma.\n\n\u201cIn China, more than 80 per cent of VC capital is domestically sourced, whereas, in India, that number is probably less than 5 per cent. It will take time for Indian institutions like pension funds, banks or insurance companies, or corporates and family offices, in general, to make significant allocations as limited partners (LPs) in VC funds or to invest directly. This needs to be pushed aggressively by the government,\u201d says Sharma.\n\n\u201cChina is the world\u2019s second-largest VC market with over 3,500 firms compared with less than 100 in India. Moreover, a large number of profit-making Chinese companies invest in other businesses compared to India,\u201d Prof. Joshi highlighted.\n\nHe believes that although the Indian startup and investment ecosystem have evolved rapidly over the years, the fund requirement of Indian startups, presently, exceeds the funds available for investment indigenously to meet their needs. Therefore, Indian startups invariably need to explore foreign capital.\n\nLooking Beyond The Great Wall\n\nTalking about alternative funding sources for Indian startups, Goyal of Traxcn said, \u201cFortunately, India has been an investment hotspot among private market investors from a very diverse set of geographies. It is expected that limited partners across the world will continue to back Funds investing in India. Japanese and South Korean investors have been aggressively trying to stay ahead of Chinese investors in India.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mathais, investors from other countries are already compensating for the shortfall in funds. \u201cWe have already started seeing this happen with significant investment commitments being made by Google, Facebook, and other major US technology companies in recent weeks. There is also an increased investment activity from Japan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the gap might be partly met by the likes of Jio (with a $20 billion war chest) or existing Indian investors with dry powder. Next, some US or Middle East investors who have some India exposure may perhaps opportunistically fill in the gap, but it may not match the size and speed of Chinese investors in 2017-19,\u201d Sharma opined.\n\n\u201cI don't think any other country will be able to fill up the gap. US funds typically come in later stages and not at early stages\u2014Series D and later. Japan has been investing but typically smaller tickets as Japan does not have a large VC base like the US\u2014behemoths like Softbank are more an aberration. I think the Middle East can be interesting; especially for healthcare and education\u2014two sectors that they like. B2B commerce could also be of interest to them,\u201d said Verma.\n\nHe believes that there will be a gap that will be filled up over a period of time, largely by new funds that will come up with a combination of domestic and international money from the Middle East and the US.\n\n\u201cThe Indian digital story is COVID-resistant, even during these uncertain times we have seen investments from North America, the Middle East come into the digital ecosystem of India,\u201d believes Amit Bhandari, fellow, Energy and Environment Studies Programme, Gateway House.\n\nHe thinks that the European privately held family funds and European sovereign funds will also be looking at India. \u201cIndia needs a well-calibrated diplomatic outreach to tap these funds. So the Indian tech and startup systems have ample opportunities to tap the overseas markets. A few Indian entities have also raised capital in the past 6 weeks those funds will also be deployed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Prof. Joshi, in view of an innovative strategic approach, the potential for growth and market size Indian start-ups are getting increasingly attractive for investors from the US, Japan, Singapore, and a number of European countries. Even investors from non-traditional countries such as South Africa have invested in Indian start-ups such as Swiggy and Byju\u2019s indicating their growing fascination worldwide.\n\nGoyal of Traxcn believes that India is at a stage where its dependence on Chinese capital is not as high. \u201cThe Indian startup ecosystem has found the right impetus in the last 10 years and is producing better companies than ever before. If we continue this momentum and don't do anything counter-productive, capital will be available for worthwhile startups.\u201d", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354010", "author": ["Rahul Raj"]}, {"title": "Want Millions of Views for Your Virtual Event?

Game over.\n\nIt was all part of the event Shaq's Fun House vs Gronk Beach, which featured the larger-than-life personalities squaring off in a series of goofy challenges, with appearances by DaBaby, Snoop Dogg, Steve Aoki, Diplo and more.\n\nThe event, which raised money for the NAACP and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and delivered 1.25M meals to Feeding America, was produced by Medium Rare, a live and brand activation company.\n\nRelated: How Shaq Is Bringing Fun Back to Papa John's\n\nEntrepreneur spoke with Medium Rare\u2019s co-founders, Joe Silberzweig and Adam Richman, about what it takes to pull off an event like this, and what they see in the near future for the live events industry. Here are some of the highlights of that conversation.\n\nLife in the live events business\n\nAdam Richman: It hasn't been talked about much, and there aren't any bills from Congress really aimed at helping out concert promoters or people in the live entertainment industry. We know a lot of our colleagues and friends who are really hurting. It\u2019s really been hard for them to do anything during this time, and that's sort of where we stood a few months ago. We were sitting there saying, \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d And that's when the lightbulb went off. \u201cLet's go virtual!\" It worked so great with Gronk and Shaq\u2019s two special brands. We don\u2019t know exactly what the future will bring in terms of in-person or hybrid events, but everything we\u2019re planning for November and December will be 100 percent virtual.\n\nVirtual events can be more than a glorified Zoom call\n\nJoe Silberzweig: There have been hundreds of live streams events since the pandemic hit, but most of them are Zoom calls or Instagram Lives with pretty janky quality. We really saw the opportunity to do something bigger, more polished, more produced, and that's where we see the future of going.\n\nRelated: 9 Powerful Quotes from NBA All-Star and Entrepreneur Shaq\n\nAR: We really took the initiative of promoting and marketing and this like it was one of our in-person events. We didn\u2019t just post a link and say, \u201cHey, we're going live tomorrow at 10:00 PM. Make sure you check us out on Instagram or Twitter or whatever.\u201d We really did a full-on campaign. We had a national press conference, did a full-on social campaign, email blast \u2014 really treated it like we would any of our big events. And we think that allowed us to shine through. It gave consumers the confidence that this wasn't going to just be another basic live stream.\n\nUnforeseen challenges\n\nJS: The music talent we worked with are used to performing in an arena with a million dollars of production behind them. So you can\u2019t just say, \"Hey, can you rap in front of your living room couch?\u201d So this challenged us to figure out ways to make it look like a music video, not just something streaming off someone\u2019s phone. We knew we needed to the highest production values possible while keeping staff and talent safe.\n\nAR: And for big live events, a challenge can be making sure artists are at the venue and ready to go on time. It was a little shocking that for a virtual event, it is sort of the same thing! You know, where we FaceTimed one or two of the artists to bring them onto the screen, and they pick up and they are in their car driving. So some things never change!\n\nStaying calm in the storm\n\nJS: During the game of HORSE between Shaq and Gronk, we had a tech issue. So Adam and I were freaking out. I think 5 million people watching at that time and it was all pretty nuts. But our team worked through the issue and got it working and instantly at that moment, Shaq ripped off the rim. And that was really the biggest, most viral moment of the entire livestream. Now, I say we were freaking out, but that was on the inside. On the exterior, you need to stay calm and collected and lead your team through difficulties like that.\n\nRelated: Gronk Gets Into The CBD Business\n\nThe viability of virtual events\n\nAR: We consider ourselves quite lucky that we've been able to quickly make this pivot to streaming. We did lose hundreds and hundreds of live events due to the pandemic, but it is encouraging to see how many artists and personalities are embracing the possibilities. And it's really nice to see sponsors playing in the space as well and transitioning and believing in this model.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354015", "author": ["Dan Bova"]}, {"title": "The Pro Sports Pandemic-Leadership Report Card", "text": "July 30, 2020 5 min read\n\nLater tonight, the resumes its 2019-20 campaign when the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans tip off at ESPN's Wide World of Complex within Walt Disney World. The league's approach, which adheres to a 113-page document of protocols outlining strict isolation and mitigation measures, has been described as operating within a \"bubble.\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver doesn't favor the phrase, but he has to be enjoying all the praise being thrown his way, particularly on the heels of announcing that precisely zero of his players have tested positive for each of the last two weeks. (The WNBA, which kicked off games on July 25, is stationed in a similar bubble setup at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, though accounts of their accommodations have been mixed at best, and several players tested positive as recently as three weeks prior to competition.)\n\nMajor League Baseball, meanwhile, concretized far more flexible parameters concerning players' off-field movements before initiating an abbreviated 60-game ledger on July 24. And already, one club \u2014 the Miami Marlins \u2014 has been gripped by an outbreak that's sidelined 17 players and two coaches as of this writing and put its, and MLB's, restarted season in serious jeopardy.\n\nWith the NHL set to experiment with a frenzied playoff format taking place entirely in Canada this weekend, and the pledging to proceed with business as usual on Sept. 10, it's not too early to assess how each of the four major American professional sports' commissioners have acquitted themselves as leaders. So without further delay \u2014 whether or not one feels this whole conversation should be deferred until 2021 \u2014 here's how we grade the ultimate shot-callers' -era poise.\n\nRelated: How the Pandemic is Driving Innovation in Sports Business\n\nThe League: Major League Baseball\n\nThe Commissioner: Rob Manfred\n\nHow's He Leading? It hasn't been an easy half-decade on top for Manfred, who just weathered the Houston Astros' sign-stealing controversy before the pandemic torpedoed his 2020 season right in the midst of spring training. He has had to contend with a tenacious players union that was fairly intransigent when it came to limiting off-field comings-and-goings, but ultimately MLB's mitigation efforts \u2014 which rely largely on individual accountability as clubs travel from one regional city to the next and attempt to rein in familiar, touchy-feely in-game rituals \u2014 are far too vulnerable to further viral spread, as we've already seen. And although laissez-faire managers and undisciplined players aren't helping, it's Manfred who looks most exposed as an ineffective administrator.\n\nGrade: C\n\nThe League: NHL\n\nThe Commissioner: Gary Bettman\n\nHow's He Leading? For once, the league's oft-maligned longtime leader looks prescient by comparison. The decision to relocate north of the border \u2014 to a pair of sites in Edmonton and Toronto \u2014 for a fast-and-furious 24-team playoff tourney makes both practical sense and piques anticipation for what is already the NHL's most widely watched run of games. And given that MLB's lone Canadian-based franchise, the Toronto Blue Jays, weren't even OK'd to touch down in the country and have been exiled to Buffalo, New York, Bettman's early commitment to get out of dodge looks downright ingenious. As for his boasts that 2020-21 will be hiccup-free, he sounds a bit more like the next guy on our docket.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nThe League: NFL\n\nThe Commissioner: Roger Goodell\n\nHow's He Leading? Well, one front \u2014 acknowledging players' rights to express their feelings about what's going on in the world outside of the gridiron \u2014 Goodell has finally evolved beyond his reputation as hopelessly in thrall of team owners' wants and wealth. That said, he and the NFL have been characteristically hubristic from jump when it comes to the pandemic, hyping draft picks and free-agent activity like it were 1999 and going full steam ahead with plans for a steady 17-week schedule at all 31 stadiums, fan attendance be damned (though they were slow to concede to that hard truth). And even this month, players were vocal about feeling unprotected from the inherent risks, prompting assurances of more robust testing procedures. Effectively, the NFL is MLB inverted: The players are forcing their league to properly insulate them from the virus (there have been dozens of positive cases heading into training camps), despite Goodell and the NFL's comparatively cavalier tone. We'll see how Goodell responds if and when a Marlins-like crisis comes to fore, but for the time being, he's mostly taking cues from his personnel rather than charting a consoling course.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nRelated: Niche Sports Leagues Entrepreneurs Can Learn About, and Profit From\n\nThe League: NBA\n\nThe Commissioner: Adam Silver\n\nHow's He Leading: By example. And definitively. As alluded to earlier, he spearheaded the immediate compilation of comprehensive instructions on how all players and personnel are expected to comport themselves. And this thing is detailed, down to who can swim in which pool at the complex and how to properly procure snacks on-site. Silver got some flack back in March for hoarding tests when there was scattered public access to them, and there is certainly still a pertinent debate about whether sports should be prioritized by private labs as case counts surge across the country. But the facts on the ground are that sports are back, whether it's our personal preference or not. And Silver has at least led the way in ensuring that his league won't be responsible for compounding community spread and further burdening frontline workers. That he has the virtually unquestioned support of the league's biggest stars speaks as much to their values as Silver's influence, but considering that the NBA was once a cautionary coronavirus tale (see: Rudy Gobert), the turnaround in perception and reality is remarkable.\n\nGrade: A", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354029", "author": ["Kenny Herzog"]}, {"title": "Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook Execs Face Congress: 9 Big Takeaways", "text": "July 30, 2020 12 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on PCMag\n\n\n\nThe CEOs of Apple, Amazon, , and Facebook faced the House Judiciary Committee virtually today, where they fielded questions about whether their respective tech companies take advantage of their dominant positions in the market to enhance their bottom lines.\n\nSpoiler: They all said they don\u2019t.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg offered rosy assessments of their platforms during opening statements. But the limited time each member of Congress got to ask questions didn\u2019t allow for much additional explanation from the CEOs, many of whom are used to answering questions with winding speeches full of Silicon Valley platitudes.\n\nRelated: Want to Rank Higher in Google and Amazon Search? This $29 Course Can Help.\n\nMembers on both sides of the aisle had bones to pick with the CEOs. The Democrats largely focused on the antitrust issues at hand: whether Amazon keeps its third-party sellers on a tight leash; if Google favors its own products in search; whether Facebook\u2019s acquisitions served only to thwart competition; and if Apple\u2019s fabled walled-garden approach persists.\n\nSome Republicans did, too, but a few veered off course to quiz the execs on pet projects: Google allegedly discriminating against conservatives; Google pulling out of the Pentagon\u2019s JEDI project; and why a certain member\u2019s campaign emails keep ending up in his father\u2019s spam folder.\n\nThe four-hour-plus hearing covered a lot of ground, and some topics were more interesting than others. Here are some of the highlights.\n\nFacebook\n\nFacebook-Instagram: Illegal Merger or a Savvy Dealmaking?\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) accused Facebook of breaking antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram back in 2012 because it knew Instagram posed a potential threat to its hold over the social media market.\n\n\u201cIn your own words you bought Instagram to neutralize the competitive threat. This was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction,\u201d Nadler claimed, citing internal documents provided by Facebook. \u201cWhy should Instagram not be broken off into a separate company?\u201d\n\nZuckerberg acknowledged he saw Instagram as a competitor, but only in the mobile-photo sharing space. The FTC also scrutinized and approved the acquisition in 2012. \u201cI think with hindsight, it probably looks obvious that Instagram would\u2019ve reached the scale it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\u201d he said, citing other top platforms of the time, like the now-defunct Path.\n\nAccording to Zuckerberg, Instagram\u2019s success is largely due to Facebook\u2019s investment. \u201cI think this has been an American success story,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: Apple, Comcast, Alphabet Among Big Companies Pledging Money to Fight Inequality\n\nNadler disagreed. \u201cRather than compete with [Instagram], Facebook bought it. This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. This should have never happened in the first place,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (Photo by Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nAre You Threatening Me?\n\nNadler and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, (D-Washington), both brought up Zuckerberg\u2019s negotiations with Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom ahead of the merger.\n\n\u201cIn a chat you told Mr. Systrom that Facebook \u2018was developing our own photo strategy, so how we engage now will also determine how much we are partners versus competitors down the line,\u2019\u201d Rep. Jayapal noted. \u201cInstagram\u2019s founder seemed to think that was a threat. He confided in an investor at the time that he feared you would go into \u2018destroy mode\u2019 if he didn\u2019t sell Instagram to you.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg denied it was a threat and characterized his email as a negotiating tactic. \u201cI think it was clear this was a space where we were going to compete in, one way or another,\u201d he said.\n\nPreventing Imminent Risk of Life\n\nTwitter was not present at today\u2019s hearing, but its policies came up nonetheless. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, asked Zuckerberg why it had temporarily banned Donald Trump Jr. this week for sharing a COVID-19 conspiracy theory. Zuckerberg noted that it was Twitter, not Facebook, that took action against the president\u2019s son. But Zuckerberg explained why the move was probably the correct one.\n\nThe video shared by Trump, Jr. featured a doctor who said that hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19, which it does not. So while Facebook allows discussion around trials for drugs or personal experiences with experimental drugs, it does not allow people to definitively state that there is a cure for a disease when there isn\u2019t one, Zuckerberg said.\n\n\u201cIn general...we do not want to be the arbiters of truth,\u201d Zuckerberg continued. But if \u201csomeone is going to go out and say that hydroxychloroquine is proven to clear COVID and that statement could lead people to take a drug \u2026 we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of life.\u201d\n\nLater in the hearing, Pichai agreed with that line of thinking when Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, asked why the video in question was also removed from YouTube.\n\n\u201cWe believe in freedom of expression and there\u2019s a lot of debate on effective ways to deal with COVID. But during a pandemic, we look to local health authorities [and] the CDC for guidelines around medical misinformation and [how it] might cause harm in the real world,\u201d Pichai said.\n\nAmazon\n\nJeff Bezos (Photo by Graeme Jennings-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nNo One Company Should Dominate\n\nQuestions for Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos mainly focused on the company\u2019s relationship with third-party sellers. Last year, Amazon\u2019s general counsel told Congress that Amazon does not scrape data from third-party sellers to develop competing products.

Jayapal, who represents Amazon\u2019s homestate of Washington, argued that such behavior could prevent the next big tech giant from emerging. \u201cThe whole goal of this committee is to make sure there are more Amazons [and] Apples and small businesses get to thrive\u201d; no one company should dominate, she said.\n\nCustomer Service Nightmare\n\nRep. Lucy McBath (D-Georgia) played testimony from a book seller who claims she was delisted from selling on Amazon without any explanation. \u201cAs we grew, we were shrinking Amazon\u2019s market share in the textbooks category,\u201d the unnamed seller said. \u201cSo now in retaliation, Amazon started restricting us from selling.\" According to McBath, the seller messaged Amazon over 500 times, but never got a response.\n\nBezos said: \u201cI don\u2019t even understand what\u2019s going on in that anecdote, because we love for third-party sellers to sell books.\u201d\n\nHowever, McBath said numerous third-party merchants have told the Congressional committee about similar instances involving Amazon undermining their businesses. \u201cThere are more sellers who have exhausted all of their options before finally reaching out to you as last resort. But they are still waiting for your response,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI do not think systematically that\u2019s what\u2019s going on,\u201d Bezos responded, arguing that even allowing third parties on Amazon.com was a \u201cvery controversial decision\u201d 20 years ago. \u201cWe did that because we were convinced it would be better for the consumer. And I think we were right.\n\nRep. David Cicilline (Photo by Graeme Jennings-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, claimed the company was creating an \u201cinherent conflict of interest\u201d with its third-party merchants, especially since \u201cAmazon can set the rules of the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis investigation makes clear that Amazon\u2019s dual role as a platform operator and a competing seller on that platform is fundamentally anti-competitive, and Congress must take action,\u201d Cicilline claimed.\n\nGoogle\n\nSundar Pichai (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / POOL / AFP)\n\nStealing Content\n\nCicilline quizzed Pichai about why it was \u201cstealing content\u201d from businesses to bolster its own and only displaying content in search results that\u2019s most profitable for Google. Not surprisingly, Pichai took issue with that characterization, arguing in part that most product searches originate on Amazon, not Google.\n\nPichai\u2019s style, however, did not really lend itself to the rapid-fire nature of today\u2019s hearing, and he didn\u2019t really get to complete many thoughts before time-limited members were forced to move on.\n\n\u2018Big Tech Is Out to Get Conservatives\u2019\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (Photo by Mandel Ngan-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nRepublicans also took aim at Google, with allegations that it censors conservative viewpoints on Google Search and via YouTube.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll just cut to the chase: Big tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) in his opening statement. He later demanded Google pledge to avoid siding with the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden during the ongoing election.\n\n\u201cCan you assure us today, you are not going to try and silence conservatives?\u201d Jordan asked. Pichai said: \u201cYou have my commitment, it\u2019s always been true. And we\u2019ll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way.\u201d (After the exchange, Rep. Mary Scanlon, a Pennsylvania Democrat, dismissed Jordan\u2019s line of questioning as \u201cfringe conspiracy theories,\u201d prompting a fiery back and forth between both sides of the aisle.)\n\nChina\u2019s Corporate Espionage Playbook\n\nRepublicans also quizzed Pichai about why Google was willing to work with China, but not with the Pentagon?\n\nIn 2018, Google pulled out of a US Defense Department project following internal protests from company employees. It later said it would not allow Google AI technology to be used as a weapon or for surveillance and that it would refuse to develop any AI projects that will \"cause or are likely to cause overall harm.\"\n\nIn the same year, however, news emerged that Google was secretly developing a search engine for China that would not only censor content, but also potentially allow government authorities to track people\u2019s website lookups. Google later abandoned the search engine. But today, Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colorado) questioned whether the company was following \u201cChina\u2019s corporate espionage playbook.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said: \u201cFirst of all we are proud to support the US government,\u201d while citing the company\u2019s recent partnership with the US Defense Department to secure the Pentagon from cyber attacks.\n\n\u201cWe have a very limited presence in China,\u201d Pichai added. \u201cWe don\u2019t offer any of our services\u2014Search, Maps, Gmail, YouTube, etc.\u2014in China.\u201d\n\nApple\n\nTim Cook (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\u2018A Street Fight for Market Share\u2019\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook got off relatively easy during today\u2019s hearing. However, Rep. Henry Johnson (D-Georgia) did grill him about the iOS App Store, the sole way iPhone owners can download mobile apps. (Last month, the European Union launched its own antitrust investigation into the store\u2019s policies.)\n\nCurrently, Apple takes a 30 to 15 percent cut of all in-app purchases on the store. \u201cWhat\u2019s to stop Apple from increasing its commission to 50 percent?\u201d Johnson asked, to which Cook noted that commissions have never increased in the App Store\u2019s 12-year history.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to stop you from doing so, is it?\u201d Johnson then asked.\n\n\u201cNo sir, I disagree strongly with that,\u201d Cook replied. \u201cThere\u2019s a competition for developers, just like there\u2019s a competition for customers.\u201d Those same developers can choose to write apps for other platforms, such as Android, Windows, and Xbox. \u201cSo we have fierce competition on the developer side, and the customer side, which is essentially so competitive, I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business,\u201d Cook said.\n\nHe went on to say that Apple never retaliates or bullies iOS developers for complaining about its policies. However, Johnson said the company still holds sole discretion over which apps get allowed on the iOS App Store. \u201cDevelopers have no choice but to go along with the changes, or they must leave the App Store. That\u2019s an enormous amount of power,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nRep. Cicilline said House Judiciary will publish a report on the Antitrust Subcommittee's finding, which will propose solutions. but \"this hearing has made one fact clear to me: These companies as they exist today have monopoly power.

All need to be properly regulated and held accountable,\" he concluded.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/354012", "author": ["Chloe Albanesius", "Michael Kan"]}, {"title": "Make This Pandemic the Reason You Publish Your First Video", "text": "July 30, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe pandemic has had devastating effects worldwide. You know this. I know this. We all know this. It has affected every area of life for billions of people and, for many of us, doesn\u2019t seem to be ending anytime soon. The sad reality is we all know at least one local business that couldn\u2019t sustain the catastrophic loss and made the heartbreaking decision to close its doors permanently.\n\nDuring this time, we\u2019ve seen many service-based businesses transform day-to-day operations and products, or pivot entirely, in order to survive these darker times. We\u2019ve also witnessed certain industries modify their service and adjust to the circumstances to effectively wait out the storm.\n\nA good example of visible brands who have done their best to modify how they operate would be some of our favorite talk shows, such as The View, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert billed as A Late Show with Stephen Colbert, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah billed as The Daily Social Distancing Show, and Late Night with Seth Meyers. The hosts and their respective production teams have proven once again that in this age of technology all we really need is good internet connection and a little ingenuity.\n\nWhile it\u2019s no secret that many of these show hosts have openly expressed frustration due to limited resources and creative opportunities, not to mention seeing more than a handful of technical difficulties and on-air snafus that would have normally been edited out, this could also serve as a glimmer of inspiration for many small business owners. The reason is, most people think of talk show hosts as being television superstars. But being a star on camera is a heck of a lot easier when you\u2019re on a legit soundstage with an entire team of professionals handling all the technical details. It\u2019s a completely different story when that same person is forced to record from the attic or spare bedroom and has to multitask handling the bulk of operations.\n\nIf these television heavyweights can put together enough content to cover multiple segments spanning anywhere from 20-40 minutes on a daily basis using only their laptops and smart devices coupled with downloadable software and free social media apps; then there\u2019s no excuse for entrepreneurs who are hesitant to use these same readily available tools to communicate with their customers. Starting out, this could be a very simple three-minute delivered on a weekly basis for the purpose of informing customers and building awareness. That\u2019s it. It doesn\u2019t need to be elaborate and this can be easily incorporated into your online marketing strategy.\n\nFor those who have been on the fence with video content creation or have been reluctant to start for one reason or another, then let this worldwide slowdown be the exact opportunity you\u2019ve been waiting for to begin. Time is no longer a factor because the pandemic has afforded most of us more than enough time on our hands. As mentioned above, many nationally recognized and admired talk show hosts have openly shared their previously limited expertise with technology and the need for a crash course in software and social media tools if they had any hope of staying connected with their fans. They\u2019ve also laughed about the many glitches and blunders with their makeshift home studios. If they can do this to reach their millions of viewers nationwide then you can do it to reach the people in your online sphere.\n\nRelated: Connecting With Your Target Audience Through Video\n\nTo help get the ball rolling, let\u2019s focus our attention on three main areas.\n\n1. Choose content that your audience wants to know about.\n\nTake a moment to think about those frequently asked questions that you receive. These could be common questions about your particular service, the industry in general, or typical problems and pain points of your ideal customers. Imagine someone approached you to ask one of these very common questions. How would you respond to address the individual\u2019s concern? More than likely, you\u2019ve answered this question so many times that providing a thought-out response would be second nature. Well, that\u2019s all you\u2019re doing with these informative and content rich videos for your audience. The only difference being that this conversation will be rehearsed and recorded for public consumption.\n\nTypically, I\u2019ll have my clients write down ten frequently asked questions or common problems their customers face. That\u2019s all we need to begin. Once you have these ten key points written down, then it\u2019s time to take a closer look at how you\u2019ll structure and deliver the information.\n\n2. Choose a format that can be easily applied. Here are three basic video styles:\n\nQ&A \u2013 Pose the frequently asked question at the beginning of the video and then provide your expert answer. Be sure to include supporting information for the sake of clarity. Remember your viewer probably doesn\u2019t have your extensive background and knowledge base so keep it simple.\n\nDid You Know \u2013 This informative style can be causal and even conversational as you express your message. You\u2019ve probably started thousands of friendly discussions like this over your lifetime. Use this format to build awareness with your audience.\n\nHow To \u2013 Just as it sounds, this format shows the person how to do something. It may sound counterintuitive because you\u2019re essentially teaching the person how to do something that you would normally be paid to do. But that\u2019s the beauty of it. By doing this, you are teaching the viewer how to do an easier and smaller job, perhaps even one that you wouldn\u2019t have the time to do, which establishes credibility and proves you are an expert because you just solved the problem in front of their eyes. Empowering your audience to learn more about your work establishes trust and builds rapport, plus it increases the likelihood that they will return for more direct assistance when they need help solving those bigger and more complex issues.\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons Why You Need Video in Your Marketing Strategy (With ...\n\n3. Press the red button\n\nThe final piece is to actually record the video. You are the expert. You know the material. Take a deep calming breath and start recording. If you need a small notecard nearby to stay on track, then use it. If you mess up and need to record it again, then keep trying until you\u2019re satisfied with the final product. It doesn\u2019t need to be perfect. It just needs to be professional. Practice makes progress. Like anything in life, the more you do it the better you\u2019ll become. In the beginning the videos might take a little bit longer until you find your flow and delivery style. This will come in time. Stay focused on the objective, which is to create a premium piece of original content that will educate your audience and provide an opportunity to engage in a personal and direct manner.\n\nCreating original content like this allows you to build value and stay connected with your audience. It provides a platform to demonstrate your skills and expertise. You won\u2019t need to tell them that you\u2019re an expert because you\u2019ll be demonstrating your proficiency right in front of them. Actions speak louder than words and this will prove how good you are with every new video published.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem like this pandemic will be going away anytime soon and the medical experts emphasize the need for flexibility and frequent adjustments. But you can use this time to differentiate yourself as a proven leader in your market by creating video content that attracts your ideal customers. Keep the conversation going by engaging with viewers and building your online community. Use this opportunity to turn misfortune into the golden ticket that strengthens your business and keeps customers coming back for more.\n\nRelated: The 8 Most Popular and Effective Uses of Video Marketing", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353803", "author": ["Rich Perry"]}, {"title": "Is Joe Biden's Tax Plan Bad for Business?", "text": "July 30, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWith Tax Day behind us and election campaigning in full swing, many be wondering how the presidential election could change their when filing next year. Former Vice President Joe Biden announced his intention to get rid of President Trump\u2019s $2 trillion tax cut, which if enacted, would have a direct impact on the finances of businesses and .\n\nHere are six components of Biden's plan that business owners should be aware of:\n\n1. Real estate investors will lose tax incentives\n\nInvestors could have many incentives taken away under Biden\u2019s proposed tax plan. Much of his $775 billion \u201ccaring economy\u201d plan will be financed by taxes on real estate investors with incomes of $400,000 and above. This would be done by eliminating the 1031 exchange that allows investors to swap investment properties for another that is \u201clike-kind.\u201d He is also proposing to eliminate bonus depreciation for real estate and intangible drilling cost and depletion deductions for oil and gas development.\n\nRelated: When Will Your Next Stimulus Check Arrive?\n\n2. Capital gains tax will increase\n\nCurrently, the long-term capital gains (assets held longer than a year) tax rate is 20 percent for single households with more than $441,451 in taxable income ($496,601 for married-filing-jointly) in 2020. Under Biden\u2019s proposed plan, he would raise taxes on capital gains by treating them as ordinary income for those earning more than $1 million. In addition, the plan calls to increase the 37 percent ordinary income rate set by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) up to 39.6 percent. That means for those who would pay the top rate in capital gains, their rates would almost double from 23.8 percent to 43.4 percent. One of the biggest impacts would be in the year you sell your business, where your capital gains alone will likely put you over $1 million of taxable income.\n\n3. Corporate income tax rate will jump to 28 percent\n\nTCJA lowered corporate income tax for US resident C-corporations significantly from 35 percent to 21 percent, but Biden\u2019s plan would implement an increase to 28 percent. One way to avoid this increase is to choose the right business entity. By setting up your business as a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC) or S-corporation, you\u2019ll be taxed as a pass-through entity, thus avoiding entity-level tax. In addition, you may qualify for the 20 percent pass-through deduction for small business, lowering your taxes even more. This will also have an impact on planning for the sale of the business using the Section 1202 exclusion.\n\n4. Qualified business income deductions for income above $400,000 will be phased out\n\nThe TCJA provided many owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations a deduction that allowed taxpayers to deduct up to 20 percent of their qualified business income (QBI), plus 20 percent of qualified real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends and qualified publicly traded partnership (PTP) income. Biden\u2019s plan calls to phase out this deduction for income above $400,000, eliminating another great tax benefit for entrepreneurs.\n\nRelated: New Legislation Would Grant Automatic Forgiveness of PPP Loans Under $150,000\n\n5. Incentives for charitable donations could be reduced\n\nWhile the TCJA nearly doubled the standard deduction for single, head of household and married taxpayers, there are still individuals who prefer itemized deductions. Under Biden\u2019s reform, the value of itemized deductions would be limited to 28 percent. Many charities are concerned about this change as they believe it would limit the amount of donations they would receive as it would limit the incentive to make charitable contributions.\n\n6. The cap on social security taxes for income above $400,000 will be eliminated\n\nBiden\u2019s current plan creates a donut hole in Social Security, where everything above the current limit of $137,700 and below $400,000 isn\u2019t taxed and income above $400,000 would be subject to Social Security taxes at 12.4 percent split evenly between employers and employees.\n\nTake the time to understand each candidate\u2019s tax plan and how they will affect your business when considering your decision this election season.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353774", "author": ["Tom Wheelwright"]}, {"title": "The Top Four Mistakes Beginners Make With Their First Facebook Ad Campaign", "text": "July 30, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet started , it\u2019s high time you do. Recent statistics from Hootsuite show that the average Facebook user clicks on 11 ads per month. Although many believe Facebook is on the decline after last year\u2019s privacy violations came under scrutiny, it still makes up for 40 percent of annual digital display advertising revenue, according to the Pew Research Center. That\u2019s second only to one: Google.\n\nWith all the opportunity from a Facebook ad campaign, it\u2019s a preferred avenue for new business owners ready to get exposure for their product. However, as easy as Facebook Ads Manager makes the ad creation process, there\u2019s a great deal of behind-the-scenes work that first needs to be accomplished. In fact, many beginners fall into mistake traps when creating their first campaign. These are the top four most common mistakes to make sure you avoid.\n\nRelated: The Complete Guide to Getting Started With Facebook Ads\n\n1. Slacking on the quality of the creatives and the copy\n\nNowadays, companies that win with ads are those that have the best creative approach. A compelling video, catchy graphic and magnetic copy goes a long way \u2014 it gets potential customers to pay attention. Focus your efforts here first, because if you can\u2019t get a potential customer to stop their scrolling and actually read or engage with the ad, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best product in the world. Each is as important as the other. For example, you could invest in a high-quality, colorful photo shoot for a powerful image, but if the copy is weak, a prospective customer will still scroll past.\n\nFortunately, Facebook also knows how important each component is and made a new tool that helps ad managers and creatives conduct split tests, matching your creatives with your headlines in different combinations. Facebook created Dynamic Creative, in which an ad creator can upload basic parts of their ideal ad (the copy, the images and more), and the system optimizes and tests different combinations for you, as you never fully know how they\u2019ll perform until they\u2019re tested.\n\nSpecifically, testing creative is one of the best ways to boost conversions. According to Nielsen, \u201c49 percent of a brand\u2019s sales lift from advertising is due to the creative.\u201d There are some headlines and video creatives that can generate a few hundred percent more in ROI.\n\nRelated:Don't Even Think About Facebook Ads Until You Have These 5 Things In Place\n\n2. Not knowing your objective\n\nIt\u2019s great if you want to use an ad campaign to spark more awareness about your business or product, but this is really more an implicit consequence of running ads. Get clear on what your main objective is from running them, which is important not only for how you create the ads themselves, but also for what you select as your ad objective on Facebook. This objective determines how the Facebook algorithm shows ads to audiences. If the objective hasn\u2019t been pinpointed, it\u2019s likely that Facebook will deliver the ads to the wrong audience, and you won\u2019t get the results that you were planning on. This is one of the easiest ways to sabotage your ads.\n\nSo, what is the objective of your ad campaign? What do you want your customers to do? Is it subscribing to your mailing list? Actually purchasing a product? Booking a demo appointment? This can also factor into the call-to-action that you place within the ad, as customers sometimes need direction as to what your objectives are, too.\n\nRelated: 5 Forbidden Phrases You Absolutely Must Avoid in Your Facebook Ad\n\n3. Making typos or grammatical errors in ad copy\n\nThis sounds obvious, but double, triple and quadruple check the copy for your ads. Typos are an ad killer. Website Planet conducted an experiment to see just how detrimental the presence of typos can be. It found that while the results differed by country (because of language barriers), in the U.S., marketers pay up to 10 percent more for their ad spend when they have a typo \u2014 and in the U.K., 20 percent more for typos and 72 percent more for grammatical errors.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that we make typos and mistakes all the time in writing quick emails or even in our personal Instagram page captions. How you portray yourself and your company in an ad matters. What would you think of a company that had a very obvious, glaring typo in its ad copy? Would you still buy from it, even if you really were interested in its product or service? Even if it doesn\u2019t matter much to you, it does give many customers pause, because the question becomes: \u201cWhat\u2019s the quality of this company\u2019s work if they can\u2019t double check the writing they invested in?\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Simple Steps to Recover a Disabled Facebook Ads Account\n\n4. Having too broad of a target audience\n\nNot narrowing down your audience targeting enough is another common mistake \u2014 also made from the desire for exposure. It\u2019s understandable: You don\u2019t want to cut off a potential demographic that would be interested. For example, if you\u2019re selling a service that reviews grad school applications, you don\u2019t want to limit your target audience to the typical age range for grad school applicants just in case there are a few stragglers applying earlier or later.\n\nHowever, too broad of a target audience can end up costing you both time and money. Black Tie Marketing noted that one of the surefire ways to know that your target is too broad is by surveying the leads you currently have coming through your funnel. Do you get on a phone call with someone and find out that they actually aren\u2019t a qualified lead more often than not? Or, are you getting good impressions and clicks but little follow through? Niche down, in that case. It may diminish the reach, but if you\u2019re reaching more qualified prospects, it\u2019s worth it \u2014 both for your time and theirs.\n\nMy best advice is to start by investing time and research on that first ad campaign, then tweak from there. Go deep by perfecting the ad, create urgency and a clear action plan for interested leads, get more eyeballs on it to avoid typos or poorly written sentences and make sure you\u2019re targeting the right demographic, even if it\u2019s smaller than you thought.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353892", "author": ["Steve Tan"]}, {"title": "Former Republican Presidential Candidate Herman Cain Has Died After Being Hospitalized for Coronavirus", "text": "July 30, 2020 3 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on Business Insider\n\n\n\nThe former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has died after being hospitalized for the novel .

By 2025, illennials will make up 75 percent of the workforce, and we have already seen companies evolve so they can cater to millennial work values and best retain talent. (Think: remote work, flex time, an empathetic environment, goals aligned with personal values, etc.)\n\nGen Z, born between 1996 and 2010, is just now entering the workforce and is taking cues from their older generational siblings.

More than half (61 percent) think viewing content on a smartphone is just as good as watching through television. That is a big leap from millennials (63 percent), which prefer to view video content on television.\n\nKnowing mobile is a key part of Gen Z\u2019s communication and content-consumption styles, look to mobile trends, apps that boost efficiency through mobile and ways to make your own website and processes mobile friendly.\n\nThe future of work is here \u2014 at Entrepreneur NEXT, we\u2019re building a smarter way to hire top experts. Save yourself the wasted time typically spent in boring interviews or unnecessary agency pitches \u2014 we\u2019ll take care of the hiring details for you.\n\nEncourage collaboration and interaction.\n\nHuman interaction is big with Gen Z. Surprisingly, the most technologically literate generation actually prefers face-to-face interaction in the workplace, and sees it as more effective than digital-communication tools.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they are averse digital-collaboration averse. They utilize tools like Google Docs, Slack, Microsoft Teams and more to increase collaborative efforts. An Indiana University study found that by using collaborative tools, student satisfaction increased and absenteeism dropped by 50 percent.\n\nGen Z is also the most diverse generation entering the workforce, and that translates to how they prefer their work environments. Out of Gen Z workers, 48 percent are non-caucasian, which helps bring diverse perspectives to the workforce, increasing creativity and innovation. Gen Z values diverse collaboration in a team environment, with 20 percent believing the most important part of a team is diverse cultural perspectives.\n\nOffer room for curiosity.\n\nA very curious generation is entering the workforce. Gen Z is more likely to explore new skills and is hungry for feedback along the way, with 97 percent receptive to regular feedback on their work.To Gen Z, \u201cregular feedback\u201d means a check-in every couple of weeks. For millennials, they prefer feedback at half the rate. When it comes to being managed, 43 percent of Gen Z enjoy a self-directed approach to learning, and 77 percent of them prefer having a millennial manager.\n\nWhat all this means is companies need to foster environments that give employees space to explore and grow their skills, opportunities to learn from their mistakes, and a team environment that values diverse voices.\n\nLike their millennial predecessors, Gen Z is looking for a healthy work-life balance. Burned-out employees are 63 percent more likely to take sick days and three times more likely to leave their job. With seven in 10 millennials experiencing professional burnout, and Gen Z has been watching and taking measures for their own well being.\n\nProvide them with value \u2014 professionally and financially.\n\nWhile Gen Z wants fulfillment in their work, they also want to get paid. Like millennials, Gen Z is concerned about stagnant wages and increasing cost of living expenses like healthcare, housing, student debt and more. The biggest motivators for Gen Z to perform in the workplace are financial incentive and career advancement.\n\nGrowing up, this generation witnessed an economic depression that affected either their families or families they know. They heard horror stories of millennials entering full-time jobs and needing a \u201cside hustle\u201d just to earn enough money to pay necessities. In fact, a 2019 Bankrate survey found 49% of adults 35 and younger have a side hustle and one out of three people who take on a side hustle does so to survive.\n\nSeeing the effects of an economic depression played out during childhood, Gen Z is more likely to take financial precautions. For example, 35 percent plan to get a retirement plan in order during their 20s.\n\nIn order to solidify financial security, Gen Z takes skill-building and professional development seriously in order to advance in career and salary. Growing up digital, these employees understand how technology\u2019s fast-paced nature requires adaptation and skill-building in order to succeed in their careers. Main motivators for Gen Z workers to learn are to improve their job, make money and get promoted - all aligning with the professional and financial value they seek in a career.\n\nWith technology evolving at such a fast pace and a new generation of workers entering their careers, one of the best ways to stay on top of the future of work is to observe how Gen Z works. Ask questions, learn their habits and think about how your company can best implement these trends to increase employee retention and stay ahead of the curve.\n\nForget the large agency fees, complicated contracts, and other BS involved with hiring experts by yourself.

He was speaking to a nation struggling with what was just the beginning of what we now know as the Great Depression. The statement is not completely true since there are plenty of other things to fear, including sharks, taxes and global pandemics. But this much is an absolute fact \u2014 especially for entrepreneurs \u2014 fear can lead to unwise decisions, which can bring about the very negative consequences we wish to avoid. There is indeed much to fear about fear itself. Here are 11 ways to overcome fear during the current crisis or the next one you experience.\n\n1. Name the fear\n\nWhen faced with a crisis and paralyzing fear, the most difficult obstacle in your path may be admitting you are afraid. It\u2019s only once we recognize the reality of the situation that we can deal with it.\n\nOne way to better identify your fear is to imagine the worst that can happen. In her New York Times bestseller Insight, author Tasha Eurich shares a recommendation made by decision psychologist Gary Klein, who advocates a \u201cpre-mortem\u201d for major decisions. The idea is to imagine yourself one year in the future and that everything has gone wrong. Your plans are a total disaster. Then write what that would look like. You might find out the worst that can happen isn\u2019t all that bad, or that you can identify steps to avoid the pitfalls that would lead to disaster.\n\nIn Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl quoted Spinoza\u2019s Ethics, which said: \u201cEmotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.\u201d Or to put it another way, Mr. Rogers said, \u201cAnything that\u2019s human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting and less scary. The people we trust with that important talk can help us know that we are not alone.\u201d\n\nDr. Benjamin Hardy, an organizational psychologist and the author of Personality Isn\u2019t Permanent, shared these quotes with me and then told me, \u201cThe key to overcoming fear is giving it form.\u201d Hardy says this can be done through journaling and open conversation. \"Daily journaling about how you\u2019re feeling, in addition to sharing your feelings with key people in your life, make your emotions manageable.\u201d\n\nHardy says, \u201cDoes this take courage? Absolutely. But it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s worth not being bogged down by fear and needless suffering. When you are open and honest as a person, life becomes far more manageable. You stop needlessly suffering internally about unfulfilled dreams or former hurts. You move forward. And that\u2019s the freaking key! Moving forward! Moving forward as powerfully and authentically as possible.\u201d\n\nRelated: 8 Powerful Phrases Leaders Need to Say in a Time of Crisis\n\n2. Use fear to fuel your courage\n\nThe Japanese poet Kenji Miyazawa said, \u201cWe must embrace pain and consume it for fuel on our journey.\u201d During a crisis, you may hear others say, \u201cNobody can get funded right now,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s time to survive, forget about growth.\u201d Instead, entrepreneurs like Bryan Brandenburg, founder and chief scientist of visualization company Zenerchi, says, \u201cThat\u2019s when I go into warrior mode. Don\u2019t follow the conventional wisdom. It comes from people who are afraid to act or are acting from a place of fear. Instead, look for the opportunities caused by others\u2019 fear.\u201d Or, as Warren Buffet says about how to invest successfully, \u201cBe fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful.\u201d\n\n3. Remember the past\n\nWhen faced with a worrying future, it often pays to think about how we overcame challenges in the past. When thinking of what could be lost, Melinda Dransfield, VP of sales performance elevation for Prudential Retirement, asks, \u201cHave I lost this or something like it before? How did I deal with it before?\u201d and then reminds herself, \u201cI have been through hard things before.\u201d\n\nI started my in 1999, just before the dot-com bubble burst. Less than two years later, the economy went into another downturn after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Then there was the 2008 real estate crisis. Now, whenever the business faces difficult circumstances, I tell myself, \u201cYou\u2019ve been here before,\u201d and even if I\u2019m not sure exactly how, I know we\u2019ll get through it.\n\n4. Think past the crisis\n\nImagining a terrible future can help us avoid that future, but what if things work out great? In an April 2020 article in Harvard Business Review, Mark W. Johnson and Josh Suskewicz share perspectives from their book Lead from the Future. They say that though we must take care of the here and now, we can\u2019t lose sight of the bigger picture. Whatever the future holds, they say, \u201cYou need to begin preparing for it now. And to do that right, you need to have a longer-term vision of what you aspire to become in five or even 10 years \u2014 a north star that will focus and help shape your thinking about the short- and mid-term.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m reminded of how I learned to mow straight lines across a large lawn by focusing on a point in the distance, rather than the ground in front of me. Even if I ran into bumps along the way, as long as I kept my eye on that point, when I finished I could look back and see a straight path. Take care of the short term, but keep an eye on what\u2019s to come or you\u2019ll find it difficult to avoid getting pulled in multiple directions.\n\nRelated: You Can't Do Everything, and If You Try to You'll Do Even Less\n\n5. Invest in \u201calive time\u201d\n\nYour business may not be in danger of going under, but perhaps you find yourself with a lot of spare time. Ryan Holiday, author of multiple bestselling books like The Obstacle Is the Way and Ego Is the Enemy, recalls advice he got about such times from another bestselling author, Robert Green (The 48 Laws of Power). \u201cHe told me there are two types of time: alive time and dead time,\u201d Holiday wrote in a recent blog post. \u201cOne is when you sit around, when you wait until things happen to you. The other is when you are in control, when you make every second count, when you are learning and improving and growing.\u201d\n\nCould you use the extra time your business has to retool your systems, train your team, or build new products and services?\n\n6. Build your fear muscle\n\nThink of fear like gravity: With the proper equipment, it can help you become stronger. Noah Kagan, \u201cChief Sumo\u201d at AppSumo.com, likes \u201cthe coffee challenge,\u201d in which you ask for 10 percent off your next purchase. Awkward? Difficult? Scary? That\u2019s the point. Do it repeatedly and it will get easier, not because the task itself is any easier, but because you\u2019ve become stronger.\n\nJia Jiang took this to the ultimate level when he decided to intentionally get rejected 100 times in 100 days. He was inspired after his first attempt at entrepreneurship ended in rejection, leaving Jia emotionally crushed. However, after he recognized his fear of rejection was harming him more than the actual rejection, he decided to embrace rejection in order to become more comfortable with it. His experiences not only helped him become almost immune to rejection but also led to a TED talk on rejection that has been viewed over 6 million times and the bestselling book Rejection Proof.\n\n7. Reevaluate what makes you unique\n\nIn a crisis, it\u2019s easy to lose focus on your business and why it exists and instead get trapped into concerns about next week\u2019s payroll. Of course, short-term concerns are important, but if we focus on them too much we may miss opportunities. \u201cGet very clear on your point of view,\u201d advises Steve Watt, VP of marketing at Grapevine6. \u201cFigure out why (and for whom) your approach offers a way forward in difficult times.\u201d You may have a new customer segment that suddenly cares about your company\u2019s offering in a way they didn\u2019t before.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Zoom, the video conferencing service, in the early months of 2020. As the Covid-19 virus sent tens of millions of students and workers home, Zoom found itself perfectly positioned to help them stay connected. Through outreach (and a healthy dose of word of mouth) Zoom grew from 10 million to daily users in December 2019 to over 300 million daily users by April 2020.\n\nIn a crisis, you can combat fear as you find your new niche and let others know how you can solve their problems.\n\nRelated: How Entrepreneurs Can Find Clarity in Uncertain Times\n\n8. Identify what you can \u2014 and can\u2019t \u2014 control\n\n\u201cFear isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s the crippling uncertainty that comes with it that eats at us,\u201d says Zachary Zimmerman, senior account manager at marketing agency Number Six. To combat that uncertainty, Zimmerman sorts out which aspects of a challenge he has control over and which he doesn\u2019t. This reduces the uncertainty and allows him to focus on what he can change without wasting time on what he can\u2019t.\n\n9. See fear positively\n\nFear isn\u2019t all bad \u2014 sometimes fear keeps us safe from real harm. Fear can also give us motivation. \u201cFear can be a very positive emotion when it sparks in us the behavior required to overcome, and when we are confident in where we are going,\u201d says Andy Cindrich, senior consultant at FranklinCovey.\n\n10. Find the opportunity\n\nMarcus Sheridan\u2019s experience shows why it\u2019s so important to see every moment, even a crisis, as an opportunity. In 2008, the real estate crisis hit, and Sheridan was in the swimming pool business. Despite occupying a market in which many people were worried about losing their homes (not buying new pools), Sheridan saw that pool builders weren't using the internet to answer buyers' questions. He started answering those questions online, and his company\u2019s website became the Wikipedia of swimming pool information. Now his company is the fastest growing fiberglass swimming pool manufacturer in the world.\n\n\u201cWhen Covid-19 hit and I realized that it was going to get ugly, once again my thoughts immediately shifted,\u201d Sheridan says. \u201cI told myself, \u2018Marcus, commit now to find the opportunity in this moment.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn just a few months, Sheridan\u2019s company introduced a virtual sales methodology to its team of dealers all over the country and experienced tremendous success. Despite the pandemic-related economic downturn, in April 2020 Sheridan\u2019s company broke every sales record it has ever had.\n\nRelated: How Three Different Tech Companies Are Tackling the Common Fight Against Coronavirus\n\n11. Don\u2019t give up\n\nAs a senior sales executive, Hunter Sebresos was present for a meeting in which investors were preparing to shut down the company he was working for. However, he knew their customers had a need, so rather than throwing up his hands and trying to find a new job, he came up with a new business model on the spot, pitched it to the investors right then and there, and won funding to create Bacon, a mobile app that allows companies to post details about their temporary staffing jobs straight from their phones and quickly fill positions, rather than spending days or weeks with a staffing or temp agency.\n\nYour company may be on the brink, but is there a way to pivot that gives you a second chance?\n\nThere is always hope\n\nNo matter how bad things get, there\u2019s always hope for a better future. Even at the height of the Great Depression, the unemployment rate was 24.9 percent \u2014 alarming, but it means that 75.1 percent were still employed. Many of the greatest companies of all time were founded during times of great economic challenges. A short list includes Procter & Gamble, IBM, General Electric, General Motors, FedEx, Hyatt, IHOP, Disney, HP, Microsoft, Burger King, CNN and Apple (twice, first during the downturn in 1975, and then when it was resurrected from near-death during the dot-com crash of 2001).\n\nThere may be a global crisis right now, and there are certainly others brewing, but even in a crisis \u2014 especially during a crisis \u2014 there are people out there who need what you have, and there may be no better time to get busy giving it to them.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/350196", "author": ["Josh Steimle"]}, {"title": "Can Psychedelics Help Treat Depression?", "text": "July 24, 2020 1 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nCan psychedelics treat ?

Traditional gyms full of bulky equipment and machines were losing their appeal as people began to embrace smaller, niche fitness studios, personal trainers and even virtual experiences.\n\nWhile the shift may mean trouble for large brands, it is great news for independent fitness instructors who are now not only finding more freedom to work directly with clients, but also to build their own thriving, profitable businesses without the overhead of a corporation.\n\nAfter his own experience with a personal trainer, Eddie Zhang saw this firsthand. He also noticed that the options for instructors to find a good location to train clients outside of a large gym were lacking. So, in 2009, he decided to leave his role as a tax consultant at the IRS and set out to create spaces for instructors to meet and train their clients. And come 2014, Traing Grounds Gym was born.\n\nThe model he created operates like a salon for trainers. He currently has a set of training pods that trainers rent to use with clients. Each pod has a set of equipment that trainers can use for their sessions so they benefit from the materials a typical gym would provide, but with a fraction of the overhead to use them. \u201cI rent them out to trainers, they run their own gym,\u201d says Zhang.\n\nRelated: #7 on the Franchise 500: Planet Fitness Knows You Don't Want to Go to the Gym\n\nBut Zhang is more than just a landlord. He spends a lot of time coaching and mentoring his trainers to help them be successful, providing them with marketing insights, advice and other to help grow and manage their business.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re making six figures or two, you want to start off running your business the right way,\" he explains. \"Number one, I show them the right business model that\u2019s not going to soak up all their time, and that way they don\u2019t have to change it later on down the road,\u201d said Zhang.\n\nSo when new trainers come to use his space, he talks to them about their business model, specifically encouraging them to follow these four critical steps to growing their income to six figures.\n\n1. Specialize\n\nHow do you stand out in a sea of fit, experienced trainers and attract new clients? You offer a specialized service. Either a type of training, addressing problem areas, preparing for milestone events from marathons to a wedding or even specializing by age groups and gender.\n\nOne of the coaches who runs his business out of Training Grounds branded himself as \u201cDoctor Glutes.\" His business is no different than any other coach; he works with a variety of clients who have different goals, including men, but his marketing around stronger and bigger glutes would first get potential prospect\u2019s attention.\n\n2. Market Results, Not Processes\n\nAnother piece of advice Zhang provides trainers he meets with is to focus on the end result. He notes that so often when trainers first start their businesses, they focus too much on the process and the technique or the physical location where training is going to happen.\n\n\u201cIf you focus too much on the process, then you don\u2019t give yourself any room to adapt to changing needs or circumstances,\" he says. \"But if you focus on selling the end result, you can adapt to fit whatever changes and still end up with a happy client.\u201d\n\n3. Find Your Tools\n\nMost trainers aren\u2019t spending much time sitting at a desk in an office every day. They are out on the floor working with their clients. But, as independent business owners, they need to create systems to make sure they don\u2019t double book themselves and to ensure that all of the work they are putting in results in payment. So often, new business owners \u2014 not just trainers \u2014 realize this too late, perhaps after they\u2019ve gone weeks without payment or forgotten to track which clients have paid and which haven\u2019t.\n\nFortunately, there are now some phenomenal tools on the market, including mobile apps, that make it easier to run a business than ever before. The trick is just to find the right one for you.\n\n4. Build Community\n\nTrainer Kaylin Pyles decided to focus on working with women in the 25-35 age range, and what she offers is more than just fitness; she provides her clients with an entire community to support their goals.\n\nWhen a new client signs up, Pyles adds them to the online community, encouraging other members to welcome the new person. The online community provides her clients with extra accountability and friendship within the community. But it also helps Kaylin run her business more efficiently. Members often answer each other's own questions in the channel so they don't necessarily have to be online all day, answering questions or providing extra words of encouragement. In just a few months, Pyles has moved from making an hourly wage at a gym to pulling in a healthy, six-figure salary, all while doing what she loves and working for herself.\n\nRelated: 5 of the Best Fitness Franchises You Can Buy\n\nZhang's final piece of advice applies to anyone starting or running a business: \u201cWe are always in control over our own destiny. The one thing that we can control is what we do. Even though the economy might be a little on the downward trend, there are still people out there looking for things. There are 330 million people in the United States, which means a lot of potential clients.\u201d", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353789", "author": ["Chinwe Onyeagoro"]}, {"title": "Ellen, Just Apologize Already", "text": "July 30, 2020 3 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nBy now you're probably familiar with the Ellen DeGeneres controversy.\n\nIn case you\u2019re not, here\u2019s a quick recap. According to some reports, at least one current and as many as 10 former members of her popular talk show's staff say that they were victims of \"bullying and racism.\" During the pandemic, the show's production company was accused of underpaying certain staffers. Even before that, rumors were circulating that the comedian was \"notoriously one of the meanest people alive.\"\n\nTrue? Not true? Unfair? It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s 2020!\n\nThe finger-pointing has reached such a level that the show's parent company, WarnerMedia, has launched an internal investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, many senior executives associated with the show are denying any wrongdoing. \u201cOver the course of nearly two decades, 3,000 episodes and employing over 1,000 staff members, we have strived to create an open, safe and inclusive work environment, the show's executive producers said in a joint statement. \"We are truly heartbroken and sorry to learn that even one person in our production family has had a negative experience. It\u2019s not who we are and not who we strive to be, and not the mission Ellen has set for us.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is 2020 The Worst Year Ever?\n\nRight now, the problem isn't about the alleged mistreatment of employees. The problem is all about Ellen DeGeneres. Sure, she may be just the host of the show, but she's the show. Her name's on the title. She has equity in the production. She's the business owner and the face of the brand. So where is she? Why hasn't she said anything publicly about this? Should she? Would you?\n\nShe should. Pay attention, business owners.\n\nEllen needs to make a public apology. She should say how serious the matter is and that she stands fully behind the investigation. She should also state that if any wrongdoing has been found, actions will be taken. She should also publicly state that she was unaware of any wrongdoing (assuming this is the case) but takes full responsibility as the owner of the show. She should do this in a video message, not in writing, because video can better convey her sentiment. There\u2019ll be a media tidal wave that she will have to endure. And then the wave will pass.\n\nIn this day and age, where people and brands get tried and convicted in the court of public opinion well before they reach the court of public law, there is only one proven strategy for companies \u2014 big and small \u2014 to fix a public-relations problem. It\u2019s an apology.\n\nAirlines do it. Hospitals do it. Automakers do it. Retailers do it. Even Kanye did it. It doesn\u2019t matter what the circumstances were. In 2020, people don\u2019t really care about the facts. We\u2019ve learned that facts can be manipulated to meet just about any point of view. The public simply wants to perceive their business leaders and role models as human, and there\u2019s nothing more human than messing up, and then apologizing for it. As for the financial repercussions, we\u2019ll let the insurance companies deal with that.\n\nRelated: Why Did Milton Berle Get Banned From 'SNL'?\n\nSo Ellen: Apologize.

Businesses have closed en masse, gutting certain industries and leaving millions of Americans without jobs. More than 40 million people \u2014 over a quarter of the work force \u2014 have filed unemployment claims since March.\n\nAs we face these scary prospects and the long, unknown financial road ahead of us, many people reflect on the most recent major economic downturn, the Great Recession of more than a decade ago. Although the Recession officially spanned December 2007 to June 2009, it took several more years for employment and the economy to stabilize to previous levels. It marked the largest economic crisis of our lifetime.\n\nMany people are familiar with the quote, \u201cThose who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\" Regardless of what the future holds, it is important for us to look at the business successes and failures from the most recent financial crisis and learn from that challenging time. Here are five lessons we learned from the Recession that are still true in 2020:\n\n1. Diversify your customer base.\n\nOne of the most common recommendations from financial planners to people managing the stock market is to have a diversified portfolio of investments. That is, to have a mix of investments in different areas and yields, which limits the potential for financial distress that comes from a single failed asset or risk. That is also true for businesses and their customer bases.\n\nIf a company has only one or two segments of customers, regardless of how successful it may be at the time, that can be a risky venture. It is best to have diversified income streams and establish multiple industries and types of customers that can be serviced. That way, the business will continue to exist if any of them go away.\n\n2. Strengthen your operating systems.\n\nOne of the key factors for businesses that survived the recession is that they had a strong operating system. This is not just from the franchisor, but having franchisees who implement the system in an effective way. These are the people who understand how the numbers work and how to run the business in an efficient way.\n\nThis is why franchisees with strong operating systems survive downturns while weaker franchisees or mom-and-pop businesses often do not. It is not just about having the system in place, but people with a good knowledge of the system who can effectively implement it.\n\n3. Cash is king.\n\nIt is fine to use debt to get into a business and it can be a common practice. However, it is important to preserve cash and reduce debt as soon as possible. Too much leverage in an economic downturn is a problem.\n\nThe people who were successful during the recession were those who were not overly leveraged. When a business owner makes money, one of the things they will want to do is to reduce their debt load as quickly and effectively as possible.\n\n4. Always be prepared.\n\nWe don\u2019t know many things about the future, but we can predict it will be different than the present. Those who went through the recession ten years ago and may be struggling now should find solace in knowing the situation will eventually improve. Meanwhile, some people who felt business couldn\u2019t be better in 2006 may have been upended just a few years later. The key is never to get complacent and fail to think about the future.\n\nBusiness owners should be prepared for what is coming next, even if they don\u2019t know what that will be. To a certain extent, they need to be worried about it so they do not become comfortable where they are. Like a good chess player, they should anticipate a move a step or two ahead of time. It is important to have a contingency plan and be flexible in how to respond.\n\nA great example of how to anticipate and react to change can be seen in the book Who Moved My Cheese by Spencer Johnson. The story follows the journey of four characters in search of their favorite food in a twisted maze. It is a metaphor about the ongoing search for what we want in life and the many changes we will face along the way. The main message is that change is inevitable and that we must learn to accept it, adapt to it and embrace it.\n\n5. Seize the opportunity.\n\nDuring difficult times, whether it was a decade ago or in the present day, I have seen people panic and think the sky is falling. This is often the mindset of the weaker players, and they ultimately don\u2019t survive.\n\nContrast that to others who look at the situation as one of opportunity. This becomes a time of less competition and a greater chance to consolidate ownership in a marketplace. There are new advantages, such as cheaper real estate and more available employees that were not possible just six months ago. You will see larger, stronger franchisees buyout out the weaker ones and positioning themselves for greater success in the future.\n\nWarren Buffett said, \u201cSomeone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.\u201d This is the time where people start planting trees. There are currently some available opportunities and over time those trees grow. They may not immediately enjoy the fruits of their labor, but at a certain point in the future, they will be sitting in the shade.\n\nThere are many valuable lessons we learned ten years ago. It is important to remember these examples as we move forward in the current situation.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/351647", "author": ["Rick Bisio"]}, {"title": "KFC to 3D Print Chicken Using Lab-Grown 'Meat of the Future'", "text": "July 20, 2020 3 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on PC Mag\n\n\n\nNobody does chicken\u2014or food innovation\u2014like .

Would clarity and persuasion help you attract more clients, investors, mentors and sales? To maximize success in conversation, ensure you are following Grice\u2019s maxims.\n\nTwentieth-century British philosopher Paul Grice shifted the way we think about semantics and language. His maxims for conversation are part of his work on the cooperative principle, which states that when people engage with one another there are unspoken assumptions around how the conversation will unfold. Research tells us that we grasp the nuances of Grice\u2019s maxims from an early age; a 2015 study found that children as young as six years old could distinguish the presence or absence of all of the maxims when listening to someone speak.\n\nTranslation: When decision-makers listen to you, they are already filtering your words through these four maxims, and if you step out-of-bounds on one or more of them, you\u2019ll have a hard time winning over your listener. Clarity is critical, particularly in high-stakes conversations like an investor pitch, and you don\u2019t want all your hard work to go down the drain because your vision is too difficult to follow when you talk about it.\n\nRelated: 5 Mistakes Entrepreneurs Make When Pitching Their Ideas to Investors\n\nAs a ghostwriter and copywriter who teaches entrepreneurs to write faster, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how following a framework can multiply an entrepreneur\u2019s financial results. Let\u2019s dig into each of Grice\u2019s four maxims in more detail and learn how you can use them to capture anyone\u2019s attention on command.\n\n1. Say what is needed and nothing more\n\nThe maxim of quantity states that excess information will ultimately clutter your story or position. Ever check out of a conversation because the person talking keeps going off on tangents? Gatekeepers will do the same to you if you overstuff them with detail; give me whatever context I need to really understand the situation and nothing more.\n\nThis is why you should be sharpening your elevator pitch all the time. A pitch forces you to blend storytelling with value and land your point in a succinct way. In my work assisting entrepreneurs with messaging, the elevator pitch is often the most challenging type of communication for a professional because it requires restraint and precision.\n\nA good rule of thumb for editing is to ask yourself \u201cSo what?\u201d at the end of each sentence or story detail. If your language doesn\u2019t actually propel your message forward, leave it out.\n\nRelated: 13 Tips on How to Deliver a Pitch Investors Simply Can't Turn Down\n\n2. Back up what you say\n\nIf your listener has to spend precious moments wondering whether the words you speak are true, their attention is being diverted from your message. Grice\u2019s maxim of quality has two components: Tell the truth, and back up what you say with evidence, preferably scientific in nature.\n\nIn a world of misinformation and content overload, science, statistics and other proven examples can help you reinforce a position. But as data editor Mona Chalabi mentioned in a 2018 NPR interview, listeners can actually feel alienated by statistics if they don\u2019t have sufficient context.\n\nAccording to this maxim, the natural disposition of a listener is to corroborate your argument in some way; anticipate this skepticism and you\u2019ll do a better job holding someone\u2019s rapt attention.\n\nRelated: Avoid These 7 Mistakes When Pitching Your Business\n\n3. Keep it relevant\n\nGary Vaynerchuk points out that while \u201ccontent is king,\u201d context is God. It\u2019s true; you can barrage your listener with anecdotes or tangents, but will sleek catchphrases and one-liners really add to your conversation or argument in the long run?\n\nGrice\u2019s maxim of relevance states that the most potent pitches, speeches and arguments are those whose subject matter is highly relevant. Companies have already picked up on these consumer semantics and adjusted accordingly, which is why customization was the No. 1 marketing trend for the second year in a row this year. (And what could be more relevant to someone than having a product with their own name on it? This is what made Coca-Cola\u2019s recent customization campaign wildly successful.)\n\nRelated: 10 Questions to Answer Before Pitching Investors\n\n4. Stay organized as you speak\n\nGrice\u2019s final maxim asks us to \u201cbe perspicuous,\u201d which means to be clear and easy to understand. This maxim refers more to your actual word choices; the more muddled your language, the harder it becomes to follow you.\n\nRun your next personal anecdote through these four sub-maxims to ensure you\u2019ll be memorable:\n\nAvoid obscure expressions. A fancy vocabulary might make you more descriptive and feel smarter, but flowery language actually sets you back when it comes to keeping someone\u2019s attention. Also keep industry jargon to a minimum.\n\nAvoid ambiguity. Who is your target audience? Tailor your conversational details to whomever is listening. The riches are in the niches.\n\nKeep it brief. Grice refers to this sub-maxim as prolixity, which is a fancy way to remind you to keep it short and to the point. Details create vividness, but if there\u2019s a way to deliver all the information needed in fewer total words, err on the side of brevity.\n\nStay orderly. When I help entrepreneurs write faster, we spend a lot of time focusing on outlines in order to work out logic and flow. The same applies for speaking. As soon as your listener\u2019s brain has to overthink or work harder, their emotional brain gets overtaken by other parts of the brain responsible for information processing. We want to keep listeners in their emotional brain for as long as possible, because people act and buy on emotion. Flow and order actually create more emotion for your listeners, not less.\n\nThe good news is that most people are wired to listen and filter for these maxims automatically. Stay in bounds, keep your message clear and to the point, and you\u2019ll have everything you need to captivate listeners the next time you have an important audience.\n\nRelated: The Fine Art of Client Pitching", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353250", "author": ["Nick Wolny"]}, {"title": "How to Craft An Elevator Pitch That Gives People Chills in Under 20 Seconds", "text": "July 2, 2020 12 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou are more than likely familiar with Entrepreneur\u2019s popular show \"Elevator Pitch,\" in which pitch their company to a board of investors during a 60-second elevator ride. If the investors like the pitch, the elevator doors open and the entrepreneur is invited into the board room to potentially make a deal.\n\nThis show\u2019s premise is of course inspired by concept that people in business have embraced for decades now: that a truly good idea can be summed up in the span of an elevator ride.\n\nBut this poses a significant dilemma. As an entrepreneur, you\u2019ve likely been toiling away at your idea for some time, possibly even years. How are you supposed to cram all of the value you\u2019ve created in so little time? And if you\u2019re making a pitch in order to attract investments, how can you describe your work in a compelling way, while demonstrating viability in the marketplace, while asking for capital?\n\nYou may be surprised to find out that there is a way you can craft your elevator pitch to not only create greater interest in your product or service, but actually give people chills in under twenty seconds.\n\nRelated: Here's What It's Like to Be on 'Elevator Pitch'\n\nHow people usually do elevator pitches\n\nAmong those who put thought into their elevator pitches, there tends to be two basic formulas:\n\nFormula A: Introduce oneself and the name of the company, then describe the product or service in the context of the customer or industry\u2019s pain point. Then, at the end, make the ask.\n\nFormula B: Identify the pain point before introducing oneself and the name of the company. Then describe the product or service, followed by the ask.\n\nWhile I\u2019m adamant that the only hard and fast rule of communication is that there are no hard and fast rules, I favor Formula B. People are most likely to embrace a solution when it\u2019s provided within the context of a problem they care about solving. By starting with a pain point, the entrepreneur is speaking to what an uninformed audience cares about right away thus making sure that the first thing their audience hears has intrinsic value to them. This helps the audience become immediately invested in solving the problem, which helps the entrepreneur to build some momentum.\n\nWhat further helps with this momentum is identifying a hole in the marketplace. Sometimes this hole is defined by a new need as dictated by circumstance (e.g. the invention and commercialization of the Internet led to a sudden need for accessing it), while other times it\u2019s defined by the inadequacy of existing solutions (e.g. introducing broadband Internet connectivity as a superior alternative to dial-up). Still other times the hole is defined by a problem that the audience doesn\u2019t actually know they have (e.g. how to access the Internet without wires when the marketplace was introduced to Wi-Fi).\n\nWhat all of these different holes have in common, however, is that they are highlighting the typical solutions that don\u2019t work \u2014 or that don\u2019t work as well. This helps the entrepreneur to build momentum because it highlights why the pain point is as powerful as it is \u2014 why it\u2019s seemingly so hard to make that pain go away.\n\nHowever, there is one ingredient that nearly every entrepreneur overlooks. It can redefine not only elevator pitches, but presentations, speeches, webinars, articles, and even books.\n\nAnd this ingredient can make your captive audience in that elevator get chills in twenty seconds or less.\n\nRelated: Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch Season 4 Episode 1: 'You Attacked Me!'\n\nAn example from an unlikely source\n\nYou may remember the 2011 film Moneyball, starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Based on a true story, Pitt plays the general manager of the Oakland Athletics in 2002. His and Hill\u2019s characters implement a fundamentally different approach to building a Major League Baseball team, and eventually win twenty games in a row, the most consecutive wins in the American League at that time. What is perhaps most significant about their season, though, is how they tied the New York Yankees for the most wins in the American League with a roster that cost a small fraction of the New York roster.\n\nToward the beginning of the film, Hill gives a little speech to Pitt that can be considered an elevator pitch of sorts \u2014 he has a short amount of time to capture Pitt's attention.\n\nHill explains to Pitt that there is an \u201cepidemic failure\u201d in how the leaders in most Major League teams manage their teams. He explains that by filling their rosters with expensive star players, they are fundamentally misunderstanding what it takes to have a winning ball club.\n\nWhere the conversation becomes interesting, though, is that he then describes this flawed approach as baseball clubs\u2019 desire to buy players. He states that the point shouldn\u2019t be to buy players, the point should be to buy wins. And to get wins one needs to get runs.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t take a half-hour, an hour, or even longer to explain a complex system of economics and baseball so as to make sure that Pitt\u2019s character is as informed about this approach as possible.\n\nInstead, he distills the approach down to a single nugget of truth:\n\nBaseball teams will win not when they buy players, but when they buy runs.\n\nThis distilled, essential truth is what I call a \u201csilver bullet\u201d \u2014 a statement that conveys the whole of a solution, idea, or innovation in a single, power-packed sentence.\n\nSilver bullets throughout history\n\nNotably, silver bullets have shown up throughout history for thousands of years. Arguably, the most memorable passage in Sun Tzu\u2019s The Art of War is line 18 of the first chapter: \u201cAll of warfare is deception.\u201d If you were to look up Aristotle on sites like Brainy Quote or Good Reads, you will notice that a large portion of his most famous quotes are silver bullets. This includes quotes such as \u201cThe aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but rather their inward significance.\u201d\n\nWe can cite modern examples as well. Some of the most highlighted passages in Kindle editions of non-fiction books are silver bullets. This includes what author Ed Catmull writes in his New York Times bestselling book Creativity Inc.: \u201cGetting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the ideas right\u201d which as of this writing has over 7,600 highlights. In his wildly successful book Sapiens, author Yuval Noah Harari writes that \u201clarge numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths,\u201d a silver bullet that as of this writing has over 29,000 highlights.\n\nFurther still, silver bullets show up in the most popular TED and TEDx talks. TED speaker Dan Pink once gave a talk on \u201cThe puzzle of motivation,\u201d and as of this writing has nearly 26 million views. His silver bullet states that \u201cThe secret to high performance isn\u2019t rewards and punishments but that unseen intrinsic drive\u2026the drive to do things cause they matter.\u201d And Simon Sinek\u2019s famous TEDx talk \u201cHow great leaders inspire action\u201d as of this writing has over 50 million views and prominently features the silver bullet that \u201cpeople don\u2019t buy what you do they buy why you do it.\u201d\n\nBut what is it that makes a silver bullet what it is? What each of these examples as well as every other one all have in common is that they are each a cause-and-effect sentence: when we take this action, we get this outcome.\n\nWhen we buy runs, we win the game.\n\nWhen we deceive our opponent, we win the war.\n\nWhen we get the team right, we get the ideas right.\n\nWhen we focus on why, people buy.\n\nThis simple device has the impact it has \u2014 it is remembered, highlighted, and emphasized \u2014 because it does a very important thing.\n\nIt empowers the audience without any other context.\n\nIt empowers them to suddenly believe in a different possibility.\n\nWhen someone is suddenly empowered in a way that they weren\u2019t a moment ago, they have an ah-ha moment.\n\nAnd when someone suddenly has a particularly powerful ah-ha moment, they get chills.\n\nThe silver bullet and the elevator pitch\n\nThis technique has significant bearing on an elevator pitch, in that it explains to one\u2019s audience why they\u2019re getting the results that they are. They may have succeeded in attracting customers, clients, or followers, but this silver bullet delivers the secret sauce. It explains why that success is there in the first place, and why further success can be scaled.\n\nHow can one craft the 20 seconds that will potentially give their listener chills? What many people who learn of this silver bullet concept believe at first is that the more prominent they make their silver bullet the more powerful it will be. In this way, they treat it like a tag line.\n\nBut tag lines and silver bullets are two different devices. Tag lines are essentially a promise that brands make so as to attract others as part of a first impression \u2014 as conveyed on a product\u2019s package, for example.\n\nA silver bullet, however, is the recipe that makes that promise possible. It\u2019s the secret sauce that makes the solution as valuable as it is, and as established earlier in this article people are most likely to embrace a solution when it\u2019s provided within the context of a problem they care about solving.\n\nGiven this importance of context, I recommend the first 20 seconds of an elevator pitch be as follows:\n\nIdentify the problem the audience wants to solve, their pain point. Identify typical solutions, those that leave a hole in the marketplace. Provide the silver bullet, the reason why this new solution will work when other ones have not.\n\nThen, after creating this flow, the entrepreneur can present their product or service, describe its features and benefits, identify its proof of concept in the marketplace, and, if it\u2019s a formal pitch to investors, whatever the ask may be.\n\nAn elevator pitch for a famous brand\n\nLet\u2019s make TikTok into a hypothetical example so as to apply this structure to something tangible. Imagine that you are an executive looking to pitch the platform before its meteoric rise to having 800 million users by the end of 2019. You wish to convince would-be investors, stakeholders, or partners of its potential distinction in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cHow would this be different from Vine?\u201d a wary listener might ask. Vine\u2019s service, after all, had been discontinued only a couple of years before TikTok was merged with Musical.ly to become the juggernaut we know today. But with this structure, the speaker might open their elevator pitch as follows:\n\nWith so many streams of content available at any given moment, social media apps are struggling to keep users engaged for extended periods of time (the problem). Other platforms optimize their search algorithms so as to match user intent with content in as precise and aligned a way as possible (typical solutions). But the fewer decisions users must make, the more likely they are to engage (the silver bullet).\n\nThe pitch would then go on to explain the nature of the \u201cfor you\u201d algorithm utilized by TikTok, which curates the users experience thus eliminating decision-making as a barrier to further engagement.\n\nThough there would be more to learn to go into business together, this simply expressed idea would plant a seed as to how to actually increase average user engagement.\n\nAnd if this pitch were to happen after having reached a proof of concept, the speaker would be able to cite the extensive period of time any given user stays on the platform, which for many current users is nearly an hour.\n\nThe importance of a single ah-ha moment\n\nThe most effective elevator pitches inspire the belief that growth is possible. And many pitches are effective simply because the speaker is able to boast clear indicators of this possibility. They\u2019re able to address a relatable hole in the marketplace and a proof of concept that demonstrates an ability to fill that hole.\n\nBut a silver bullet empowers without context. It inspires that ah-ha moment, which in turn inspires chills.\n\nIn our fast-paced, cluttered, noisy world, this kind of visceral response is becoming rarer and rarer. We\u2019re numb to so much of what we consume. Therefore, when you inspire this kind of visceral experience in so little time, you will create an undeniable connection between your audience and your content. You will inspire not only deals but views of talks, highlighted passages in ebooks, and other demonstrations of empowerment.\n\nWith this empowerment, the user won\u2019t just have a connection to your content, they will have a connection to you as the person who created it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when you go from being an entrepreneur to being the face of a movement.\n\nRelated: Hold That Door! 7 Rules for an Elevator Pitch.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/352514", "author": ["Neil Gordon"]}, {"title": "How to Launch Your Product Without Sinking Your Savings", "text": "February 13, 2020 4 min read\n\nIn this ongoing series, we are sharing advice, tips and insights from real entrepreneurs who are out there doing business battle on a daily basis.

No one knows your product or service as well as you do. Some key points to remember, let your audience know who you are (introduce the company), what does the product or service do, why should they invest, what industry will you affect and what are some statistical facts about the industry?\n\nHow did it feel the first day you opened for business?\n\nOur first day of business was nerve-racking and exciting at the same time. Although we\u2019re an 85% online business, waiting to receive that initial order was intense, but during our prelaunch, we had one customer purchase over 2000 units of The Restroom Kit. That let us know we had something special. The consulting wing of the business took a little longer to pick up, but it did.\n\nWhat was your toughest challenge and how did you overcome it?\n\nThe toughest challenge was finding a reasonable manufacturer. We negotiated with companies that made promises they couldn\u2019t deliver. We\u2019d agree on deliverables templates, prototypes or samples which they overcharge and under-delivered. We overcame those challenges by doing our due diligence deeper research; asking the right questions; hiring companies that we could visit frequently.\n\nIs there a particular quote or saying that you use as personal motivation? What is it and explain how it inspires you\n\nSonia: \"Keep going through your nos because they will get you to your yesses quicker.\" This inspires me because every customer I received a NO from is going to bring me closer to the Yes customers.\n\nBill: \"Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.

It\u2019s a high-pressure, fast-paced environment in which startup founders need to race against the clock while maintaining their composure to make a clear, deliberate pitch that covers at least three essential components:\n\nDefining the company Making the request Specifying what the investment money will be used for\n\nThe investors watch the pitch via a video livestream while the elevator ascends to the boardroom floor. Once the 60 seconds are up, the judges vote on whether to open the doors or send the founder back down and pass on investing.\n\nThe fifth season of Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch offers a dynamic change in the show's format. Before, our four judges needed unanimous agreement to make an offer to the pitching entrepreneurs \u2060\u2014 including three out of four \"yes\" votes just to open the elevator doors. Now, it only takes one investor to open the doors and one judge to make an offer. The panel of four can then choose whether they want to collaborate or compete against one another.\n\nEpisode 9 featured Beth Vasquez, the founder of Recess & Results, who was kind enough to detail her experience on the show below.\n\nEntrepreneur: What is your company's elevator pitch?\n\nVasquez: Recess & Results is entertaining exercise for kids, and a praiseworthy paycheck for people with passions for faith, family and fitness.\n\nWe are the only faith-based kids fitness program and turn-key business opportunity on the market. Our virtual platform houses training modules, lesson plans and program guides, and essential business resources that transform our partners into confident, purpose-driven entrepreneurs and kid and family fitness experts.\n\nIndividuals with passions for faith, family and fitness partner with us for a low, one-time investment of just $249 and small recurring monthly partnership fee of $49. They complete the self-paced training online via our platform, and can be ready to launch their own Recess business in their community in as little as one week.\n\nThe demand for children\u2019s activities have skyrocketed, making the industry one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy.\n\n46 percent of parents spend more than $1,000 per year on their child\u2019s activities,\n\nof parents spend more than $1,000 per year on their child\u2019s activities, 81 percent of parents believe that the amount of money they spend on their child\u2019s extracurricular activities is in direct correlation with their development, thus parents spend on children\u2019s activities regardless of financial difficulty making it a recession proof business.\n\nKids are unhealthier and unhappier than ever before. As obesity, anxiety, depression, rise, parents are desperately seeking ways to build healthy habits, confidence and character in kids in a way that is fun for them.\n\nRecess & Results provides a unique, Christ-centered option for increasing your income on your own terms. Whether working part-time, full-time, or sometimes, not only can you earn a wage that matches your worth, you will grow personally and professionally while serving God alongside a family of believers on a mission to \u201csave the world, one recess at a time\u201d.\n\nWhy did you choose to start this business?\n\nWorking in both the fitness industry, and on the corporate side of the mid-level marketing (MLM) industry, I noticed an obvious demand for kids fitness programs and side-hustle opportunities and the lack of faith-based options in both areas. As a Christian mom, I intentionally look for opportunities to grow my faith and keep my family healthy and happy. As a career woman I felt the stigma of discussing faith at work and felt the pressure to keep career as the No. 1 priority. My priorities of faith, family and fitness (in that order) didn\u2019t fit corporate America and I knew I couldn\u2019t be alone. RR was the answer for me and from my work in the MLM industry, I knew I could turn it into an opportunity for others as well. The programs Recess & Results offer sell themselves, making it easy for our partners to be successful.\n\nHow was your experience in the elevator during Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch?\n\nThe overall experience was life-changing and a turning point for me in business. Lasting relationships were built that day, and my faith in God's plan for my life through this business was strengthened. A mindset shift occurred as a result of this experience and the conversations I was blessed to have that allowed me to 4x my business growth in the month that followed.\n\nWere you more or less nervous than you expected?\n\n\"Nervous\" I can handle, and I believe a little nervousness is a good thing! However, I was definitely more emotional than expected!\n\nAny surprises?\n\nThe timer counting down in my face surprised me. I practiced my pitch for time, but never staring at a countdown. But more than that, the genuineness of everyone on the crew and from the executive at Entrepreneur surprised me in the most amazing way. The authentic desire to help us be successful beyond just the filming of the show (and even after I didn\u2019t get off the elevator) was unexpected but immensely appreciated.\n\nIf you could do it over again, what would you change?\n\nI have zero regrets! I wouldn\u2019t change this experience because I needed everything to happen as it did to teach me the valuable lessons I learned. That said, if I were to come back to the show for a second time, I would restructure my pitch to paint a better picture of the industry landscape and trajectory, and talk more about the proprietary resources we offer our owners to ensure their success with their new Recess & Results business. I would also practice my pitch with distractions all around me to enhance focus.\n\nWhat did you learn from this experience that you will bring to your next pitch meeting?\n\nWhere do I start? I learned mental resilience, business strategy, gained focus and clarity in what a good pitch is made up of, and was also reminded that there is a purpose for every step in the journey. I did not walk away with a deal from the investors, but the personal, professional, and spiritual development was worth far more. God showed up so many times through this process and His presence was undeniable. I can walk into the next pitch meeting knowing that when I come prepared and do my best for God, He is there with me doing the rest, and I trust the outcome is in His hands.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/344054", "author": ["Entrepreneur Staff"]}, {"title": "7 Ways to Avoid the No.1 Virtual Sales Meeting Mistake", "text": "July 29, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t log on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t my video working?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one else is in the meeting room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see your screen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe video conference program won\u2019t download on my device.\u201d\n\nIn a new study on virtual selling, 89 percent of buyers report somewhat frequently experiencing some sort of technical problem in virtual sales meetings. And 30 percent report they experience these problems frequently.\n\nThat means the virtual sales meetings they attend commonly have tech issues. And if your meeting is one with problems, your chances of success aren\u2019t good. Ninety-one percent of buyers say that effective use of technology when leading a virtual sales meeting highly or moderately influences their ultimate purchase decision.\n\nBottom line: avoid virtual selling technology problems.\n\nHere are seven ways you can avoid common virtual sales meeting technology mistakes\n\n1. Prepare meeting attendees in advance with clear instructions\n\nSet the technology expectations in advance and communicate them with all meeting attendees.\n\nWill you be on video? If you\u2019re selling, the answer should be yes. Let all participants know your webcam will be on for the call and provide instructions for how to they can turn theirs on. A simple screenshot here can go a long way.\n\nDo they need to download the meeting platform program? If so, provide a link and let them know how to get the program and test ahead of time.\n\nMake the instructions for how to enter the meeting clear. Provide a clickable meeting link and one-touch mobile dial-in to make it easy for participants to quickly get in the meeting. (If you\u2019re ever joined a conference call from your mobile phone, you know how helpful a one-touch dial-in is.)\n\n2. Run a tech check\n\nIf you have an important meeting such as a proposal presentation or larger group meeting, ask to start early with at least one member of the buyer team to run a 10-minute tech check beforehand. You won\u2019t always get a yes, but this will help to ensure the buyers are able to login properly, any audio or video works without a glitch and your visuals come through well via screensharing.\n\nNothing is more frustrating than wasting the first 15 minutes of a meeting because someone can\u2019t login or you can\u2019t figure out how to share the correct screen of your PowerPoint presentation.\n\n3. Increase your internet speed and bandwidth\n\nRaise your virtual hand if you\u2019ve been on a video conference recently and either the other person froze, or you saw an \u2018unstable internet connection\u2019 warning.\n\nRelated: Free Webinar: How to Future-Proof Your Business\n\nMost everyone can upgrade their internet speed through their internet service provider. Get a new router. Try a direct cable to your router instead of WIFI. Close background applications, especially ones that auto-refresh. Each of these will help to enhance the experience.\n\nA seller recently told us about her bandwidth issues at her house. She just hadn\u2019t thought about upgrading because she bought \u2018fast internet,\u2019 but didn\u2019t know there were all sorts of levels of fast. She called her internet provider, upgraded her service, and invested in a new router. All good now on her end.\n\n4. Choose a reliable meeting platform\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird. I was logged in, but no one was there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see Sarah is on the call, but we can\u2019t hear you\u2026.Sarah are you there?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try logging out and logging back in.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy meeting\u2019s already in progress?!? No, it\u2019s not, I haven\u2019t started it yet!\u201d\n\nYour platform, it\u2019s reliability, ease of use and security have a significant impact on a buyer\u2019s experience with you. There are many platforms to choose from, each with their own features, security and requirements. Research and choose a proven platform for your meetings. If you have ongoing issues, it\u2019s time to investigate a new platform.\n\n5. Invest in quality audio and video\n\nMost (but not all) built-in computer cameras and microphones are low to average quality. It\u2019s well worth it to invest in high-quality external devices that produce a crisp picture and clear sound.\n\nRelated: How the Crisis is Changing Consumer Behavior and Sales\n\nUse an HD webcam. Many of them also come with high-quality built-in microphones. Consider using a headset, and a podcasting-quality mic that minimizes background noise.\n\n6. Master your platform\n\nSo many buttons! Each platform has different functionality, shortcuts and tricks. Get to know your platform. Attend to best practices. At a minimum, you should be comfortable with platform annotation tools, screensharing, video, mute and audio, chat, virtual backgrounds, sharing and playing video, and meeting recording.\n\nRegardless of your platform, there are many resources available to learn the ins and outs. Take a few hours to brush up your knowledge and try a few tools. You\u2019ll be impressed with what you learn and how you can use the technology to your advantage.\n\n7. Have a 60-second backup plan\n\nEven the best-laid plans often go awry. What will you do if your audio isn\u2019t working? If a key attendee can\u2019t get in the meeting? If participants can\u2019t view your screen? If there\u2019s a technical snafu in the middle of the meeting?\n\nPlan for the various errors and glitches that can occur. Have a standard dial-in number if computer audio isn\u2019t working. Use a reliable conference call service. (And have that number handy all the time so you don\u2019t have to search for it when you need it!) Be prepared to share documents via email if you aren\u2019t able to screenshare.\n\nAvoiding technology problems isn\u2019t going to win you the sale, but it might lose it for you. You want your comfort and tech-savviness to demonstrate your professionalism and what it\u2019s like to work with you.\n\nImpress, don\u2019t frustrate, buyers by following these seven simple tips.", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/352441", "author": ["Mike Schultz"]}, {"title": "10 Must-Have Productivity and Life Hacks for WFH", "text": "July 23, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nAt the end of every working day, I turn the sign on my home office door from \u201copen\u201d to \u201cclosed,\" and then walk down the hall and go fix myself dinner.\n\nI have worked from home for nearly 15 years now. And now, due to the health crisis, I'm less alone in that experience than ever before. While working from home can sound idyllic \u2014 cue the visions of working in pajamas all day long \u2014 it has its own unique challenges that are sometimes hard to anticipate.\n\nThere are two big challenges for most people who .\n\nOne is staying productive.\n\nThe other is not letting your work take over your entire life.\n\nIn the 15 years that I\u2019ve worked from home, I\u2019ve developed an arsenal of 10 hacks that helps me conquer both of these challenges\u2026 most of the time. I\u2019ve taught these hacks to many other people in my consulting practice, and they just work!\n\nNo system is perfect, but I find that these strategies help be extremely productive working from home while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.\n\nGuard your time\n\nThere is a strange thing that happens when people find out that you don\u2019t go into the office every day. They start to invite you to stuff during the day when you are supposed to be working.\n\nI\u2019ve met a few people that can truly live a flexible and not have set work hours, but most people who work from home need to make sure they aren\u2019t saying yes to things that eat into their work time.\n\nLive by your calendar\n\nThis ties into the last tip, but is slightly different. Schedule everything on your calendar. I use Google calendar, but you can use Apple Calendar, Outlook calendar, etc. Heck, I know a few people who still use pen and paper calendars.\n\nThe key is to block out time for whatever you have on your schedule. If you are working from 8 to 5 with an hour for lunch, put that in. If you are working out 3 times a week, put that in.\n\nLetting your calendar determine what you are doing at any particular time takes a lot of decision making off your shoulders and makes most people far more productive.\n\nEven though I'm self-employed and own my own business, I still have a boss: my calendar.\n\nGet out of your house\n\nWhen you work from home getting out of your house can often seem like just too much effort. The errands you would usually run on the way home from the office often get put off.\n\nBut getting out of your house is important for most people to keep their levels up.\n\nTake a walk. Sit on your porch with your laptop and get some sun. Do something that you enjoy outside of the four walls of your home.\n\nRelated: How to Effectively Work from Home During a Pandemic\n\nDelineate home time and work time\n\nIn the intro to this article, I talked about the sign I have on the door of my home office. It says \u201copen\u201d on one side and \u201cclosed\u201d on the other. When I\u2019m working I set it to open and when I\u2019m not I set it to closed. You can get an open/closed sign at the local office store. As silly as this sounds... it really works if you commit to yourself that you will not work once the sign says closed.\n\nWhen you work from home it\u2019s easy to want to look productive and to let your work time bleed into your home life. But the next thing you know you're burning the midnight oil, wondering where the day went.\n\nWorking from home, I've found I'm much more productive and happy when I have clear boundaries between work life and home life.\n\nFocus on the task at hand\n\nThis one took me a long time to master. When you work at home your environment can be much more distracting than when you work at an office. If you want to enjoy your work and not be stressed out all the time, it\u2019s important to focus on the task you are doing and then move onto something else.\n\nFocus is a skill that can be learned and it is one that is well worth learning.\n\nGet website blocking software\n\nMost people who work from home work on their computers. It\u2019s very tempting to want to quickly check Facebook, watch a YouTube video, or read a quick news story. Before you know it that quick check turns into 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or more. Of course, this doesn't help you get work done, impress your boss, or make you money.\n\nIf you are routinely drawn to browsing the web instead of working, then you should seriously consider getting one of the many website blocking programs that are on the market. There are many extensions for Chrome that work well. I personally like StayFocused for its flexibility.\n\nGet dressed for real\n\nWhile working in your PJs all day is the fantasy that many people dream about, the reality is that for most people I know, getting dressed as if you are going to work can help a great deal with being in the right frame of mind to work.\n\nI find that if I look presentable I work harder and smarter than if I\u2019m sitting around in pajamas.\n\nRelated: 10 Tips From CEOs on Working From Home Effectively and Happily\n\nTrack your time\n\nIt\u2019s VERY easy to waste time when you are working from home. One thing that really helps is using a time tracking app. I\u2019ve found that the simple act of recording the amount of time you spend on every task can help add an element of accountability to where you're spending your time and help you be far more productive.\n\nI like the Toggle chrome extension. It\u2019s easy to use and gets the job done.\n\nGet up and move\n\nSlouching over a monitor all day is terrible for your back and your body. Most people do better if they take a few minutes every few hours to take a short walk or squeeze in a quick chore around the house.\n\nIf you're using a productivity system like the Pomodoro Technique then this is automatically built into your schedule. I also have my Apple Watch remind me to stand up and take a break ten minutes before every hour.\n\nTake time for joy\n\nMake sure when you are scheduling your calendar that you include things in it that bring you joy. That might be cooking a nice dinner, doing a craft project, or visiting with the ones you love.\n\nAll work and no play is no good for anyone. Scheduling in joy will give you something to look forward to and help recharge your batteries so you can be productive when you get back to work.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the calendar is my boss; luckily my boss demands that I do things that bring me joy.\n\nWhether you've been working from home for years or, like many people, are still adjusting to working from home any of these tips can help you be more productive, create work-life boundaries when working from home, and take time to enjoy life. Try one, two, or all ten and see which ones work for you.\n\nRelated: 3 Ways Strong Leaders Can Support Work-From-Home Employees", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/353573", "author": ["Brian T.

Operating remotely, companies can save money, access a bigger talent pool and look more attractive in the eyes of job seekers. But that also comes with drawbacks, including a less cohesive brand culture and more challenging communication.\n\nTo anxious entrepreneurs and traditional team leaders, operating fully remotely is a scary thought. But there are plenty of examples of companies that have thrived using a purely remote model. What is it that led them to success? And can you replicate their approach for your own business?\n\nRelated: 4 Tips for Managing Communication Among Remote, Multilingual Teams\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the most prominent examples of successful businesses that have operated fully remotely (or close to it):\n\nAutomattic\n\nOne of the most commonly cited names in the world of fully remote businesses is Automattic, better known as the parent company of Wordpress \u2014 the most popular blog and website creation tool in the world. Wordpress, which is now used by 30 percent of all websites, was created with a completely virtual workspace. So what made it so successful? Part of the answer lies with its communication philosophy. Most companies that go fully remote simply turn meetings into video conferences and rely more heavily on email and instant chat, but Automattic takes things a step further. It has completely re-optimized its communication systems with many different channels, including a social media-like shared blog for public communication. Additionally, Automattic keeps employees connected and talking to each other with shared activities, like coloring, chair yoga, book clubs, virtual dog parks and even an open mic night.\n\nInVision\n\nInVision is a product design and prototyping app used by more than three million designers, but what\u2019s really impressive is that the company operates with a distributed team across 25 countries. Part of what\u2019s made the company successful is its robust investment in its employees. InVision offers employees a comprehensive medical insurance package, along with gym memberships that both keep employees healthy and give them a platform to socialize. Additionally, employees can enjoy a generous salary, substantial equipment allowances and a roomy budget for travel and conferences.\n\nBuffer\n\nBuffer is a company that creates tools that make social media much easier to manage. It\u2019s also been fully remote from the very beginning. So what\u2019s the secret to its success? If there\u2019s one factor to consider more than the others, it\u2019s the business\u2019s flexibility. Employees have the option to work wherever they want, whether it\u2019s from a local caf\u00e9 or from their own home. Additionally, employees can exercise autonomy over their own projects and their own hours, allowing them to work in the ways that allow them to reap their full potential.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Aligning Your Remote Team's Goals\n\nZapier\n\nZapier makes automation software, enabling companies to automate their workflows and combine the functionality of several apps simultaneously. It\u2019s also been operating fully remotely since its launch nearly 10 years ago. One of its best qualities is its effective use of tools. Most modern remote teams already understand the need for certain tools to enable communication and collaboration across vast distances, and the power that automation can have in reducing the burden of small, menial tasks. Your choice in tools, and how you use them, plays a major role in determining your success. Zapier figured that out early and either purchased or created the best possible combination of tools for its team to use.\n\nMozilla\n\nBest known as the creator of the Firefox browser, Mozilla is a development company with an impressive talent pool and an ongoing commitment to creating great products. It\u2019s kind of cheating to put it on this list, since its workforce isn\u2019t fully remote, but more than half its workforce has been remote for much of its history. As with many of the companies on this list, there are many factors responsible for its success, but one of the most notable is its emphasis on the brand\u2019s core values, among them being transparency. Mozilla coordinates and unifies its teams by setting strict company policies and encouraging all its employees to live and thrive in the same brand culture.\n\nLearning from the best\n\nObviously, there are other factors for success we didn\u2019t discuss here. Many of these businesses are tech companies, making them better poised to operate remotely than, say, a fitness center. They also have strong business models that could have made them a success regardless of whether or not they had a .\n\nBut looking beyond these additional factors, there are many lessons an aspiring entrepreneur can learn. When you give your employees more flexibility, the tools they need to communicate effectively and unify them under the same banner, you enable them to do their best work, even when they\u2019re working outside of the conventional office.

But what if they were different?\n\nOur perception of U.S. politics wouldn\u2019t be the same without the Electoral College. Thanks to most states\u2019 winner-take-all rules (Nebraska and Maine are the only two states that can split their votes), the Electoral College turns states into red and blue Legos. We comfortably call California a \u201cblue state\u201d even though it\u2019s home to millions of Republican voters, and we refer to Alabama as a solidly \u201cred state\u201d despite the fact that a third of its voters preferred Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nPlenty of Democrats are interested in changing that. Elizabeth Warren has called for the abolishment of the Electoral College, and a handful of states have signed on to a plan that would essentially bypass the Electoral College \u2014 members of the National Popular Vote initiative have pledged to throw their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner no matter who their state voted for, but the agreement won\u2019t kick in until the states involved have enough electoral votes to guarantee that whoever they vote for will win. But the chances of either idea getting enacted are still pretty remote.\n\nOne way to understand just how skewed the Electoral College can be is by rearranging the states inside of it. We know what would happen if the Electoral College were gone, but what would happen if it were simply different?\n\nOur current state borders are fairly arbitrary. Throughout American history, people have been proposing new states, but most don\u2019t appear on the map today, either because they once existed but were later redrawn, or because they simply never caught on. But what if some of these would-be states were around today? Would moving those state borders, without changing any votes, change our political reality?\n\nThe short answer is probably not, at least in 2016: Of the 13 maps we tested, none of them flipped the outcome of the last presidential election. These new maps did shift the Electoral College vote margin by as much as 38 votes, but since President Trump won by more than 70 votes, it wasn\u2019t enough to swing the election to Clinton.\n\nPlay around with the maps yourself to see what I mean:\n\n13 (imaginary) Electoral Colleges See what would change if these fake states existed (and all Electoral College votes were apportioned based on 2016 population) CHOOSE A FAKE STATE Absaroka Chicago Deseret New York City Franklin Jefferson Lincoln Old Massachusetts Original Virginia Pico Republic of Texas Superior Westsylvania SWITCH VIEW TO Current state boundaries 2016 MARGIN D R +10 +20 +30 +40 The state of Superior, encompassing the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and a few counties in Wisconsin, was proposed in 1897 . Superior would have had a population of 383,573 and three electoral votes in 2016. Trump would have won Superior by a 21-point margin, leaving Michigan\u2019s lower peninsula to be narrowly won by Clinton. How these maps would have voted in 2016 Electoral vote margin for each map The \u201cactual\u201d line represents what the 2016 Electoral College margin would have been if there had been no faithless electors (R+74). The \u201cCurrent state borders\u201d map above has a slightly different distribution of electoral votes because it apportions the Electoral College based on 2016 population and ignores the fact that Maine split its votes.\n\n(Please don\u2019t write in to tell me about how, if any of these states had actually come to be, our politics would be different, the butterfly effect, blah blah etc. This is a thought exercise! I ignored some other realities as well: Faithless electors and split electoral votes don\u2019t exist here, for example; all electoral tallies assume electors voted for the person who won their state. We redistributed all Electoral College votes based on 2016 population, which means some real states have more or fewer votes than they did in reality that year, when the Electoral College was based on 2010 population. Adding and removing senators also changes the total number of electors, so not all maps will add up to 538, the current total number of electors. In one map \u2014 The Republic of Texas \u2014 Texas\u2019 representatives were simply removed, dropping the total number of electors to 498. And since Americans have proposed and rejected more maps than one person can draw, I used Wikipedia and my own interest level to decide which fake states to include. If you want more details about the technical process of producing these maps, a) God bless, and b) check the methodology section below.)\n\nWhile none of those fake maps would have produced a different outcome in 2016, there is a relatively easy way to rewrite the past \u2014 if we free ourselves from the constraints of history and instead do a little strategic shuffling. By reallocating two protuberant state parts (the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the Florida Panhandle) to their neighbors (Wisconsin and Alabama, respectively), we can flip the outcome of 2016 with a single click.\n\nOne easy way to flip the election All it takes is New Wisconsin and New Alabama SWITCH VIEW TO Current state boundaries 2016 MARGIN D R +10 +20 +30 +40 How these maps would have voted in 2016 Electoral vote margin for each map The \u201cactual\u201d line represents what the 2016 Electoral College margin would have been if there had been no faithless electors (R+74).

For better or worse, we will return to the same old red-and-blue map on the next election night, and we\u2019ll simply be watching to see if any states change color.

This year, like nearly every other in the past decade, the New England Patriots\u2019 refusal to regress to the mean is a central storyline.\n\nRemember back when the Patriots were 0-1 and faced a must-win in Week 2? Well, they won. Then in Week 4 they dropped to 2-2, and the end of an era was supposedly nigh. Except no. Pats will be Pats, and now they\u2019ve won their last six games en route to the best record in the AFC. That streak has included comfortable wins against the Cincinnati Bengals (who at one point projected to have the best record), the surprisingly strong Buffalo Bills, and Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck. (The Patriots are also tied with the Green Bay Packers for a league-leading point differential). And according to my colleague Neil Paine, the Patriots are really a second-half team. I shudder to think.\n\nBut there\u2019s another storyline that\u2019s dominated the exposition period: The best record in the NFL belongs to the 9-1 Arizona Cardinals. While they\u2019ve beaten some decent teams like Dallas, Philadelphia and San Francisco, they don\u2019t have what the yakkers call a \u201csignature\u201d win. They have only the seventh-best SRS in football, second to the Packers in the NFC, and only a half-point ahead of the defending champion Seattle Seahawks (who have four losses).\n\nAside from being the class of their respective conferences so far this year, the two franchises have little in common. The Cardinals have now secured their second winning season in a row \u2014 and can count that as an accomplishment in light of their 90-year history of losing. Although the Patriots\u2019 dominance of the regular season continues apace, they will likely be disappointed if they don\u2019t win their first Super Bowl in 10 years.\n\nTo illustrate just how divergent these two franchises have been, I created a chart to show the entire history of the NFL (or at least what we have stats for). This is the cumulative regular-season point differential since 1920, for all teams (with the Patriots and the Cardinals highlighted):\n\nThe current Patriots dynasty is lengthy and steep, and belongs in the same group as the San Francisco 49ers of the 1980s, the Cleveland Browns of the \u201950s and \u201960s, or the Chicago Bears of the \u201930s and \u201940s (especially when you factor in league parity).\n\nThat chart is fun, but it would be a lot more useful if we could make out all 81 NFL franchises individually. Well \u2026\n\nChart of the week\n\nThanks to the great work of designated Skeptical Football charts guru Reuben Fischer-Baum, you can do just that. Roll over a line to see the team\u2019s entire history, and move along the line to see exactly how many points it has scored compared to its opponents at a given point. You can also click on a team to keep its line highlighted, and then roll over another team for comparison. Irrelevant dates (where no regular-season games were played) are excluded from the timeline.\n\nHere are a couple of things I found from the interactive that I thought were interesting:\n\nEven more Aaron Rodgers\n\nFirst, Aaron Rodgers \u2014 apparently unmoved by my ongoing criticism of his failure to throw more interceptions \u2014 is absolutely tearing it up this year (at least when his team is ahead, which is most of the time lately). Recently, he accomplished something pretty cool that I didn\u2019t know about:\n\nOn Sept. 25, 2011, Rodgers threw three touchdown passes as the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears 27-17. With that result, the Packers had scored 2,991 more points than their opponents all-time, ahead of the Bears\u2019 2,989 \u2014 and the Packers haven\u2019t looked back. As of last Sunday, Green Bay held the NFL\u2019s best historical margin of victory by 358 points.\n\nComment of the week\n\nLast week Neil Paine and I wrote an article titled \u201cRandy Moss May Well Have Been The Greatest Receiver Of All Time\u201d \u2014 which focused on the insane \u201cWith Or Without You\u201d stats that Moss put up in his career. In the discussion, we raised the possibility that if receivers can have as much of an impact as Randy Moss appeared to have, that may cast doubt on some previous knowledge \u2014 like how good of a quarterback Joe Montana was considering he had Jerry Rice running routes for so long.\n\nA few different people in the comments and elsewhere raised the point that Joe Montana had already won two Super Bowls before Jerry Rice arrived in San Francisco:\n\nUpon further consideration, I\u2019m inclined to agree that it\u2019s fairly unlikely that Rice was the driving force behind the 49ers\u2019 success. But I\u2019m not so sure Montana was either.\n\nWinning in the NFL can happen for a lot of different reasons \u2014 a star quarterback (think Peyton Manning), a successful new offensive or defensive strategy (think West Coast offense, zone blitz, or, more recently, the Wildcat), or a standout player who creates mismatches that other teams struggle with (think Randy Moss). But the effects of various win-generating phenomena can come in a lot of shapes and sizes.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s compare the 49ers to the St. Louis Rams. Pay particular attention to the \u201cGreatest Show on Turf\u201d era from 1999 into the early 2000s:\n\nThe \u201cGreatest Show on Turf\u201d Rams had a few different things going for them, but their success was sudden, rocky, and lasted only a few years. They \u201cbroke the game\u201d for a while in the sense that they were something the rest of the NFL didn\u2019t know how to deal with. But despite having a lasting effect on how football is played, their dominance was fragile.\n\nOn the other hand, from the early \u201980s to the late \u201990s, the 49ers outscored their opponents by around 2,500 points \u2014 by far the most dominant stretch in the Super Bowl era. And they did it with a practically straight line, meaning they were better than their opposition by a nearly constant amount.\n\nIf the 49ers owed a significant part of their success to any one player (or phenomenon of any kind), we\u2019d likely see more variety in the team\u2019s arc as that player\u2019s performance fluctuated, or as he was injured, or left. But the consistency of the 49ers\u2019 ascension suggests they were more of an organization-driven phenomenon. At the very least, it implies that they were the sum of many different quality parts.\n\nPlaying around with the interactive, I\u2019m fascinated by how different phenomena manifest. For example: How do the impacts of offensive and defensive innovation compare? What are the effects of a quarterback versus those of a coach? There are a lot of possibilities, so let us know what you uncover in the comments or on Twitter.\n\nWeek 11 kicking awards\n\nI keep thinking (and my editor keeps hoping) this will be the week I won\u2019t bother talking about kickers, but then Las Vegas Locomotives alumnus Graham Gano has to go and attempt a 63-yard field goal with one second left in a thriller between the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons. Unfortunately for the Panthers, it was blocked.\n\nMy kicking model suggests that a kicker in 2014 should typically be able to make a 63-yard field goal around 40 percent of the time \u2014 but this may be skewed by the fact that such long kicks are so rarely attempted. Still, Gano\u2019s 63-yarder wasn\u2019t what earned him the \u201ckicker loss\u201d and Week 11\u2019s Least Valuable Kicker award. What did him in was his previous miss, a 46-yarder, which a 2014 NFL kicker should typically make about 77 percent of the time.\n\nMy algorithm picked the Falcons\u2019 Matt Bryant as the MVK over the St. Louis Rams\u2019 Greg Zeurlein (who had an excellent week, going 5/5 with two 50+ yarders in the Rams\u2019 huge upset of the Broncos), on account of Bryant making four field goals in a game his team only won by two (though none was over 44 yards).\n\nBut the biggest news of the week is that with Nick Novak missing a kick for the San Diego Chargers, we\u2019re down to just two perfect kickers, and they\u2019re both veterans: the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 Adam Vinatieri and the New York Giants\u2019 Josh Brown.\n\nGunslinger of the week\n\nThere were 26 interceptions thrown in Week 11, and seven of them were thrown by the Manning brothers. Eli Manning had five in the Giants\u2019 narrow loss against the 49ers \u2014 four of which were thrown with his team trailing \u2014 enough to win him our Gunslinger of the Week award.\n\nThrowing a practically embarrassing number of interceptions now and then is something great quarterbacks do. QBs, don\u2019t be ashamed of looking bad when trying to win! A loss is a loss, whether you throw zero interceptions or six. My maxim is: If a quarterback loses a game without throwing a few interceptions, he probably didn\u2019t try hard enough.\n\nIn general, Eli Manning is a bit of an unknown. He puts up fairly big totals for a mediocre team, but often gets criticized for his high interception rate. Yet his win curve looks mostly like his big brother\u2019s, only flatter, and it\u2019s plausible that his shame-free style was partially responsible for the Giants\u2019 shocking wins in two Super Bowls. Eli\u2019s gambling wouldn\u2019t necessarily make the Giants favorites against stronger competition, but it might have given them a better chance against a team like the 2007 Patriots than a better team with a quarterback who took fewer risks.\n\nJust for fun, I looked at the Pro Football Reference list of quarterbacks with the most four-plus-interception games. The top four are George Blanda, Joe Namath, Ken Stabler and Terry Bradshaw (all of whom won championships, and three of whom are in the Hall of Fame). Of the top 50 such QBs, 15 have won championships (and account for 20 Super Bowls), including both brothers Manning.\n\nRookie QB watch\n\nThe biggest news in rookie QB-land was in Tennessee, where sixth-round-pick Zach Mettenberger had a fairly strong game against the Pittsburgh Steelers (263 yards and two touchdowns). He\u2019s now guaranteed to reach the magical four-start line when rookie QBs are more likely to have successful careers. I\u2019m not quite ready to move him up in the rankings just yet, but every pass he completes is one more than Johnny Manziel has completed all year. As of now, I\u2019d order the rookies\u2019 estimated career prospects like so:\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 Blake Bortles had a bye week. The Oakland Raiders\u2019 Derek Carr, despite finally winning a game Thursday night (in dramatic fashion) has had a pretty weak couple of weeks, with just 172 and 174 yards in Weeks 11 and 12, despite a combined 69 pass attempts. The Minnesota Vikings\u2019 Teddy Bridgewater\u2019s two game winning streak came to an end in Chicago. Mettenberger. The Patriots\u2019 Jimmy Garropolo. Manziel once again got all dressed up with no ball to throw.\n\nNot really in the game yet but worth keeping an eye on: Logan Thomas is now second on the depth chart in Arizona. So far this year he has a 108.9 NFL Passer Rating, but he\u2019s gotten it the hard way: He has only one completion in eight attempts (10 if you count sacks), but it went for 81 yards and a touchdown.\n\nReader response\n\nIn Week 9\u2019s column, I introduced my experimental \u201cwin curves\u201d for quarterbacks, which depict how much each QB typically wins relative to various expectations, and I included a number of examples.\n\nI covered most popular quarterbacks, with a couple of notable exceptions. One request I got an awful lot:\n\n@skepticalsports As a Bears fan, I'd love to see the \"Win Curve\" for Jay Cutler that you wrote about in your latest @FiveThirtyEight column \u2014 John D. Kos (@johndkos) November 7, 2014\n\nI would have included Cutler initially, but I had a \u201cproblem\u201d with his curve: It was coming out as a perfectly straight line, virtually indistinguishable from the y=x guide (a highly unlikely outcome). I thought this might have been a data problem, but it turns out Cutler\u2019s results really were just too vanilla for the method I was using to pick up the variation. So I tried an alternate method that is more sensitive to small variation. The alternate method turned out to be less sensitive to large variation as well, so I was able to plot a couple more notable quarterbacks as well as Cutler:\n\nRussell Wilson \u2014 like his comrade Andrew Luck \u2014 has a very impressive curve so far in his career, albeit over a sample still probably too small for this analysis. (He also gets very good support from a strong team around him.)\n\nCutler\u2019s curve is still remarkably unremarkable, but at least it shows up. He appears to do slightly above average regardless of the circumstances. As a special treat for Bears fans who had to wait two weeks \u2014 and because I wanted to see what was going into this virtually straight line \u2014 I\u2019ve broken down Cutler\u2019s curve by quarter, and compared each to the same breakdown for Peyton Manning (our standard-bearer for such things):\n\nBeing very far ahead or behind in the first quarter is rare, so you should take the tails of that quadrant with a grain of salt. In the second and fourth quarters, Cutler seems to outperform average in a pretty uniform way, and in the third-quarter he has a bit of a reverse-Matthew Stafford thing going on.\n\nMost empirically significant game of this week\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 matchup against the defending champion Seahawks is a pretty big test for the team with the league\u2019s best record.\n\nBut on top of that, the Cardinals have a lot of important parts coming and going, which is always empirically significant: Their top QB (Carson Palmer) is out. Last week, Cardinals backup Drew Stanton held off the Detroit Lions\u2019 Stafford at the end of the game, but the Cardinals still struggled. Leading for most of the game, they rushed 26 times, but gained only 46 yards. And their top receiver, Larry Fitzgerald, is injured but may play anyway. As demonstrated in the article on Moss, the value of top-notch WRs can affect our broader understanding of the game.\n\nAnd then there are the Seahawks \u2014 who were young powerhouses last year, but are possibly already in decline \u2014 and Russell Wilson, who last year averaged 33.7 yards rushing per game. That\u2019s by far the most of any QB in a year his team won the Super Bowl \u2014 and he\u2019s averaging 57.1 per game this year. What \u201crunning\u201d quarterbacks mean for the game is a fascinating open question. A lot of newer, fancier QB-rating systems are giving QBs a lot of credit for their scrambling (often much more than if you treated those plays the same as completed pass attempts). But while those individual plays can be valuable, there haven\u2019t been a lot of dynamic offenses built around running QBs, and it\u2019s still unclear whether this is just a bonus skill or whether it will be a necessity in the future NFL.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps even more valuable to see Wilson in action with the Seahawks struggling a bit (it can also be harder to isolate an individual player\u2019s contributions when a team is firing on all cylinders). He\u2019ll be tested against a Cardinals defense that grades out as one of the best in the NFL this year \u2014 a perfect opportunity to see what both are made of.\n\nReminder: If you tweet questions to me @skepticalsports, there is a non-zero chance that I\u2019ll answer them here.\n\nCharts by Reuben Fischer-Baum.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/skeptical-football-patriots-vs-cardinals-and-an-interactive-history-of-the-nfl/", "author": ["Benjamin Morris"]}, {"title": "The Playoff Implications Of Every Game For Every NFL Team", "text": "\u201cPlayoff Implications\u201d is a phrase you usually don\u2019t hear until the final weeks of the NFL regular season, but almost every regular season game has playoff implications. In the early going, however, it can be difficult to figure out just what those implications are, and how much is riding on each game.\n\nMost other major sports leagues play a greater number of regular season games, and thus the playoff picture in those sports evolves in a more incremental fashion. The pace can seem glacial at times for MLB, and inevitable and foregone when it comes to the NBA. But with just 16 regular season games, the NFL\u2019s playoff landscape can change dramatically over the course of a single Sunday afternoon. And these tectonic shifts take place throughout the season, not just in those final weeks of December.\n\nWith a week or two left in the season, the \u201ceye test\u201d usually suffices for judging which games will shape the playoff picture. But in mid-October there are far too many possibilities for the unassisted human mind to make sense of. We can only speak in general terms. For example, we know the playoff chances for the New Orleans Saints will improve with a victory this Sunday over the Detroit Lions. But by how much? And how far would they drop with a loss? Expanding our focus, what other teams have a vested interest in the outcome of this game? One would expect Carolina\u2019s playoff chances to improve with a Saints loss, given that the Saints are their division rival. But once again, by how much?\n\nTo answer these questions, we\u2019ve created a weekly feature that measures the playoff implications of each game. To do this, you need to be able to simulate the remainder of the season multiple times and analyze the results. And in order to simulate the season, you need a way to rank all 32 teams, and use that ranking to create outcome probabilities for future games. We\u2019ve been doing just that with FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Elo rankings. But the Elo ratings, simple and beautiful, aren\u2019t the only word on NFL rankings. For this feature we\u2019re going to turn to the wisdom of the crowd instead, and use a ranking system one of the authors developed based on betting markets. In stock market terms, think of it as technical analysis in lieu of fundamental analysis.\n\nWe\u2019ll get into the methodology in a moment but first the results. Think of each interactive table below as a playoff implications \u201ccheat sheet\u201d for this week\u2019s upcoming games. (If you hover over a colored square, you\u2019ll see details for that game.)\n\n: The interactive tables above have been updated to include Thursday night\u2019s game, which now shows no playoff implications because its result is included in the playoff chances (the text of the article has not been updated).\n\nReading the table across tells you which teams are affected by any particular game. Reading the table down tells you which games matter most to any given team. For example, if you\u2019re a Texans fan, what games should you care about this week, how much should you care about them, and who do you want to win? The column headers are sortable, so clicking on the \u201cHOU\u201d column tells you to care about HOU @ PIT, ATL @ BAL, CIN @ IND, NYJ @ NE, CLE @ JAC, and KC @ SD \u2014 in that order. And you want the Texans, Falcons, Bengals, Jets, Jaguars and Chiefs to win.\n\nMy rankings start from the assumption that the NFL gambling market is efficient, and then attempts to determine how that efficient market ranks each of the 32 NFL teams. Unfortunately, Vegas doesn\u2019t actually share its rankings with the general public, but with a little reverse-engineering, we can arrive at a pretty good guess at what they are. We start with the point spread. For Thursday night\u2019s game, the New England Patriots are a 9.5-point favorite at home against the New York Jets. Since home field advantage is worth about 2.5 points, the market thinks the Patriots are 7 points better than the Jets when playing on a neutral field.\n\nArmed with this interpretation, we then take the point spreads from each game and for multiple weeks and run a simple linear regression to arrive at a consensus ranking. The process is akin to drawing a map of the United States but nobody tells you a city\u2019s location. Instead, they only tell you how far away each city is from another city (e.g. Los Angeles is 1,700 miles away from Chicago, Chicago is 165 miles from Indianapolis, and so on). To further complicate matters, our map \u201cmoves\u201d over time, making earlier \u201cdistance\u201d measurements less reliable. For example, the Steelers opened the season as a 6-point favorite at home against the Browns. If the market were to set that point spread today, Pittsburgh would most likely drop to just a 2.5-point favorite, as the Steelers have fallen short of preseason expectations, and the Browns have exceeded them. So, the ranking methodology gives more weight to recent point spread data in an attempt to get the most up-to-date market evaluation of each team.\n\nNow that we have a ranking system that assigns a probability to each future regular season game outcome, the next step is to simulate the season multiple times (50,000 times to be exact). After simulating win/loss records, we apply the NFL playoff seeding rules (plus tiebreakers) and summarize the results. There are already several sites that do these types of simulations for the purpose of producing team playoff odds (including FiveThirtyEight). For this feature, we\u2019re going to go a bit deeper than that.\n\nInstead of focusing on each team\u2019s overall playoff odds, let\u2019s instead focus on each game. We\u2019ll use the New Orleans-Detroit game as an example. Of the 50,000 simulation runs, there were precisely 30,180 (or about 60 percent) that resulted in a Lions victory, and 19,820 that resulted in a Saints victory. Let\u2019s now focus on those two samples in isolation. Of the 30,180 simulations in which the Saints lost, they made the playoffs 8,273 times, or 27 percent. Of the 19,820 simulations in which the Saints won, they made the playoffs 9,172 times, or 46 percent. Put simply, the Saints playoff odds could swing by a not-insignificant 19 percent as a result of their game against the Lions.

It\u2019s Much Easier To Get In Wealthier, Whiter Neighborhoods", "text": "Want A COVID-19 Test? It\u2019s Much Easier To Get In Wealthier, Whiter Neighborhoods But the disease is hitting Black and Hispanic communities hardest.\n\nWhen the coronavirus outbreak threatened to rock Philadelphia\u2019s predominantly Black neighborhoods, Dr. Ala Stanford knew that access to COVID-19 tests was going to be a problem.\n\nSo she rented a van, loaded it up and headed to the areas of the city where residents needed tests the most. Every test conducted was free.\n\nWhen Stanford began distributing tests in early April, she saw only a handful of testing centers in the city. Only a small share were in majority-Black neighborhoods, and the bar for actually getting a test was high.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been to locations that are predominantly African American where everyone had insurance and they couldn\u2019t get tested,\u201d said Stanford, referring to the often strict requirements providers had of those seeking tests as the outbreak began, such as doctor referrals, appointments and symptoms consistent with infection.\n\nStanford, a pediatric surgeon, quickly assembled a group of doctors and volunteers called the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium to help meet the challenge of testing the city\u2019s underserved residents. Together, the group has issued Philadelphia\u2019s residents more than 7,000 tests. But even with the intervention of medical professionals like Stanford stepping in to meet the rising demand, many communities of color across the country still face a dire situation in terms of getting a COVID-19 test.\n\nWith nearly 4 million coronavirus cases across the United States and hospitalizations surging in different parts of the country, there continues to be a growing demand for tests. Today, Americans routinely wait for hours to get an exam \u2014 if they can get one at all. Access is not available equally nationwide. Simply put, where Americans live and how much income they earn can still determine the ease with which they get a COVID-19 test.\n\nAccording to a new, extensive review of testing sites by ABC News, FiveThirtyEight and ABC-owned television stations, sites in communities of color in many major cities face higher demand than sites in whiter or wealthier areas in those same cities. The result of this disparity is clear: Black and Hispanic people are more likely to experience longer wait times and understaffed testing centers.\n\nThis nationwide review is one of the first to look at testing site locations coast to coast, in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., using data provided by the health care navigation company Castlight Health (the same data that Google Maps uses to surface COVID-19 testing sites). An assessment of city and state health department websites also revealed, over and over, fewer testing sites in areas primarily inhabited by racial minorities.\n\nImportantly, our analysis does not factor in the capacity of testing sites, which can vary from just 50 tests at one site to 2,000 at another, meaning that one site might be equipped to serve a larger number of people than another site. Instead, it looks at the potential demand for each site based on the number of people and sites nearby. The data we used is also less likely to reflect tests done in private physicians\u2019 offices than federally-funded community sites, local government-run mobile pop-up sites, urgent care clinics and hospitals. Additionally, this analysis doesn\u2019t take into account other factors that could determine testing accessibility, such as staffing and wait times, as well as other restrictions on testing like appointment or insurance requirements.\n\nWhen the outbreak began, testing posed the most immediate challenge to states, as a shortage of supplies, testing kits and processing backlogs created capacity problems. Since then, states have vastly increased their bandwidth to perform tests, but even now, experts from the Harvard Global Health Institute say daily testing needs to nearly double to help mitigate the pandemic. And states and cities are still struggling to determine how to allocate testing resources and where to place testing centers.\n\nThe Trump administration struggled early on in the pandemic to expand testing nationwide. Reliant on off-shore manufacturing that limited access to supplies like swabs and reagents, and armed with little data about who was getting sick and where, Trump\u2019s political appointees quickly embraced that the federal government\u2019s job would be mostly managing the logistics of testing such as supplies and distribution of state funds, as opposed to overseeing the coordination of state testing plans.\n\nBut critics say that strategy left many states scrambling to meet the rising demand that health experts say will only grow more urgent in the fall, when students return and flu season starts.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recently released a comprehensive strategy to address the disparate access to COVID-19 testing, including expanding testing at federally qualified health centers as well as supporting public-private partnerships that establish testing at retail pharmacy companies to accelerate testing within vulnerable populations. CVS and Walgreens \u2014 two of the retail pharmacies listed in the HHS plan \u2014 both said in statements to ABC News that more than half of their store locations issuing COVID-19 tests are now located in areas most in need, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s social vulnerability index.\n\nWHAT OUR ANALYSIS FOUND\n\nThe novel coronavirus itself does not distinguish between Black and white Americans. But virtually every other aspect of U.S. society does, including the nation\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nOur analysis revealed that, in many cities, testing sites in and near predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are likely to serve far more patients than those near predominantly white areas.\n\nA similar disparity exists between richer and poorer neighborhoods, our analysis showed: Testing resources were more scarce in poorer areas, with fewer sites per person and sites located farther away. And the disparity could be even greater in real life, considering wealthier people could also get tested by private practitioners who are less likely to be reflected in our analysis.\n\nKevin Ahmaad Jenkins, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics who has been researching the impact of COVID-19 testing center availability on communities of color, told ABC News and FiveThirtyEight that his team found that testing sites serving minority communities in big cities are fewer in number, have longer lines and often run out of tests. The impact of such disparities, he said, is evident in the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate effect on people of color.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just as clear as George Floyd\u2019s video. These numbers are right in front us: We are dying at disproportionate rates,\u201d he said.\n\nTo better understand the extent of this problem, we looked for cities whose broader \u201curbanized area\u201d had at least 1 million residents. (\u201cUrbanized area\u201d is a census designation for cities and the densely populated areas immediately surrounding them.) We then calculated the potential level of demand at each testing site in that area, based on the number of people living nearby and additional sites in the area.\n\nWe assumed that people would want to get tested at nearby sites, so we compared the number of patients a site would serve if the population of each census block group tried to visit sites that were close to them. This value, which we will refer to as potential patient demand, reflects how many people live near a given site and how many other options those people have.\n\nThe disparities we found varied in severity across the country. In some major urbanized areas, they\u2019re small or nonexistent. But in others \u2014 from Dallas to Miami to San Diego and many places in between \u2014 majority-Black and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods faced far more competition for COVID-19 testing than their white neighbors. Disparities were also seen in some predominantly Asian or Pacific Islander communities, such as those in Washington, D.C., Minneapolis and Riverside, Calif., but they weren\u2019t as widespread as those among Black and Hispanic communities.\n\nAnd our calculation of potential demand for testing at some sites in those underserved neighborhoods is likely an underestimation: Based on our reporting, many of the testing sites in those neighborhoods are government-funded community sites. These sites are set up to close the gaps in testing access in different communities, but they tend to be very popular among people from all across the county or urban area because they are often free and don\u2019t require an appointment.\n\nWe used data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2014-18 American Community Survey five-year estimates to figure out if, within urbanized areas, block groups that were majority Black or majority Hispanic were more likely to be close to sites with higher potential patient demand than majority-white block groups. To compare neighborhoods, we created a measure that we call potential community need, which is an average of the potential demand at nearby test sites. We also examined how block groups with a median income in the top 25 percent compared to those with median incomes in the bottom 25 percent.\n\nCastlight\u2019s set of testing site locations is among the most comprehensive data available, but compiling every testing location in the nation is a massive undertaking, as sites are constantly opening, closing and moving. Given that, the data set is likely missing some testing sites. Additionally, our analysis is based on testing site data as of June 18, so many new sites have been added nationwide since then \u2014 and others have likely closed or moved. We conducted separate analyses using a different source of testing site locations and examined other testing-related data to corroborate our findings.\n\nWe\u2019ve highlighted some of the cities with the most emblematic trends below. While we\u2019re confident in the trends we\u2019re presenting, we\u2019d encourage you to think of them more as estimates (akin to a fire marshal\u2019s approximation of the size of a crowd at a political rally) than exact measurements (such as a baseball player\u2019s batting average). For more detail on our methodology, and some of the limitations in the data and thus this analysis, see here.\n\nHowever, this analysis still provides a vivid snapshot of the hurdles, complications and shortfalls in American efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 this summer, a time when increased testing capacity in minority and low-income areas could have slowed the disease \u2014 a point widely acknowledged by public health experts.\n\n\u201cTesting site distribution and capacity is a direct reflection of the inequalities in our existing health care system,\u201d said John Brownstein, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard Medical School whose team of researchers at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Computational Epidemiology Lab also looked into the health care disparities underlying geographic access to testing. \u201cThe lack of access for those most vulnerable to infections will only serve to intensify the impact of this pandemic.\u201d\n\nTEXAS\n\nKenneth Hamilton, 31, had been waiting for four hours in the line to take a COVID-19 test at Houston\u2019s NRG Stadium.\n\nEventually, after spotting several people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, Hamilton \u2014 a small business owner and father of seven \u2014 decided that continuing to wait wasn\u2019t worth the risk of being exposed to coronavirus in the line itself. So he left, and looked for other testing options in his neighborhood.\n\nBut as a Black resident of Houston\u2019s Third Ward, the line Hamilton left was, at the time, his only nearby option. Three months after he first sought a test, he says there are considerably more testing centers in his neighborhood.\n\n\u201cOne of the schools that my kids go to, and one of the schools close by in the neighborhood, and a couple of churches now have them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey ramped up, to an extent.\u201d\n\nThe Houston urbanized area is just as diverse as many other major Texas metropolitan areas, but the city\u2019s initial plans to spread testing centers out equally across its neighborhoods while still operating at capacity helped to reduce site demand. As a result, the community demands of various neighborhoods were fairly equal. ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis showed that, on average, predominantly Black Houston neighborhoods faced similar levels of potential need as white neighborhoods. Hispanic neighborhoods had slightly higher potential community need than white neighborhoods, but not by much.\n\nBut the disparities are still clearly visible in the San Antonio and Dallas areas.\n\nSAN ANTONIO\n\nIn the San Antonio urbanized area, testing sites in poorer, majority-Black and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods in the south, east and west are estimated to have to serve far more people than sites in more affluent, whiter neighborhoods in the north, resulting in a disparity in potential community need.\n\nAccording to our analysis, of the roughly 45 sites that were actively testing in San Antonio in mid-June, several sites with the lowest potential patient demand were concentrated in the northern neighborhoods of Stone Oak and The Dominion, as well as the areas surrounding Friedrich Wilderness Park, which are all majority-white communities that boast median household incomes ranging from around $100,000 to $150,000.\n\nIn comparison, many of the busiest sites are scattered in San Antonio\u2019s more densely populated downtown, where the median income ranged from just $15,000 to about $40,000.\n\nThroughout the San Antonio urbanized area, predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods had an average potential community need twice as large as white neighborhoods; the disparity in between majority-Black and majority-white neighborhoods was even larger.\n\nExperts say that the disparity can be attributed to a long-standing gap in the health care system and an unequal distribution of health care facilities in the San Antonio area, which is one of the most economically segregated cities in the country.\n\nRecognizing testing disparities in different communities, the city identified underserved neighborhoods based on its equity matrix, and put together three cost-free pop-up sites that rotate around different parts of the city every week, according to its health department.\n\nNot only are government sites falling short of their ability to meet the public need for tests, but they themselves have become part of the disparity by concentrating demand even as they seek to address it in underserved neighborhoods. San Antonio\u2019s walk-up sites do not require a doctor\u2019s referral and, as a result, have become massively popular among those who do not otherwise have access to testing.\n\nIn late June, Jennifer Herriott, the deputy director of the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District, told us that people have lined up hours before these pop-up sites even open and that one time they had to turn down 275 people after running out of tests.\n\nHerriott said that as the demand for testing spiked, with cases and hospitalization rates across the state setting new records on an almost daily basis, the city and the county have been working to ramp up testing capacity. The pop-up sites that used to run only three days a week now operate six days a week, and each site\u2019s capacity has been increased from about 150-200 tests per day to 350.\n\nStill, the long lines remain in some places, and sites continue to run out of tests.\n\n\u201cPublic health and our partnership with San Antonio Fire [Department] has consistently had its eye on making sure that we\u2019re serving our Black and brown communities,\u201d Herriott said. \u201cAs our needs increase here, we\u2019ve increased free testing and those walk-ups and the Freeman drive-thru so we make sure that communities that might not be able to access testing are able to access testing.\u201d\n\nDALLAS\n\nDallas County and Tarrant County, two counties of nearly 4.7 million people that cover much of the Dallas urbanized area, have together reported over 64,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus so far. Our data showed that in early summer, the testing infrastructure of the Dallas urbanized area \u2014 which encompasses the cities of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington \u2014 resembled that of San Antonio: Local and state providers, as well as private hospitals, favored people living in whiter and wealthier parts of the county, towards the north, more than those living in the less affluent areas in the south.\n\nAcross the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington urbanized area, our analysis found that majority-Black neighborhoods had a potential community need 46 percent higher than majority-white neighborhoods; majority-Hispanic neighborhoods had a potential need 24 percent higher.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a compounding problem beyond just where the sites are,\u201d said Judge Clay Jenkins, the chief elected official in Dallas County. \u201cThe people that tend to have insurance are in the north and those that tend to not have insurance are in the south. We\u2019ve planned to put the majority of our testing in places where there\u2019s high uninsured.\u201d\n\nTake the University Park neighborhood of Dallas, where the median household income is $214,000 and almost 90 percent of the residents are white. It has at least five testing sites around the neighborhood, according to Castlight data. Appointments are required at most of them, per Castlight, which helps organize the speed at which people are able to get tested every day (walk-in testing centers tend to have longer lines).\n\nIt\u2019s a vastly different situation in Lancaster in southeast Dallas County, which has about 15,000 more residents than University Park but where Black people make up 69 percent of the population and the median household income is $53,000. Residents hoping to get a coronavirus test in the Lancaster area had to travel at least seven miles to the nearest drive-thru testing center until recently, when a nearby Walmart Supercenter opened up a drive-thru site.\n\nTo address the disparities, the city of Dallas asked the private sector to step up its support in the areas of the city most in need of more testing.\n\n\u201cA lot of the private providers are set up in northern Dallas, and it does highlight the existing disparities in the city,\u201d said Tristan Hallman, a spokesman for Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson. \u201cIn response, we\u2019ve asked Walgreens, CVS, Kroger to locate their facilities in southern Dallas, and they\u2019ve done so.\u201d\n\nIndeed, public health experts said the issue of unequal access to testing is a direct result of long-standing decisions made by private-sector companies and entrepreneurs when selecting which neighborhoods to open new businesses in. And the disparity is exacerbated by the fact that underserved communities are less likely to have the health insurance or financial resources necessary to seek costly testing from private providers when community sites are not accessible.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly driven by systematic health care injustice and it\u2019s actually very clearly delineated in Dallas because of gentrification and all of the social aspects of our community,\u201d said Katelyn Jetelina, a professor at the UTHealth School of Public Health in Dallas. \u201cWe need to figure out how to supplement the cost so that families in south Dallas don\u2019t have to decide whether they\u2019re having dinner or have to go get a COVID test.\u201d\n\nEven as more testing sites have been set up in underserved communities, new coronavirus hot spots flared up over the summer as communities began to reopen; now, a lack of tests and long lines have created major problems all over the country.\n\nFurther south, along the border in Hidalgo, Texas, Isaac Garza waited 10 hours in line to get a coronavirus test after visiting several recently reopened restaurants he oversees. As he has diabetes, an underlying condition, he didn\u2019t want to take any chances, and was relieved when his test results came back negative.\n\nBut the limited testing options in his community creates problems for Garza\u2019s staff, too. Every day, Garza said, he receives calls from employees showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 who tell him that they might have to miss critical work hours to wait in line for a test.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been challenging to do business and just to live day in and day out with all this because you\u2019re trying to protect your family, you\u2019re trying to protect your employees,\u201d he said.\n\nPHILADELPHIA\n\nFuneral director John Price, 72, had just gotten a break after a long day picking up bodies of COVID-19 victims from local hospitals in June. So he thought it was the perfect time to get tested himself for the coronavirus.\n\nPrice pulled his car into a line of approximately 300 others waiting for a test at a church parking lot on Cheltenham Avenue in North Philadelphia. Two hours in, he started getting calls from clients who had just lost loved ones to COVID-19. Another hour into his attempt to get a test, Price realized that he just couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\n\n\u201cI had to pull out of the line, because I had people who were calling me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was probably going to be another two or three hours before they got to me. If they got to me.\u201d\n\nHe went another week without getting a COVID-19 test until he stumbled upon a walk-in testing site organized by Dr. Ala Stanford\u2019s Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, which was offering the tests for free.\n\n\u201cA lot of people weren\u2019t notified of how they can actually get testing,\u201d said Price, recalling confusion amongst residents when the outbreak first began in the predominantly Black neighborhood of West Powelton, where his funeral home is based. \u201cIt was more like word of mouth, \u2018Oh this organization is doing it today over here, or so-and-so is doing it today over there.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven today, as the coronavirus crisis intensifies nationally, predominantly Black neighborhoods in the Philadelphia urbanized area, which extends into New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, have fewer testing centers than their wealthier and whiter counterparts.\n\nOther researchers, conducting independent analyses of other data, observed the same phenomenon we did regarding the demands placed on testing sites in majority-white and majority-Black neighborhoods at the city level, despite the fact that Black Philadelphians make up a plurality of COVID-19 test recipients in the city.\n\nDrawing on his own study of access to COVID-19 tests in various Philadelphia neighborhoods, which he has been tracking since the outbreak began, Drexel University epidemiologist Dr. Usama Bilal found that testing disparities are often a product of existing systemic inequalities. Rates of testing, he said, were lower in poorer areas and areas with higher proportions of residents who are racial minorities. Testing access improved throughout the city in April and May, Bilal found, but as cases start to resurface and the demand for tests rises, he worries the city will backslide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been observing that testing access is going the wrong way again,\u201d he said. \u201cTesting is becoming more concentrated in wealthier areas in Philadelphia, and we have observed a similar pattern in Chicago and New York.\u201d\n\nA Philadelphia public health department spokesman denied that testing is increasingly inaccessible to racial minorities and said that the city has been focused on expanding resources in underserved communities, citing services like the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, which recently received city funding to conduct free coronavirus tests.\n\nBut Stanford, the surgeon who heads the consortium, said she worried that as the demand for testing increases nationwide, the share of tests she will be able to offer free of charge will fall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here in the sun, in the rain, doing whatever we can do in a mobile unit begging for supplies from everywhere else in the United States, waiting 10 days to get our results back,\u201d she said. \u201cBut yet, in some of the best hospitals in the nation you have an in-house test that the residents of this city do not uniformly have access to. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the city\u2019s public health department, Philadelphia has conducted more than 166,000 COVID-19 tests. Black residents account for 40 percent of the city\u2019s COVID-19 tests, more than any other racial group tested and about equal to the share of Philadelphia that is Black, per city data.\n\nBilal\u2019s research, however, now finds that in predominantly Black and highly populated areas like the Oxford Circle neighborhood of Philadelphia, where the median household income is $41,000, just 60.9 per every 1,000 people are now getting tested. Compare that to the more affluent and plurality white Center City neighborhoods, where testing rates are now 133 per every 1,000 people, according to Bilal.\n\n\u201cThe epidemic that we really need to control long term is social inequality,\u201d said Bilal as the coronavirus outbreak in Philadelphia first took hold. \u201cIt has many different intersecting axes. So there is racism: that is places, that is classism, that is gender discrimination, there are many, many things going on there.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Philadelphia area illustrates the extent to which disparities in coronavirus testing access grow out of systemic inequality in American society. Philadelphia is one of the poorest big cities in the nation, with about 25 percent of residents living below the poverty line. Bilal found that while the distribution of testing sites in Philadelphia has vastly improved from where it was at the beginning of the outbreak \u2014 with multiple options now available for residents in even the poorest areas \u2014 Black Americans in many low-income areas are still likely to find it difficult to get a COVID-19 test. Our analysis of the sites active in mid-June confirmed this.\n\nIn Kingsessing, a southwestern neighborhood that\u2019s around 80 percent Black, there\u2019s only one COVID-19 testing site, and that site has limited testing hours. Meanwhile, in the Center City area, there are several sites \u2014 some within a short walking distance of each other.\n\nAs is the situation in Philadelphia, many cities are now responding to calls to provide more resources to communities of color by increasing the number of pop-up sites to accommodate residents and ease the demand for more tests.\n\nSOUTH FLORIDA\n\nMartin Torres waited seven hours in line for a COVID-19 test at Hard Rock Stadium, an open-air venue best known as the home of the Miami Dolphins, while showing what he believed to be symptoms of the virus. When he finally reached the front, he was told he\u2019d get results back in five days.\n\nTwo weeks later, he is still waiting.\n\n\u201cI am kind of in a limbo waiting for when I can have a response for that,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nIn a statement responding to the demand in testing and the slower turnaround times, Quest Diagnostics, one of the major labs processing COVID-19 tests, said it will \u201ccontinue to ramp up capacity to reach 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests a day.\u201d\n\nFlorida, where the pandemic has recently spiked to nearly 370,000 confirmed cases, expanded testing capacity in response to problems surrounding testing access equity. But being a resident of a lower-income neighborhood still presents a challenge in terms of getting a COVID-19 test.\n\nThe South Florida region, which the census refers to as the Miami urbanized area, contains at least part of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, and has deep disparities in testing site availability in majority-Black, majority-Hispanic and majority-white neighborhoods, according to our analysis.\n\nThe neighborhoods included in the Miami urbanized area also have massive economic inequality, and disparities exist within different Hispanic communities. Yet the few testing sites in wealthy areas \u2014 such as Cooper City, a majority-white town located in Broward County just north of Miami-Dade \u2014 had a much smaller potential patient demand than sites in many of the more densely populated lower-income neighborhoods, many of which are majority Black or Hispanic.\n\nOn average, majority-Black areas had a potential community need 13 percent larger than majority-white census blocks. In majority-Hispanic areas, it was 29 percent larger, with the densely populated, predominantly Hispanic areas around South Miami showing a particularly high potential need.\n\nJust 10 miles south of Cooper City is Miami Gardens, a predominantly Black area in Miami-Dade County where the median household income is less than half that of Cooper City. If residents there want to get a test, they have to travel to Hard Rock Stadium and wait in a line that officials have advised could be as long as four hours in a summer heat that sometimes nears 100 degrees.\n\nThe long lines cause other problems, too. On most days at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site, it is not uncommon for testing to temporarily pause due to lightning in the area or because a car waiting in line breaks down due to mechanical issues.\n\n\u201cWe have seen cars run out of gas at some of the busier test sites, but we tell people that a little bit of planning and a lot of patience are required,\u201d said Mike Jachals, a state spokesman for several of the federally supported testing sites across the state.\n\nIn an emailed statement to ABC News and FiveThirtyEight, a state emergency management spokesman said Florida \u201cis continuing to increase COVID-19 testing daily.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said the county has made \u201ca concerted effort\u201d to put more testing facilities in lower-income communities throughout the county. As part of that effort, new pop-up sites at the Joseph Caleb Center in central Miami and Harris Field Park in south Miami-Dade, both located in predominantly Black or Hispanic areas, have been installed.\n\nIn Miramar, a city of about 140,000 just north of the Hard Rock Stadium, there\u2019s only one public COVID-19 testing center even though it happens to be the city with one of the largest percentages of Black people in Broward County. The city received the state funding necessary to open its first state-supported testing site just over a month ago, which local officials believe was far too late.\n\n\u201cInitially, I was very concerned, very upset,\u201d said Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam in response to a question about the lack of urgency in establishing testing facilities in the city. \u201cIt was very disappointing and upsetting, but I was actually happy once we did get the call notifying me that we would have the site and since that determination was made, we\u2019ve made the best of that site. It would have been ideal to have it up since the onset.\u201d\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA\n\nAfter touting a massive expansion of testing and stable case counts earlier this summer, California has in recent weeks been rolling back on its earlier promise of easy access to testing for every resident.\n\nCoronavirus hot spots in Southern California, in particular, are now putting back restrictions on community testing to prioritize symptomatic patients or those most at risk, such as nursing home residents and staff members.\n\nBased on ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis and reporting, communities of color and lower income-level neighborhoods in the San Diego and Los Angeles urbanized areas \u2014 where some of the biggest gaps in potential community need were seen between majority-white and majority-Black neighborhoods \u2014 are expected to suffer the most from the testing restrictions.\n\nAccording to our analysis of site locations in mid-June, in both the San Diego and Los Angeles areas, majority-Black neighborhoods were estimated to have around 30 percent higher potential need than majority-white neighborhoods.\n\nSAN DIEGO\n\nIn the San Diego urbanized area, much of which falls within the coastal section of San Diego County, many of the sites with lower potential patient demand are located in the predominantly white and wealthy neighborhoods along the northern part of the coast, while the sites expected to serve more people were all in the poorer, predominantly Black communities in the southern end of the city of San Diego.\n\nMost of the community sites in San Diego County, which tend to be busier than private sites, are by appointment, county Health and Human Services Agency spokesperson Tim McClain said, and with the recent spike in cases people have had to make appointments a week or more in advance.\n\nThat was the case for Holly Young, who lives in La Mesa, a suburb just east of the city of San Diego. Young, 60, said she sought testing earlier this month after she discovered that her son and his girlfriend had been in contact with a COVID-positive friend prior to seeing her.\n\nShe said her health care provider was unable to test her because she didn\u2019t show any symptoms, so she turned to a county testing site, for which she had to wait almost 10 days just to book an appointment and then drive an hour and 15 minutes to get to the site.\n\n\u201cI am in an essential industry, and part of my job is making the bank deposits, going to the post office and other routine tasks that were outside the business,\u201d said Young, who is a self-employed accountant with clients in retail. \u201cSo even though I was always masked, I still felt very vulnerable. I\u2019m overweight, take blood pressure medication and I smoked for 20 years, so I am not at all confident I would survive COVID-19.\u201d\n\nYoung was tested on July 11, and told she\u2019ll get her results in five to seven business days. But she went off a two-week self-quarantine last Thursday, meaning she had to return to work before getting her test results.\n\nThe disparity in access to tests hasn\u2019t been lost on Young, who said she is on Obamacare and does not get health care from her job: \u201cWe all know people who just call their doctor and get a test the next day. It shouldn\u2019t be this way.\u201d\n\nMcClain said San Diego County is exceeding state guidelines and offers widespread free and public testing access, but intends to do more to meet increasing public demand and reach deeper into at-risk communities. As of July 6, the county was surpassing the state goal of 4,950 daily tests \u2014 1.5 tests per day per every 1,000 residents \u2014 by 56 percent.\n\n\u201cAs tests became more widely available in spring, the county placed the greatest concentration of testing in our communities of diversity, and those near the border, and continues to bring more sites online,\u201d McClain said. \u201cTesting access is widely dispersed but we intend to make it more convenient with new locations, will add sites to address hotspots and will bring more no-appointment locations online.\u201d\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nThe Los Angeles area has also managed to at least narrow some of the disparities. The poorer urban centers of Los Angeles were estimated to have greater community need than the relatively wealthier suburbs outside the city, as well as in Pasadena, though to a lesser degree.\n\nSince California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an aggressive expansion of the statewide testing capacity back in late April, the state has also significantly ramped up testing in underserved communities, setting up close to 100 state-supported community sites in its communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods. According to our analysis, predominantly Asian communities actually had less potential demand than other groups, including white neighborhoods.\n\nThat expansion appears to have helped collapse testing disparities in the region, according to our analysis of testing data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\n\nAt the end of April, mostly white cities and communities in Los Angeles County had, on average, more than 1,200 tests completed per 100,000 people. That was more than 65 percent more completed tests than communities of color.\n\nAfter Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced free COVID-19 testing for everyone in the county and expanded testing operations, the number of tests administered tripled.\n\nA month later, the racial testing gap had shrunk to just 24 percent between the most-white areas and the least white. About 6,200 tests per 100,000 people were completed in whiter areas and about 5,000 tests per 100,000 people in less white areas, according to the analysis of the city\u2019s testing data.\n\nThere was a similar pattern in wealthier and poorer areas. At the end of April, people were tested at a rate 60 percent higher in areas where the median household income was in the top quartile versus the bottom quartile. But by May 31, that gap had shrunk to just 13 percent.\n\nSince April, California has scaled up its statewide testing capacity from just 2,000 tests per day to more than 100,000 now, and has completed nearly 4.8 million tests since the pandemic began, the state\u2019s health department spokesperson told ABC News and FiveThirtyEight.\n\nAs cases and hospitalizations hit new records in the past couple weeks, however, the state is again struggling with testing capacity. The governor last week issued a new advisory to hospitals and labs, asking them to prioritize testing turnaround for individuals who are most at risk of spreading the virus to others, including those in nursing homes and congregate living settings.\n\nThe Castlight data analysis has helped shed light on the racial, ethnic and income disparities in the allocation of COVID-19 testing resources, and ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s reporting shows how gaps created by systemic inequity in the health care system continue to persist even as states, cities and counties step up efforts to address them.\n\nAs cases rise and states across the country begin to face testing constraints, more local governments and private providers say they are considering going back to prioritizing testing access to symptomatic patients and those most at risk. In some places, such as Sacramento, Calif., and Omaha, Neb., testing sites are even closing because of supply shortages. This is expected to create additional strain on testing for underserved communities as state or county-sponsored public sites and labs further limit testing access.\n\n\u201cOur response to COVID is a reflection of the existing biases we have in our healthcare system,\u201d said John Brownstein, the epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWhile governments are trying to close the gap, we still have a long way to go to make sure Americans have equal access to testing resources.\u201d\n\nFor Dr. Ala Stanford and her colleagues at the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium in Philadelphia, the choice early on was clear: adjust to a new normal of life indoors, or move swiftly to implement testing on the streets of Philadelphia to combat a virus that was proving deadly to Black communities.\n\nStanford says she felt compelled to respond as she did because she knew that the same health care disparities she learned about in medical school, and as a practicing doctor, were still at play in Philadelphia during the coronavirus crisis \u2014 the city in which she\u2019s spent her entire life.\n\n\u201cI stopped and said to myself: I\u2019m a business owner in private practice, I have access, I can order these lab kits like anybody else, I know where the people are that are hurting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am not afraid to go there.\u201d\n\nABC News\u2019 Briana Stewart and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Rachael Dottle contributed reporting.\n\nCLARIFICATION (July 23, 2020, 3:50 p.m.): This story has been updated to avoid using the phrase \u201cpeople of color\u201d for Hispanic people, some of whom are white.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-neighborhoods-have-more-access-to-covid-19-testing-sites/", "author": ["Soo Rin Kim", "Matthew Vann", "Laura Bronner", "Grace Manthey"]}, {"title": "How We Analyzed 7,914 COVID-19 Testing Sites And Found Racial Disparities", "text": "For our story on the distribution of COVID-19 testing sites, we wanted to develop a measure of how busy coronavirus testing sites were likely to be.

Every Risk Is A Decision.", "text": "It has been a summer of compromises, a season of bending the rules. If I wear a mask and I keep my distance, I can go for a walk with a friend. Hand sanitizer is a bulwark that allows my kids to play on an otherwise empty jungle gym. I believe the backyard has magical properties that will, probably, make it just safe enough to see people and talk to them. In the sun and fresh breeze, we give each other air hugs from six-ish feet away.\n\nMeanwhile, my hair grows, untrimmed, past my clavicle. When my friend, in some ways far more stringent on her social distancing and mask wearing than I am, told me about going in for her first cut since March, I winced involuntarily. I assume it\u2019s roughly the same face that she made when I confessed my masked trip to a clothing store to buy some summer dresses. Both of us know the safest thing \u2014 the thing most likely to prevent the spread of COVID-19 \u2014 would be to stay at home, alone. But we know we won\u2019t do that now. Can\u2019t do it. The idea of sticking with the safest thing has become almost as unthinkable as indulging in the danger of a movie in a theater or a drink at the bar. But in between those extremes, life has become a sticky bog in which we wade through evidence and convenience, hoping we\u2019re stepping on solid ground.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nWe can\u2019t live like we did before coronavirus. We won\u2019t live like we did immediately after it appeared, either. Instead, we\u2019re in the muddy middle, faced with choices that seem at once crucial and impossible, simple and massively complicated. These choices are an everyday occurrence, but they also carry a moral weight that makes them feel different than picking a pasta sauce or a pair of shoes. In a pandemic that\u2019s been filled with unanswerable questions and unwinnable wars, this is our daily Kobayashi Maru. And no one can tell us exactly what we ought to do.\n\nNot that there haven\u2019t been attempts at providing structure.\n\nRight now, you can go online and find multiple charts that will visually categorize what were once the activities of daily life by risk level. Some of these charts are evidence based, compiled by experts and (in my opinion) genuinely helpful. I particularly liked the one designed by epidemiologist Saskia Popescu and bioethecist Ezekiel Emanuel because it lays out not just the risk levels of various behaviors \u2014 getting a haircut, visiting the dentist, buying a new shirt \u2014 but also the underlying factors that can make an activity more or less risky. In general, research has shown that indoors is riskier than outside, long visits riskier than short ones, crowds riskier than individuals \u2014 and, look, just avoid situations where you\u2019re being sneezed, yelled, coughed or sung at.\n\nBut the trouble with the muddy middle is that a general idea of what is riskier isn\u2019t the same thing as a clear delineation between right and wrong. These charts \u2014 even the best ones \u2014 aren\u2019t absolute arbiters of safety: They\u2019re the result of surveying experts. In the case of Popescu\u2019s chart, the risk categorizations were assigned based on discussions among herself, Emanuel and Dr. James P. Phillips, the chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University Emergency Medicine. They each independently assigned a risk level to each activity, and then hashed out the ones on which they disagreed.\n\nTake golf. How safe is it to go out to the links? Initially, the three experts had different risk levels assigned to this activity because they were all making different assumptions about what a game of golf naturally involved, Popescu said. \u201cAre people doing it alone? If not, how many people are in a cart? Are they wearing masks? Are they drinking? \u2026. those little variables that can increase the risk,\u201d she told me.\n\nGolf isn\u2019t just golf. It\u2019s how you golf that matters.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nThose variables and assumptions aren\u2019t trivial to calculating risk. Nor are they static. There\u2019s different muck under your boggy feet in different parts of the country, at different times. For instance, how safe is it to eat outdoors with friends? Popescu\u2019s chart ranks \u201coutdoor picnic or porch dining\u201d with people outside your household as low risk \u2014 a very validating categorization, personally. But a chart produced by the Texas Medical Association, based on a survey of its 53,000 physician members, rates \u201cattending a backyard barbeque\u201d as a moderate risk, a 5 on a scale in which 9 is the stuff most of us have no problem eschewing.\n\nWhen we first noticed this apparent contradiction at FiveThirtyEight, some of us joked about how maybe a Texas barbecue wasn\u2019t the same thing as a picnic in New York or Minnesota. Ha ha, everything\u2019s bigger in Texas, even the guest list. But, come to find out, yeah, that\u2019s actually exactly the deal.\n\n[Related: How To Make Indoor Air Safer]\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of social distancing. And different sauce,\u201d said Mark Casanova, a Dallas palliative care specialist and member of the Texas Medical Association\u2019s COVID-19 task force, summing up what makes a Texas barbecue different. When he rated a backyard barbecue, he was thinking of a crowded event, where people roam from indoors to out and back again, and masks are scarce. When he was ranking risk, he was trying to think about real-world behavior, not necessarily the way to do each activity most safely. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a bar and saying, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll just sit by myself.\u2019\u201d Casanova said.\n\nExperts like Popescu and Casanova have focused on harm reduction \u2014 the same philosophy that leads thousands of American gym teachers to demonstrate putting condoms on bananas. We know, from basic understandings of human behavior, that people are going to do a thing (have sex, that is, not put condoms on a banana). So how can we help them be safer?\n\nBut we\u2019re used to safer sex \u2014 we\u2019re not used to safer daily existence. The muddy middle is frustrating not because we\u2019ve never found ourselves in this type of quagmire before, but because the scale of the swamp is so vast and because, just yesterday, it was a garden.\n\n[Related: Why It Took So Long For Politicians To Treat The Child Care Crisis As A Crisis]\n\nWe are faced with too many choices \u2014 not just what to do, but how to do it and when and where. The stakes are high, 140,000 people are dead in the U.S. and death rates are starting to climb again. And because of those stakes, we\u2019ve assigned a morality to all these choices \u2014 something that psychology researchers have shown leads us to frame things as \u201call good\u201d or \u201call bad\u201d and lose sight of the gray areas all around us. We\u2019re all bogged down and floundering, questioning our own goodness while we arch our eyebrows at our friends and argue over whose patch of muck is really solid ground.\n\nIn some ways, it would be easier to just not care, to be one of those people who see no difference among a park, a swamp and the rim of an active volcano, to be one of those people who is mentally living six months ago. Then I could cheerfully traipse from my backyard to a neighbor\u2019s driveway and then on to a dark corner booth somewhere with no worries. No stress. It would hardly even be a decision. Maybe I could even get angry about stores and cities setting up rules and see something like a mask requirement as a violation of my freedoms. Then I could be oblivious to the far more terrible freedom of the muddy middle \u2014 where everything is a choice, and they\u2019re all mine to make and to live with.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-decision-is-a-risk-every-risk-is-a-decision/", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"title": "How To Make Indoor Air Safer", "text": "If you\u2019re waiting for a break from bad news about COVID, don\u2019t hold your breath \u2014 or, actually, do hold your breath.\n\nExperts have understood for months that the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, can be spread by hitching a ride inside large respiratory droplets that are expelled when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. But there\u2019s growing evidence that smaller airborne particles called aerosols can carry and spread the virus, too.\n\nThe methods for preventing spread from respiratory droplets are familiar: social distancing, frequent hand-washing and wearing a mask. But the methods for stopping aerosols, which are lightweight and may be able to hang in the air for hours, are less obvious and often rely on technology. But can something like an air filter really stop a seemingly unstoppable pandemic?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. The larger respiratory droplets that are known to spread the coronavirus are larger bits of spit and mucus that a person propels outward when they forcefully exhale. If the person is infectious, these droplets can be spiked with virus particles which, if they can find their way to your nose, mouth or eyes, can enter your body and cause infection. The droplets are between 5 and 10 microns across (a human hair is, on average, roughly 70 microns in diameter), and they\u2019re heavy, as far as bodily secretions go, so they quickly fall to the floor \u2014 or nearby surface, or nearby facial orifice. But when we talk or laugh or sing or even just breathe, we also produce smaller, lighter droplets (less than 5 microns) that evaporate before gravity can do its thing, causing the dried remnants to stay aloft like a microscopic feather.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, experts weren\u2019t sure if these aerosols could contain enough virus or hang around long enough to actually infect anybody. A person can\u2019t be infected by inhaling one or two viruses \u2014 they need to be exposed to a certain concentration of the virus before it can gain a foothold, though experts still aren\u2019t sure what this threshold, called the infectious dose, is. But now there\u2019s growing evidence that, yes, the aerosols carry the virus and, in a high enough concentration, can cause infection.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a process of elimination. You get to the point where you say, \u2018It sort of looks like aerosol transmission,\u2019\u201d said Lisa M. Brosseau, a research consultant at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. \u201cIn the midst of a pandemic, that\u2019s what you have. You take what evidence you have, what you can observe, and you draw conclusions from that.\u201d\n\nWhen people are outside, aerosol transmission is less of a concern because in wide-open spaces, these particles are quickly dispersed and diluted, making it difficult for an infectious concentration to accumulate, Brosseau said. It\u2019s like dropping some food coloring into a river. But indoors, especially if the ventilation is poor, it\u2019s much easier for aerosols to accumulate \u2014 more like dropping food coloring into a birdbath.\n\nSometimes, though, you can\u2019t avoid taking a dip in those murky waters. The good news is there are ways to dilute and clear out aerosols from indoor spaces. But it requires more effort.\n\nOpening a window can help because it forces fresh air in, and some of the contaminated air will make its way outside. \u201cThere is no doubt that, over time, on average, the concentration of aerosols is going to go down if you open up the windows,\u201d said Rajat Mittal, a mechanical engineering professor who studies aerodynamics at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBut if you\u2019re, say, sitting in a classroom in Minnesota in January, or Arizona in September, opening up the windows might not be the most practical solution.\n\nInstead, school boards and offices should look to their heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. But you can\u2019t just shuffle air around the building \u2014 that could spread the virus to even more places. Instead, you have to replace the air itself.\n\n\u201cYou can achieve an air change by one of two ways,\u201d said David Krause, a certified industrial hygienist and the owner of HealthCare Consulting and Contracting. The first is \u201cthrough the gross changeout of air, bringing in outside air and exhausting air from the room. Or you can achieve it by using high-efficiency filters that effectively remove virus-containing particles from the air.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nFilters can capture virus-laden particles through a number of methods, including physically trapping them with a fine enough filter and using electrostatic attraction to charge particles and force them to settle out of the air.\n\nTo catch the tiny aerosols that might be carrying the coronavirus, filters need a high enough MERV \u2014 yes, MERV. Surely you\u2019ve heard of the minimum efficiency reporting value before, no? A filter with a MERV rating of 1, for example, will capture less than 20 percent of particles that are 3 to 10 microns across. As the MERV rating increases, so does the number of particles it captures, along with the amount of force an HVAC system needs to push the air through the fine filter.\n\nTo effectively neutralize indoor transmission of the novel coronavirus, you\u2019d need a MERV of at least 13, according to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not recommending major modifications to most air conditioning systems. Many of them can simply change out one efficiency of filter for another,\u201d said William Bahnfleth, a professor of architectural engineering at Pennsylvania State University and the chair of ASHRAE\u2019s epidemic task force. \u201cI have MERV-13 filters in my home air conditioner.\u201d\n\nBut changing out the filter alone might not be enough. Krause pointed to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which were published before the COVID-19 pandemic, that outline exactly what standards buildings need to have to achieve \u201cairborne infection isolation,\u201d which means stopping the spread of aerosols smaller than 5 microns. At a minimum, buildings need to be reaching six air changes per hour, according to these CDC guidelines. Krause said the average commercial building now only performs one or two air changes per hour, and could squeeze in another with an air filtration system.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\n\u201cThe other four and a half or five air changes per hour, you\u2019re really going to have to rely on in-room, standalone, HEPA filter air cleaners,\u201d Krause said, referring to high efficiency particulate air filters. \u201cWe should be looking at these if we have any illusions of sending kids back to school.\u201d\n\nAll that filtration can be expensive, though. A commercial-sized MERV-13 filter can cost three to four times more than a lower-standard filter, and portable air cleaners can be up to $1,000 each, according to Krause, so the cost for offices and schools is not small. And using a filtration system creates a new risk for whoever has to change out the virus-soaked filters.\n\nStill, HVAC systems can\u2019t guarantee 100 percent safety. The idea behind all these air changes and filters is to dilute and clean the air so that aerosols can\u2019t build up into high concentrations. But it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that an aerosol will get sucked up by a filter or a ventilation system before it gets sucked up by a person, especially if a lot of people are close together for long periods of time.\n\nUltraviolet light filters could also help: UV light can kill microorganisms, including viruses, but the experts I spoke to raised concerns about this method. For one, killing the virus this way requires continually exposing it to UV light for several minutes \u2014 if it simply floats by a light, such as one in a vent, that might not be enough. For another, UV has other potential risks, including skin and eye damage.\n\nRegardless of what building managers choose to do, their efforts will be moot if people aren\u2019t also taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets by wearing masks, washing their hands frequently and practicing social distancing. All the open windows in the world can\u2019t help if you\u2019re swallowing globs of virus-laden spit.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci | FiveThirtyEight", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-make-indoor-air-safer/", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers"]}, {"title": "When Does A Pandemic Start To Erode Civil Liberties?", "text": "Mask mandates have become a polarizing issue across the country, from Arizona to Georgia.

But only recently has a broader swath of America tuned into the mess nestled inside it, one that parents have been sitting with for months: what to do with the kids.\n\nThere has been no federal plan to help American parents with child care, and they continue to wonder whether schools will really open their doors come the new school year. That lack of action is in direct contrast to other crises that have struck America recently. After the financial crash of 2008, there was a bailout and a stimulus plan. After the protests against police over the last few months, officials in cities and states responded with promises of better actions in the future but also, immediate policy implementation: New York state repealed a law that had shielded police personnel files, while the Minneapolis City Council voted to begin a process that could eventually lead to the dissolution of the city police as it\u2019s now known.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nBut on child care and school, a specific, urgent response has been missing, or at least one that acknowledges our new reality. President Trump threatened to withhold federal funding for education if schools didn\u2019t open back up, counter to schools\u2019 insistence they need more money to provide a safe education amid the pandemic. While the CARES Act, an omnibus COVID-19 relief bill signed into law in late March, gave extra stimulus funding to families with children, schools and child care businesses so they could remain afloat, a Democratic-backed bill to give a $50 billion bailout of the child care industry has gotten little attention. Teachers around the country have voiced doubt that necessary safety measures for in-school teaching will be sufficient, and Los Angeles Unified School District, one of the country\u2019s largest school systems, has decided not to reopen classrooms when schools go back in session in August. Some worry that while distance learning is safer, socially different children and those without stable internet connections or computers \u2014 who are already at the margins in normal times \u2014 will fall irrevocably behind.\n\nThere is no cohesive solution to America\u2019s child care problem. But the relative inattention to this crisis, one that\u2019s so foundational to a functioning society, the economy and family units across the country, is revealing. It shows that for all the changes that have happened in American life \u2014 more female elected officials, a MeToo movement and a workforce that is around 47 percent female \u2014 our power dynamics remain fundamentally skewed. We are failing to collectively understand what our most critical and pressing problems actually are.\n\n\u201cCare in general has always been seen as a sideline issue,\u201d Vicki Shabo of the left-leaning think tank New America said. \u201cA nice-to-have and not something that\u2019s necessary, and not something that\u2019s central for adults to be productive in the economy.\u201d Of course, now we\u2019re seeing how much of a misunderstanding that is. In a country where most men and women work even when they have children, having child care is inextricably linked to economic productivity \u2014 and not having it often hurts women most. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2015 found that in households with children under 6, women spent an hour a day doing child care, compared to the 25 minutes of care provided by men. It\u2019s easy to extrapolate this trend for pandemic times: American women will bear the brunt of the school and child care crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: COVID-19 deaths are rising. What will the U.S. do?\n\nYet, child care in particular hasn\u2019t often found itself at the forefront of political debate. Experts and activists I talked to for this story all used the same framing to talk about why: an American narrative that child care problems are individuals\u2019 problems, not society\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIf you think about child care traditionally before the pandemic, you probably didn\u2019t think about it too much before you had kids,\u201d Melissa Boteach, vice president of income security and child care at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said. \u201cThen you have kids, you\u2019re in the most stressful and resource-strapped part of your life: You\u2019re operating on three hours of sleep a night, you\u2019re financially squeezed, because at the very time you\u2019re taking off of work, you have diapers and wipes and formula and whatever else. You\u2019re in this total daze of early motherhood. That\u2019s probably not the time when you say, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to call my member of Congress.\u2019 You\u2019re feeling it like a personal issue.\u201d\n\nChild care isn\u2019t necessarily seen as a macroeconomic issue or a driver of labor force participation or GDP, Shabo said. And because of that, she said, it often takes a backseat to economic issues like wages when lobbying efforts happen. This is not to say that child care issues don\u2019t get attention \u2014 in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, which featured several female candidates, child care plans took a more front and center role in the campaign than they had in the past. One leading candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, co-authored a 2004 book, \u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d which was about the ways the rising incomes of households with two full-time employed adults belied the heavy costs of essentials like child care. Warren thought child care costs were among the reasons the American middle class was in an economic crisis.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\n\u201cOur workplaces were built for white men,\u201d said Danielle Atkinson, the founder and director of Mothering Justice, a Detroit-area advocacy group for working families. The fact that parents are left to fend for themselves from birth to kindergarten and then during the after-school, pre-dinner hours, is an American tradition that seems to assume a readily available, at-home caregiver. (Atkinson pointed out the inextricable role black women have played in American child care; enslaved women often took care of white children.) The nuclear family with a stay-at-home parent (usually a mother) is an ideal that persists, or at the very least lingers in American life: only 18 percent of Americans in a 2018 Pew Research Survey thought it was ideal for both parents to work full time.\n\n\u201cThis conversation about school is really a conversation about work,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cThe conversation about returning to school is not based on health. It\u2019s about returning those workers to working and not looking after their children, so those children have to be somewhere.\u201d Essential workers in particular are being forced to make difficult choices about their children\u2019s care \u2014 many essential-worker jobs are lower wage \u2014 and many child care providers are in strapped situations. The work of child care providers, Atkinson said, is often undervalued \u2014 their median annual wage in 2017 was a little more than $22,000 annually, which is just above the federal government\u2019s poverty line for a family of three \u2014 and as Boteach pointed out, those workers could continue to risk greater infection rates as schools and work open back up. She highlighted the plan put forth by Senate Democrats, the Child Care Is Essential Act \u2014 which would provide a bailout to the suffering industry and additional money for those providers to buy personal protective equipment \u2014 and cited an estimate that the U.S. child care industry would need a $9.6 billion injection monthly to survive the pandemic.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nIt\u2019s more likely the next governmental nod to parents and their school-age children will come in the next iteration of the omnibus coronavirus relief package. Congressional Democrats have proposed $350 billion in funds for schools and universities to purchase PPE and clean their facilities. Republicans agree about more funds, though it\u2019s not clear what their proposed number is \u2014 some have argued that since many schools will be operating on a partly virtual basis, less federal funding is needed.\n\nThe moral tussling that many parents have been doing \u2014 go back to work and risk potential COVID-19 infection at day care or school \u2014 will likely continue to be subjected to partisan politics. Trump and his Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have been the loudest voices in recent days about sending children back to school at all costs, much to the chagrin of teachers, many of whom feel ill-prepared for the safety precautions necessary for in-person pandemic teaching. Ultimately, though, it is parents who are forced to make a choice. Atkinson, a mother of six, told me she would be keeping her children home in the fall.\n\n[Related: The Latest Political Polls Collected By FiveThirtyEight]\n\nFor those who focus on child care, the pandemic has perversely presented an opportunity to advance the cause of greater access to guaranteed services. \u201cThis pandemic has created greater alignment of experience, potentially, between white middle class folks who saw this as an individual issue that they were struggling with and outraged by but hadn\u2019t really taken action on and the longtime, long-standing lived experience of lower wage folks and people of color who have struggled for decades with the unaffordability of child care and the lack of care options to meet their work schedules,\u201d Shabo said.\n\nAtkinson said she also hoped the individualism narrative would be shattered by the current crisis. \u201cWe want to lift the veil away and help women, especially white women, know that you\u2019ve been lied to. You were sold a bunch of lies: \u2018if you just work harder, if you just slay sexism, you\u2019ll be OK.\u2019 But really, it\u2019s a tool to divide,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pandemic has shattered norms and paradigms ever since it arrived in the U.S. \u2014 our expectations of child care is no exception.

The transcript below has been lightly edited.\n\nsarah (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Earlier today, President Trump tweeted that the 2020 election should be delayed \u201cuntil people can properly, securely and safely vote.\u201d\n\nPostponing the election, of course, is not something the president can legally do. But it\u2019s also kind of besides the point. Trump has already been fighting to delegitimize the results come November, claiming that voting by mail can lead to mass voter fraud.\n\nSo let\u2019s dive into that. How would you describe Trump\u2019s efforts to throw November\u2019s results into question? He did something similar in 2016 when facing Hillary Clinton. How is this different?\n\nclare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): Well, in many ways it\u2019s exactly what Trump was doing in 2016. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s president now. And thus, his words are even more damaging (and they were already very damaging in 2016).\n\ngeoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, elections analyst): There\u2019s also a very important distinction here. Before, Trump was just a candidate casting doubt on the election, but now he\u2019s a sitting president doing that.\n\njulia_azari (Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): I\u2019d characterize this as an exercise in control and influence over his party and the news cycle. Everyone is forced to respond to what he says, even if they\u2019re not responding positively. Trump isn\u2019t effective at that many aspects of the job, but he\u2019s pretty effective at agenda control.\n\nclare.malone: I would also say that calling for the delay of the actual vote feels VERY dictatorial in nature. Like, we\u2019ve perversely gotten used to the \u201cfake votes,\u201d \u201cfake news\u201d stuff. But encouraging a change in the election date feels sort of explicitly over a line.\n\nsarah: And to ask a somewhat obvious question \u2014 but one that has to be asked \u2014 this is another unprecedented, norm-defying and democratic-value jeopardizing moment, right? To put it another way, has another sitting president ever done this?\n\njulia_azari: I\u2019m always nervous about the \u201cnever\u201d question with past presidents, but yeah, most presidents have not been willing to take on all the formal rules, the legal system and other branches of government while in office. Congress \u2014 which has the power to change the date of an election \u2014 used to be stronger, too, and there was no Twitter. My go-to example for this is we still had a presidential election in 1864, during the Civil War.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: And in modern times, incumbents who have lost reelection have exited office without too much of a fuss. Take George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, or if we go further back, Herbert Hoover. Granted, incumbents don\u2019t often lose. So it\u2019s important to note that each of those incumbents lost decisively, meaning there wasn\u2019t much to stand on even if they had wanted to fight the result. But it\u2019s not like Gerald Ford created a stir in 1976 when he lost narrowly.\n\njulia_azari: Candidates have also conceded even when the election was a mess. See Al Gore in 2000, Samuel Tilden in 1876.\n\nsarah: But on this question of actually changing the election date. How much power does Trump have to do that?\n\nclare.malone: He does not have the power to change the date of the election.\n\njulia_azari: None. It\u2019s up to Congress, and elections are administered by the states.\n\nclare.malone: Here\u2019s my question, though: What happens if Trump refuses to leave the White House on Jan. 20, and there are no official election results at that point?\n\nLike, in that dire scenario (Trump not leaving, no clear winner) does House Speaker Nancy Pelosi become president and someone has to haul him out of the building?\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: If for some reason the Electoral College hasn\u2019t acted or the electoral votes haven\u2019t been certified by Congress, Trump\u2019s term ends on Jan. 20, according to the 20th Amendment. So there\u2019d be an acting president, who would be the Speaker of the House per the order set out by the Presidential Succession Act \u2014 assuming congressional elections occurred.\n\nBut of course, that\u2019s how it\u2019s written, not how it might go.\n\nsarah: Did someone mention \ud83e\udd41the 20th amendment\ud83e\udd41?\n\njulia_azari: I keep imagining this scenario, and I have to say, I have a hard time imagining that Trump refuses to leave office. I don\u2019t want to be complacent, but like a lot of people on Twitter, Trump seems to be comfortable tweeting out bold ideas and not as great at standing firm under political pressure.\n\nSo as I see it, there would be a couple of components needed for this to actually happen. There would be the political pressure \u2014 what are advisors, including Jared and Ivanka, telling him to do? This would help us understand if there are people who have influence over Trump who have some interest in seeing the system remain intact and legitimate.\n\nThe second thing would be the actual formal power \u2014 does the Secret Service force him out? Does the military gets involved? These are wild scenarios.\n\nI would be surprised if these institutions don\u2019t have plans for this somewhere, even if they are not publicly known.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: Not to take things down an even darker road, but in this scenario, I think it\u2019s important to consider how other institutions like the military act and how the president\u2019s supporters behave in the face of attempts to delegitimize the election results.\n\nclare.malone: Totally. I think that\u2019s where many people\u2019s minds go, too. And as a country, I think we are deeply uncomfortable (and rightly so) with the military being involved with a power transition. I mean, I personally find it incredibly chilling to consider.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: I\u2019ve seen Seven Days In May. Great movie but, uh yeah, disturbing.\n\nBut it\u2019s a sign of the times when you have Biden actually saying he thinks the military would escort Trump out of the White House if he refused to leave.\n\nsarah: Because that\u2019s the thing, as you\u2019re all saying, there are mechanisms via the 20th amendment to ensure Trump leaves office. But there\u2019s still a very real question of how some of this would actually be enforced if it came to this, right?\n\njulia_azari: Exactly. The 20th amendment was ratified to shorten the period between the presidential election in November and the inauguration, which had been in March. There was growing instability around the time it was ratified, after the 1932 election, and that\u2019s some of what it intended to deal with, but it wasn\u2019t really designed with this problem in mind.\n\nI\u2019m trying to stake out the ground that acknowledges a lot of people won\u2019t have much incentive to let Trump violate the rules in this way.\n\nclare.malone: Julia, when you say that a lot of people won\u2019t have incentive to let Trump act contrary to the rules, whom are you thinking of?\n\njulia_azari: I guess I\u2019m thinking of people who might want to run for president later.\n\nclare.malone: Republicans?\n\njulia_azari: Or make money off the Trump brand. This includes his kids, and yeah, other Republicans.\n\nclare.malone: That is, people with sway over him. Got it.\n\njulia_azari: Military leaders, too, as we saw many of them push back after the D.C. protesters incident in June.\n\nsarah: So let\u2019s talk about the other big doomsday scenario here: The results aren\u2019t considered legitimate. What are the signs that that idea is already taking root?\n\njulia_azari: That\u2019s a good way to frame that, but I\u2019m not sure there are signs that it\u2019s taking root any more than it\u2019s sorta been lurking in the conversation since 2016 \u2014 and even before.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: In the face of COVID-19, states are expanding absentee voting and, in some cases, vote-by-mail. But the president is making the case that mailed ballots are illegitimate and highly vulnerable to fraud \u2014 this is not true, of course, but by casting aspersions, he\u2019s setting up the potential for delegitimizing the results as they come in, on and after Election Day. And the after part is probably what really matters, especially if the election is close.\n\nclare.malone: Yeah, I was going to say, we\u2019ve spent the past 4 to 5 years conditioning a certain segment of the population to distrust most everything in American life, unless it comes from the president\u2019s mouth.\n\nSomeone shared this 2017 survey that found that around half of Republicans would be ok with delaying the 2020 election. Granted, the question was framed around whether people would support delaying the election to make sure people weren\u2019t voting illegally (a big claim of Trump\u2019s in 2016). But I still thought that was surprising.\n\nIt\u2019s especially striking when you get to 2020, and the questions revolve around the pandemic. I was shocked to see, for instance, the share of Republicans and Democrats who were willing to delay the election because of the pandemic (roughly 39 percent of Americans supported delaying the election, according to that survey from April).\n\nsarah: Yeah \u2026 it is mind boggling. That finding is also at least somewhat corroborated in this paper FiveThirtyEight contributor Lee Drutman published with the Voter Study Group earlier this year. In an examination of democracy in the U.S., Drutman and his coauthors found that both Republicans and Democrats were open to their preferred presidential candidate \u201crejecting the legitimacy of the election if they claim credible evidence of illegal voting or foreign interference.\u201d And in that vein, 29 percent of Republicans said it would be appropriate for Trump \u201cto refuse to leave office because he claims that he has credible evidence of illegal voting.\u201d\n\njulia_azari: One quibble with that study, though, knowing I have the utmost respect for Lee and his coauthors, is that each scenario lays out a justification for delaying the election, which I think makes it harder to say no. And I think people\u2019s willingness to tolerate this in practice is conditional on their evaluation of that evidence, the credibility of the claims and the person making the claims. (E.g., Trump, who isn\u2019t very popular.)\n\nclare.malone: Totally fair.\n\nI was pretty shocked in general to see how amenable people were to changing this very foundational thing! Even with the reasonings the survey questions provided them.\n\njulia_azari: I was, too, but I think it\u2019s not unreasonable for people to have limits on how much they trust elections if they think those elections were not administered fairly.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: And if the election is close and a state or two is in doubt, any questions about administration could become explosive. See: the 2000 election.\n\njulia_azari: Right. It\u2019s actually amazing how explosive that wasn\u2019t. But things are different now \u2014 I wonder how this plays out if we flip it around.\n\nLet\u2019s say Trump wins.\n\n(I mean, this sorta already happened in 2016. Trump won, yet he went right ahead and tried to delegitimize parts of an election he had won.)\n\nBut let\u2019s say it happens again, and he wins narrowly once again? Who questions the results? And would that be the right thing to do?\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: Yes, I wanted to bring this up! Trump said there were at least 3 million illegal votes in an election he won \u2014 conveniently undoing Clinton\u2019s popular vote margin. And then he set up a task force to investigate fraud after he took office. It found nothing.\n\njulia_azari: But there will likely be this question of \u201ccredible evidence,\u201d as they cite in that Voter Study group paper. What if Trump wins, and people were standing in hours-long lines in Black neighborhoods in Ohio?\n\nIn other words, I think there will be a question of how much skepticism about elections is reasonable, and how much is chaos?\n\nclare.malone: I think there is just going to be skepticism about this election, full stop.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: I would not discount opponents of Trump taking to the streets in that scenario. A recent simulation by a group of experts about what could happen in these sorts of scenarios did not bring me much comfort. They found that every scenario \u2014 Trump winning or losing but someone defying the result \u2014 ended in street-level violence and political gridlock.\n\nsarah: Oof. It\u2019s interesting to me, though, that the desire to delegitimize results isn\u2019t purely a Republican thing, as that Voter Study paper found. Democrats also showed signs of also being willing to reject the legitimacy of the election if it helps their preferred candidate.\n\nclare.malone: Stacey Abrams\u2019s non-concession concession speech in 2018 provided an interesting template for a potential Biden response (in case of a loss to Trump).\n\nThough I do think Biden is such a conventional politician and institutionalist that he wouldn\u2019t respond in the same way Abrams did, justified or not.\n\nsarah: Yeah and Biden obviously isn\u2019t waging a campaign of disinformation in the way that Trump is either. But perhaps one unintended effect of all this is, to Clare\u2019s point, that skepticism of the election (depending on its margin) is going to be rampant.\n\njulia_azari: Although Biden seems like \u2026 truly angry at times about the Trump presidency. It\u2019s not obvious what the institutionalist move is in that scenario, IMO.\n\nclare.malone: A good point!\n\njulia_azari: I think there\u2019s a strong possibility that skepticism is persistent and embedded in Trumpist ideology and among his followers, but not that widespread if the election is not close.\n\nclare.malone: I mean, let\u2019s go back to 2016.\n\nIf Trump had lost, we were all preparing for the launch of Trump TV, a perch from which he would rail for the impeachment of President Clinton.\n\nI can sort of see something similar happening if Trump loses (unless, of course, he\u2019s too tired to start the Trump TV experiment!)\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: OANN would love to have him.\n\njulia_azari: Again, I don\u2019t want to be complacent. I spend way too much time on politics Twitter. I spend all my time on politics Twitter.\n\nBut if Biden wins by a lot and Trump tweets a bunch, most Americans will just go on about their lives. That\u2019s sorta how 2000 played out, and that was obviously really close and subject to questions, too.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: Thing is, I can\u2019t imagine Trump conceding in a 2000-esque situation in the way Gore eventually did.\n\nclare.malone: Of course, 2000 is the election that a lot of people point to as the start of mistrust in elections as institutions. And like, the era of \u201cvoter fraud\u201d alarmism really ramped up under George W. Bush.\n\njulia_azari: But the angry minority has demonstrated that it can drive politics and policy to a great degree. So I don\u2019t want to be complacent, but I do want to be specific in my fears.\n\nclare.malone: So you could say people went on with their lives, but there were corrosive effects.\n\njulia_azari: If he loses, I sometimes imagine that people around Trump will say, \u201cPeople will say nice things about you if you do a good concession speech,\u201d and so he does. But it\u2019s not encouraging that that\u2019s what it might come to.\n\nclare.malone: Right, the integrity of democratic institutions might come down to a pep talk from \u201cJavanka?\u201d\n\nsarah: So at the outset of this chat, I asked how Trump\u2019s tweet to postpone the election was different from what he\u2019s already done to try and delegitimize November\u2019s result. And we\u2019ve also pointed out that there have been prior points in American history where voters have mistrusted election results.\n\nBut I think given the abnormal aspects of Trump\u2019s presidency, it\u2019s easy to point to historical comparisons without really probing whether the moment we\u2019re in doesn\u2019t have a historical comparison, as historian Rick Perlstein did in his tweet, telling the media he didn\u2019t want to do more interviews on how this moment might compare to 1968.\n\njulia_azari: I think Perlstein is right, but I also think that we should be precise about how abnormal politics interacts with normal politics, because that has been the story of the Trump presidency IMO.\n\nclare.malone: So, I mean, I take Rick\u2019s point in this tweet; there\u2019s this instinct that we have to comfort ourselves with history (i.e., American democracy has weathered much worse) but I do think that we sometimes dwell a bit in history without facing the new challenges that Trump presents us.\n\nWe sort of have to respect the new paradigm that\u2019s been created and understand that there are limits to what history can teach us in this particular case; i.e., Twitter, plus Trump, plus 20 years of diminishing electoral trust.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: It\u2019s interesting that people would comfort themselves with history \u2014 I take little comfort from it. We\u2019ve been on the brink before with the 1876 election, for instance.\n\njulia_azari: I think that\u2019s absolutely true. I don\u2019t see history as a comfort but rather as a guide to how much luck and skill it takes to maneuver through this stuff.\n\nI also think history is helpful because it shows what\u2019s not normal.

But we also realize that there\u2019s going to have to be an effort on our part to convince others to understand that,\u201d then-NASCAR President Mike Helton said in 2006.\n\nLike so many institutions in American life, the sport was grappling with what its place would be in a more diverse county and culture.\n\nSo when the NASCAR Cup Series\u2019 only Black driver, Bubba Wallace, called for a ban of the Confederate flag earlier this summer, saying \u201cNo one should feel uncomfortable when they come to a NASCAR race,\u201d NASCAR readily complied. It had already formally asked fans to stop bringing the flags to events in 2015 following the murders of nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., by a white supremacist. President Trump weighed in on NASCAR\u2019s decision, tweeting that its flag ban was to blame for its \u201clowest ratings EVER!\u201d (ratings are actually up following the flag ban).\n\nBut according to the Morning Consult survey from June, 44 percent of NASCAR fans agree with the president and said that fans should be allowed to bring the flag to races. Only 30 percent were fine with the ban. And at NASCAR races in June and July, Confederate flags reappeared. Not in the stands, but high above them; a group called the Sons of Confederate Veterans rented planes to fly the flag over the racetracks. The group\u2019s leader, Paul Gramling Jr., told the Columbia Daily Herald that \u201cThe Sons of Confederate Veterans is proud of the diversity of the Confederate military and our modern Southland. We believe NASCAR\u2019s slandering of our Southern heritage only further divides our nation.\u201d\n\n[Related: Confederate Statues Were Never Really About Preserving History]\n\nGramling\u2019s statement about the \u201cdiversity\u201d of the Confederate army and his use of the term \u201cmodern Southland\u201d speak volumes. Enslaved men were conscripted as soldiers and servants in the Confederate Army \u2014 they were hardly volunteers for the Southern cause \u2014 and Gramling\u2019s \u201cSouthland\u201d conjures the image of a cohesive nation, as if the Confederacy, which existed for less than five years, had not been decimated long ago.\n\nThe SCV and NASCAR\u2019s oblique tussling might seem like a fringe issue in an election year when a pandemic and an economic crisis imperil millions of lives, but their divergent visions of what the culture of the American South is \u2014 who it\u2019s for and of \u2014 embodies much about the political and cultural climate in which we find ourselves. Trump and NASCAR are in similar positions: overly reliant on a slowly shrinking, mostly white base. NASCAR is trying to expand its audience in order to stay relevant; Trump is not. The sport has realized something that the president can\u2019t seem to grasp, which is that overt shows of racism turn most Americans off.\n\nElectoral politics has played a role in normalizing on a national level the kind of neo-Confederate views that the SCV \u2014 and Trump \u2014 have condoned and promoted in recent weeks. You don\u2019t have to have grown up in the American South to have thought that the Confederate flag was inextricably tied to what the SCV calls \u201cSouthern heritage,\u201d but which really means a particular slice of Southern white culture. Going back decades, blocks of white votes in the South have been courted aggressively by non-Southerners who have played to the culture that has grown around these symbols and a particular nostalgic language about the Confederate past. During his 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan, a California governor of Illinois birth, appeared in Neshoba County, Mississippi \u2014 where Freedom Rider activists were famously murdered in 1964 \u2014 and gave a speech about \u201cstates\u2019 rights,\u201d which was read by many as euphemistic in the most loaded way possible, given the context of the place. The country had gotten comfortable with delicate work-arounds like that \u2014 the Civil War wasn\u2019t about slavery, it was about states\u2019 rights. For decades, parts of the country have tolerated a semantic category that blandly normalized a strain of white resentment at the Confederate defeat. Sometimes the language is more blunt, of course: the War of Northern Aggression, \u201cthe South will rise again\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s only halftime.\u201d\n\n[Related: Our 2020 National Polling Averages]\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, 55 percent of the country\u2019s Black population live in the South. While the region is still nearly 60 percent white, its Black and Hispanic populations are significant, and while traditionally rural, diverse, growing cities like Atlanta and Charlotte have become important business hubs. North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle region boasts the sort of academic power and national draw often associated with the Northeast Corridor\u2019s Ivy League. NASCAR\u2019s bid to diversify, geographically and otherwise, is in keeping with the modern South\u2019s changes.\n\nBut strong vestiges of the racist Confederacy have held on in the region. Mississippi removed the Confederate stars and bars from its state flag only last month, becoming the last state in the Union to do so. While the majority of Americans \u2014 52 percent \u2014 favored the removal of Confederate statues from public spaces, according to a Quinnipiac University survey from June, 52 percent of those from the South opposed removal, the only region of the country where a majority supported keeping the statues.\n\nIn the midst of a floundering campaign, Trump grasped onto Southern white culture \u2014 that particular strain of it \u2014 as a way to pull his head above water. A large base of his support does indeed lie in the South, as has been the case for all recent Republican presidential candidates; Bill Clinton won Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia in 1996, but no Democrat has since. Trump ran a race-baiting campaign in 2016, and his 2020 campaign has continued to play on long-standing tropes of racial fear, like violent \u201cliberal Democrat\u201d cities. Ironically, his use of federal law enforcement officers in Portland, Ore., is about as far from states\u2019 rights as you can get.\n\nBut Trump seems to be speaking to the SCV types and not the more \u201cmainstream\u201d white voters he actually needs to win. The SCV, for what it\u2019s worth, is more than the \u201chistorical, patriotic, and non-political organization\u201d that its website says it is. Its branches have donated to Republican politicians and it controversially purchased the Silent Sam Confederate statue that was torn down at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In other words, the group is representative of the types of (white) voters who are Trump\u2019s ride-or-dies.\n\n[Related: How Popular Is President Donald Trump?]\n\nBut Trump has misjudged \u2014 or refuses to see \u2014 that much of white America is changing how it thinks about racial issues. A Monmouth University survey from June found that 49 percent of white Americans thought police were more likely to use excessive force against a Black person, up from only 25 percent in 2016. A Morning Consult poll from May and June of this year found that 49 percent of white Americans supported the protests unfolding across the country, and 54 percent of suburbanites supported them (white people are the majority in 90 percent of America\u2019s suburban counties, according to Pew Research Center).\n\nSomeone seems to have leaned into Trump\u2019s ear and told him he needs these white suburbanites in order to have a fighting chance of winning in November. Last week, he called on \u201cThe Suburban Housewives of America\u201d \u2014 as if harkening to a membership organization from 1955 \u2014 and said that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden would \u201cdestroy\u201d their American dream by promoting affordable housing for all in the suburbs. In Trump\u2019s framing, by hoping to diversify the suburbs, Biden would destroy the \u201cSuburban Lifestyle Dream.\u201d A majority of Americans in a Pew survey conducted in 2019 said Trump had made race relations in the country worse, and while white, Black and Hispanic people still differ in their views on racial issues, it\u2019s clear that recent events have brought greater racial awareness to the forefront of white Americans\u2019 minds.\n\n[Related: A Tale Of Two Suburbs]\n\nRepublicans are increasingly worried about Trump losing a state like Ohio \u2014 once thought solidly in Trump\u2019s camp \u2014 in large part because of the president\u2019s diminishing support in suburban areas. (I wrote at length about this Ohio suburban phenomenon back in 2019.) His embrace of the racist totems of the white South \u2014 which large swaths of the white South itself eschews \u2014 could now potentially cost Trump with the Midwestern or Northeastern (whatever you want to call Pennsylvania) voters he needs to hold onto in order to win.\n\nTrump, a New York City-born pol who doesn\u2019t quite seem to \u201cget\u201d the \u2018burbs \u2014 and has never been a particularly subtle political thinker or communicator \u2014 crucially misunderstood that the muscular Southern racism the Confederate flag has long represented doesn\u2019t work in the white suburban realms of respectability anymore. That cohort \u2014 Republican and Democratic \u2014 absorbs and displays its biases more mutedly in 2020. Trump, who came to political power riding a wave of racist conspiracy theory \u2014 it was only fair to ask questions about whether the first Black president was actually American, wasn\u2019t it? \u2014 now suddenly seems ill-equipped for the political times.\n\nHe forgot that most of the country requires a modicum of plausible deniability in its dog whistles.\n\n\n\n\n\nNate Silver doesn\u2019t buy that Trump\u2019s fate is sealed, \u2018a lot could change in 100 days\u2019", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-trump-could-learn-from-nascar/", "author": ["Clare Malone"]}, {"title": "The Senate Has Always Favored Smaller States. It Just Didn\u2019t Help Republicans Until Now.", "text": "The fight for D.C. statehood is hardly new.\n\nIt\u2019s been decades since Congress first introduced legislation to make Washington, D.C., a state, and 27 years since such a bill got a full (losing) vote in the House of Representatives, but in late June, a historic step was taken: A majority in the House voted in favor of legislation that would make Washington, D.C., a state for the very first time.\n\nOf course, this bill won\u2019t be signed into law this year given the clear partisan calculus involved \u2014 making D.C. a state would almost certainly give Democrats two additional senators thanks to the District\u2019s deep blue hue. But it\u2019s important we understand why the Democrats are waging this fight now and why we might see more fights over admitting states in the years to come.\n\nThe answer boils down to unequal representation.\n\n[Related: Our 2020 National Polling Averages]\n\nOn the one hand, the Senate has always been unequal, long giving less populous states an outsized voice relative to their population. But for more than a century, this hasn\u2019t posed much of an issue: Until the 1960s, Republicans and Democrats competed for both densely and sparsely populated states at roughly the same rate\n\nBut over the last several decades, that\u2019s changed. The parties have reorganized themselves along urban-rural lines, and there is now a clear and pronounced partisan small-state bias in the Senate thanks to mostly rural, less populated states voting increasingly Republican. In fact, it\u2019s reached the point that Republicans can win a majority of Senate seats while only representing a minority of Americans.\n\nOne way to observe this growing partisan bias in the Senate is to compare the party makeup of senators elected to represent the 15 most populous states (which have collectively housed about two-thirds of population since the turn of the 20th century) to the partisan makeup of senators elected to represent the 25 least populous states (which have collectively housed roughly a sixth of the population consistently since the 1960s). As the chart below shows, the partisan makeup of the Senate was fairly even until the 1960s, when Republicans started to amass a partisan advantage in less populated states.\n\nWhat happened? Much of this follows from the post-civil rights realignment of American partisan politics, in which the Democratic Party became more consistently liberal (and thus more appealing in big, largely urban states), and the Republican Party became more consistently conservative (and thus more appealing in small, largely rural states). But that gap has also widened in recent years, especially starting in 2015, when Republicans took back a Senate majority, flipping seats in small states like West Virginia, South Dakota, Arkansas, Alaska and Montana \u2014 all states that will be tough for Democrats to regain in 2020.\n\nAnd what this has meant practically is that Republicans now hold a majority of Senate seats while only representing a minority of Americans, as you can see in the chart below.\n\nThis imbalance is significant because it poses a real obstacle to Democrats taking back a Senate majority in 2020. Take Democrats\u2019 current odds of retaking the chamber. The Cook Political Report recently said Democrats are favored to win the Senate, but considering Democrats currently lead the generic ballot for Congress by over 8 percentage points and have a similar margin nationally in the presidential race, it\u2019s remarkable that they still are only slight favorites to control the upper chamber.\n\nEven if D.C. or Puerto Rico were states (as some on the left advocate), Republicans would still have the advantage. It\u2019s true that the statehoods of D.C. and Puerto Rico would help Democrats close the small-state gap, but even if both were states and elected two Democratic senators, Republicans would still have had a two-seat majority in 2019, while only representing 48 percent of the population.\n\n[Related: The Latest Political Polls Collected By FiveThirtyEight]\n\nThe Senate has always held a contested place in America\u2019s democratic system because of its non-proportional qualities. For the first half of the 19th century, the Senate was a bulwark for the South, with an equal balance of slave and free states despite the growing Northern population advantage. And in the second half of the 19th century, Republicans attempted to \u201cstack\u201d the Senate by admitting a large number of Republican states into the union, starting with Nevada in 1864 (population of just 6,857(!) in the 1860 census), Nebraska (1867), Colorado (1876), Montana, Washington, and North and South Dakota as separate states in an 1889 omnibus, and Idaho and Wyoming in 1890.\n\nBut despite rising prairie populism spreading through the Great Plains to the Mountain West in the 1890s, Republicans\u2019 hopes for a stacked Senate didn\u2019t work out quite as planned. And thanks to the way the American two-party system developed in the 20th century, with Democrats and Republicans both containing urban liberal and rural conservative wings, the small-state bias of the Senate never became a real partisan issue \u2014 until now. It will likely remain an issue, too, as long as one party is able to win a majority in the chamber while only representing a minority of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Interval: Democrats could win 60 Senate seats | FiveThirtyEight", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-has-always-favored-smaller-states-it-just-didnt-help-republicans-until-now/", "author": ["Lee Drutman"]}, {"title": "Fear Not, Readers: We Have RSS Feeds", "text": "Fear Not, Readers: We Have RSS Feeds\n\nUpdate (March 28): Our readers have spoken, and we listened.

And as you\u2019ll hear in the podcast and read in selected excerpts below, we covered a lot of ground, including whether Hurd will vote for President Trump in November.\n\nThe transcript below has been lightly edited.\n\nOn whether Hurd will vote for Trump:\n\nGalen Druke: I want to talk about all that strategy and what the future of the party looks like. But are you going to vote for Trump this fall?\n\nWill Hurd: Like a lot of Americans, I wish I had different options on the ballot. And my plan is always to support a Republican and we\u2019re going to be making those decisions over the next 98 days.\n\nGD: So you\u2019re going to decide whether or not to vote for him over the next 98 days?\n\nWH: That is how I always approach my election. I\u2019m just like everybody else.\n\nGD: Well, you previously said that you will vote for Trump this fall. So I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re hesitant a little bit now?\n\nWH: I think that\u2019s accurate.\n\nYour polling is showing that. I\u2019m like everybody else. I don\u2019t want to vote for a Joe Biden because in the end, some of the policies, I think that a unified Democratic Party is going to pass \u2026 would be tough for the country, and things that I don\u2019t support, and haven\u2019t supported during my time in Congress. And as somebody who\u2019s represented a large, competitive district, I know something about competitive districts and what needs to be done in order to win.\n\nGD: I understand that desire not to vote for Joe Biden, but I guess more specifically on whether or not you\u2019ll vote for Trump, what could change your mind in the next 98 days that would make you view him and his presidency differently than what he\u2019s shown us so far?\n\nWH: It\u2019s a good question and who knows. I don\u2019t think a year ago we would have been thinking about a global pandemic that would have impacted the entire world and brought the world economy to a standstill. And so who knows what can happen over these next few weeks.\n\nBut in the end, what I think that I\u2019ve been trying to preach to my colleagues is that we have to change as a Republican Party. We have to start appealing to broader groups of people. And if we don\u2019t, and also if the Republican Party doesn\u2019t start looking like America, we\u2019re not going to have a Republican Party in America.\n\nGD: Everything you\u2019re saying here makes it sound like you aren\u2019t voting for Trump. Is that the case?\n\nWH: As I said, I don\u2019t like either one of my choices. And in the end, we\u2019re going to evaluate this over the next 90 days, or 96 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Will Hurd on whether he\u2019ll vote for Trump l FiveThirtyEight\n\nOn delaying the election:\n\nGD: President Trump suggested delaying the presidential election, which Congress has the power to do, your branch of government. Do you support delaying the election?\n\nWH: We are not an authoritarian government where the head of state gets to decide on a whim when an election happens. So no, this is Congress\u2019s role, as you said. It should go forward as has been established. And ultimately, look, I\u2019m of the opinion that we should be increasing the ways for people to vote, right, the more people that vote, the better off it is. And this is something that I\u2019ve been able to prove, during my time in Congress, that if you take a message to more people, you can get it to resonate with more people and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep. Will Hurd On President Trump\u2019s Suggestion To Delay The Election\n\nOn the U.S. response to COVID-19:\n\nGD: Overall, do you think the country is doing a good job combating the pandemic?\n\nWH: No. We have increasing death rates, right? We have the most number of people that are dealing with this right? I think the impact it\u2019s had on the United States of America versus other countries is still \u2026 we\u2019re dealing with one of the worst cases. We\u2019re having debates on whether you should be wearing a mask or not. Wear a mask! Right? A mask is to protect yourself but also to protect the people around you. So why are we debating that? This debate and fights around whether school should open or not \u2014 we should be talking about, \u2018how do we work together in order to exceed CDC guidelines on opening schools?\u2019, not whether or not it should happen.\n\nAnd so yeah, there are all kinds of problems. But I\u2019m always trying to work with these folks to deal with the problem as it is right now. I know in Texas, a third of the deaths of coronavirus have been in nursing homes. That\u2019s outrageous. And then also in prisons. And so if we couldn\u2019t handle this in nursing homes or in prisons, how are we going to be handling it in an educational environment where it is even more chaotic than those other places? So yeah, we have a long way to go.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep. Will Hurd On How The U.S. Is Doing On COVID-19\n\nOn the future of the Republican party:\n\nGD: Let\u2019s talk about where the Republican Party is headed. You said that the Republican Party needs to look more like America. And you know, right now, it doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re the only Black lawmaker on the Republican side in the House. Why do you think there are so few Black lawmakers in the Republican caucus in the house?\n\nWH: Everybody asked me when I first got elected, how does a Black Republican represent a 71 percent Latino district? And I say it\u2019s because you know, I work hard and I show up to communities that had never seen a Republican show up, and you do that multiple times. If you\u2019re showing up 90 days before an election, that\u2019s called pandering.\n\nYou have to be in those communities. Showing up is half the battle. And unfortunately, I think over time, professional political consultants talk about focusing on your likely \u201cx voter\u201d \u2014 whether that\u2019s a Republican primary voter or Democratic primary voter \u2014 rather than trying to grow and appeal to a broader group of people. It\u2019s hard.\n\nGD: Do you think that part of the reason has to do with Republicans actively appealing to a white identity?\n\nWH: Look, I think when you look at a person like a Steve King \u2014 and you know Steve King losing his primary is ultimately a good thing \u2014 but when you know folks that that have been elected as a Republican that say racist or misogynistic or homophobic things, that hurts all of us that identify with with being a Republican.\n\n\u2026 But what I found is that\u2019s not everybody. But yeah, over time, have those things been said? Yes. And Does that hurt? Yes. And that\u2019s why we have to speak out when those things do happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep.

The team, which opened its 2020 training camp on Tuesday, lost the 2018 AFC wild card game at home to the Los Angeles Chargers before suffering a stunning upset in the divisional round last season at the hands of the upstart Tennessee Titans.\n\nBut the way the team finished doesn\u2019t diminish what it did between those two losses. Head coach John Harbaugh said during a preseason interview last year that his team would have a revolutionary offense in its first full season with Lamar Jackson under center, and he was right.\n\nJackson was unanimously voted the league\u2019s MVP, and the team finished the regular season with the best record in the NFL, the league\u2019s top-scoring offense and the best rushing attack in NFL history. While the second-year quarterback\u2019s elevated play was key to the unit\u2019s success, the usage of its trio of tight ends and the stable of backfield mates for Jackson allowed the offense to truly flourish \u2013 especially out of heavy formations.\n\nAlthough the Ravens used a variety of personnel sets, their heavy formations garnered national attention because they contradicted the rest of the NFL. While the rest of the league was building offenses out of spread formations, Baltimore designed a system that ran nearly half of its plays from heavy formations, according to ESPN\u2019s Stats & Information Group. Out of 1,060 total offensive snaps in the regular season, Baltimore lined up 453 times (or 42.7 percent of its snaps) in heavy formations that featured different pairs of the tight ends plus Ricard. Meanwhile, the rest of the league lined up for only 27 percent of plays from heavy sets.\n\nIn 2019, Baltimore relied extensively on fullback Patrick Ricard and tight ends Mark Andrews, Nick Boyle and Hayden Hurst. The team traded Hurst to Atlanta in the offseason, but undrafted rookie Eli Wolf will compete for that third tight end spot with Charles Scarff, who spent last year on the practice squad. So it seems likely that the Ravens will continue this scheme this year.\n\nThe members of Baltimore\u2019s tight end/fullback crew were reliable blockers for Jackson and the running backs (Mark Ingram, Gus Edwards and Justice Hill) as well as viable receivers, which allowed the offense to use multiple variations of the group within the heavy sets to keep defenses guessing. In some cases, the team even had all four on the field at once.\n\nDespite having fewer total rushing yards and yards per carry with heavy personnel than with spread personnel (the Ravens rushed for 1,089 yards in heavy sets while rushing 1,560 yards in spread sets), the team\u2019s production within the heavy sets was vital to its success because it used them to extend drives and control the clock. But perhaps even more important was Baltimore\u2019s third-down conversion rate on plays from heavy packages: The unit converted 69 percent of third downs during the regular season. Converting on these downs at such a high rate led to the team averaging nearly 35 minutes of possession time.\n\nTheir production on the ground also regularly opened up the passing game by forcing defenses to use personnel packages designed for crowding the line of scrimmage. This created opportunities for the offense to capitalize on mismatches by forcing bigger and slower defenders to cover the tight ends. Jackson was able to make the most of these moments, as each of the three tight ends recorded at least 20 receptions for over 200 yards. Andrews, Boyle and Hurst averaged 12.3 yards per reception while accounting for over half of the team\u2019s 1,569 total passing yards from heavy formations. Although Ricard was mostly used as a blocker throughout the season, he also recorded a touchdown catch out of a heavy set and finished the regular season with eight total catches for 47 yards.\n\nThe depth and versatility of the group enabled them to account for nearly half of the team\u2019s total receiving yards and 15 of Jackson\u2019s 36 passing touchdowns. Andrews finished the regular season as the team\u2019s leading receiver, with 852 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns, and he led all tight ends in touchdowns.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s postseason loss to the Titans showed what can happen if teams are able to limit the team\u2019s dynamic rushing attack. After allowing the Titans to take a 14-point lead early in the second quarter, the Ravens started favoring the pass in an attempt to cut the lead. Jackson recorded a career-high 22 pass attempts in the first half, while the team had only 16 first-half rushing attempts. Jackson finished the game with 59 passing attempts, another career high.\n\nJackson and the offense went into halftime with season lows in total rushing yards and yards per carry. The unit averaged 3.81 yards per rush and gained only 61 yards on the ground. After averaging more than 37 rush attempts per game during the regular season, Baltimore finished the game with 29 carries \u2013 tying the second-lowest total of carries the team recorded in a game all season.\n\nThe Ravens\u2019 struggles were most apparent on a pair of fourth downs. Coming into the postseason, Baltimore had converted on eight of eight fourth-and-1 attempts, but it failed to convert on fourth-and-1 in the second quarter and again in the third against the Titans. The offense posted its third-lowest total of snaps and yards gained from heavy formations in the loss (17 plays for 77 yards) and also completed a season-low 37.5 percent of passes from heavy sets.\n\nWhile Baltimore\u2019s last outing was another postseason disappointment, the team\u2019s future is still bright as it heads into another season. What remains to be seen is whether the rest of the league will have caught on to the Ravens\u2019 unconventional offensive approach and devised a way to stop it, or if Jackson and his plethora of diverse weapons will carry them to another postseason.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-baltimore-ravens-used-their-tight-ends-differently/", "author": ["Andres Waters"]}, {"title": "Gun Sales Are Surging, But Background Checks Aren\u2019t Keeping Up", "text": "Gun sales were so slow earlier this year that in February, The New York Times ran a piece on how some gun manufacturers were looking to rebrand to make up for the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d\n\nBut then the pandemic hit.

On Friday, March 20 alone, 104,084 background check requests were sent to the bureau; according to a slightly different measure that includes checks run by state systems, that day saw the highest daily number of background checks on record. In fact, by that broader measure, five of the gun background check system\u2019s 10 busiest days were in March 2020. While March is usually a busy month for background checks, it was off the charts this year.\n\nBut the number of background checks didn\u2019t just go up. As you can see in the chart below, as the number of background checks sent to the FBI rose, so did the percentage that were delayed more than three business days \u2014 a critical deadline after which federal law allows dealers to legally sell a gun without a completed background check.\n\nThis is significant because it means that it may have been easier for guns to get into the hands of people who cannot legally own them.\n\nThe danger here isn\u2019t theoretical. Dylann Roof was able to buy the gun he used to kill nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 because of this loophole. Roof had a record for drug possession that meant he couldn\u2019t legally own a gun, but after the three-day period passed, the gun dealer sold him a gun anyway.\n\nTo be sure, these numbers aren\u2019t a perfect portrait of gun sales: They don\u2019t include data from 20 states that process some or all of their background checks themselves rather than through the FBI. And not every background check represents a gun sale \u2014 many checks are run when people apply for gun permits, when states check on the status of gun permit holders, or for other purposes. A single background check can also represent multiple gun sales.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nWe also don\u2019t know how many background checks from March the FBI never completed. When a background check drags on for 88 days, the bureau stops researching the potential buyer and purges the background check request from its systems to comply with federal regulations. The bureau hasn\u2019t yet released data on purged requests made in March.\n\nWe do know that the bureau never completes the overwhelming majority of background checks that take longer than three business days. For instance, 79 percent of such checks were never completed in 2019. This year, it purged over 80 percent of such checks from January and 78 percent from February.\n\nStill, Jurgen Brauer, chief economist at Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting, and other experts agree that the spike in background checks in March represented a real surge in retail gun sales. For instance, Brauer\u2019s consulting firm analysed FBI data and found that retail gun sales drove the surge in March, along with a second surge in June that was likely tied to Black Lives Matter protests. In total, the firm estimated that gun sales rose year-over-year by 85 percent in March and 145 percent in June.\n\nAnd a team of researchers at the University of California, Davis\u2019s Violence Prevention Research Program compared FBI data on gun background checks to gun violence data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, finding a nearly 8 percent increase in gun violence over expected levels from March through May 2020. This study hasn\u2019t yet been peer reviewed, but if it\u2019s accurate, that\u2019s 776 additional fatal and nonfatal injuries, not including suicides and accidents.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\nThis surge in gun sales during the pandemic has meant that an already brittle background check system is getting overloaded, causing massive delays, according to Brauer. He compared background checks to a drainage system that backs up during a big storm. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive flow of rainwater, and the systems can\u2019t handle it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FBI, however, disputed that characterization in a statement to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nHolly Morris, a spokesperson for the bureau, said the agency hasn\u2019t found a relationship between the rise in the share of delayed background checks and the increased volume of requests. \u201cThe influx in the percentage of delayed transactions and any extended processing times can be\u200b attributed to a number of variables,\u201d Morris wrote via email, adding that staffing levels for the background check system have remained the same throughout the pandemic.\n\nThere are signs that the influx in gun sales might not be slowing anytime soon. The initial spikes in gun sales in March lined up closely with events related to the pandemic, including Feb. 26, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first confirmed that the virus was spreading within the U.S. and not just being brought back by travelers, and Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration on March 13. But as the pandemic has worn on, the reasoning driving the spike in gun sales has changed, too. By the time gun sales soared even higher in June, research suggests it was no longer the coronavirus on buyers\u2019 minds but the protests over the police killing of George Floyd.\n\n[Related: The Latest Political Polls Collected By FiveThirtyEight]\n\nPhillip Levine and Robin McKnight of Wellesley College compared the FBI\u2019s state-by-state background check data with data on Google searches for the N-word to see if states with more searches for the racist slur saw a larger increase in gun sales. They found what Levine described as a \u201cmodest correlation\u201d in June, suggesting that at least some of those sales were driven by concerns over Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\u201cAs the pandemic settled down, gun sales settled down too, until it got to June,\u201d Levine said in an interview. \u201cIn the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, there was another very dramatic spike.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how gun sales in the U.S. will continue to progress, as we don\u2019t yet have data for July. The data released to FiveThirtyEight did not include June, but less-detailed data the FBI published online shows that last month the agency ran more background checks than any other month on record. And, of course, sales rose in 2016 in part over fears that Hillary Clinton would take the White House and impose new gun regulations, so with presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden ahead in the polls, another surge in gun sales may not be far behind. Not to mention that another surge in coronavirus cases could again drive a spike in sales like the one we saw in March.\n\nWhatever happens, more gun sales will likely mean more delays \u2014 potentially putting guns into the hands of people who can\u2019t legally own one.\n\n\n\n\n\nNate Silver doesn\u2019t buy that Trump\u2019s fate is sealed, \u2018a lot could change in 100 days\u2019", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-sales-are-surging-but-background-checks-arent-keeping-up/", "author": ["Joshua Eaton"]}, {"title": "Confidence Interval: Will Biden Choose Kamala Harris As His VP?", "text": "Welcome to another episode of Confidence Interval, where we make a persuasive case for a hot take \u2026 and then reveal how confident we really feel about the idea.

Some of those bids have a better chance than others; for instance, our prediction model thinks the Dallas Mavericks and Orlando Magic have effectively zero chance of missing the playoffs, no matter how the restart goes. For the other eight teams, though, there are at least some stakes in the prelude to the postseason, even if they\u2019re mostly along for the ride.\n\n[Related: Our NBA Predictions]\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s highlight the players on those eight clubs \u2014 the Brooklyn Nets, Memphis Grizzlies, New Orleans Pelicans, Phoenix Suns, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, San Antonio Spurs and Washington Wizards \u2014 who rate highest this season according to our RAPTOR player ratings and who might have the biggest impact on the pre-playoff bubble action.\n\n[Related: Who\u2019s Who In The NBA Bubble: The Teams Just Along For The Ride]\n\nDamian Lillard\n\nPG, Portland Trail Blazers\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +5.9 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 12 percent\n\nWill the restart be Dame Time? RAPTOR thinks Lillard is the best player among all the playoff hopefuls, after yet another outstanding season that saw him rank sixth among all NBA players in RAPTOR wins above replacement (WAR). Despite maintaining a usage rate north of 30 percent, Lillard also set a new career high in true shooting percentage \u2014 61.9 percent \u2014 thanks in large part to his glossy conversion rates from 2-point (51.8 percent) and 3-point (39.4 percent) range. Add in a career-best assist rate of 34.1 percent, and Dame is an incredible offensive machine, even if RAPTOR considers his defense (-2.0 points/100) subpar. Lillard has been hobbled in practice with a foot injury, but reports are that he should be ready when the real games tip off \u2014 essential news for an offensive-minded Portland team trying to gun its way into the postseason.\n\nOther Blazers to watch: C Hassan Whiteside (+3.2 RAPTOR); SG CJ McCollum (+1.4)\n\nJrue Holiday\n\nSG, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +4.8 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 45 percent\n\nWhat, were you expecting Zion Williamson here? It\u2019s true that Zion has been a revelation for the Pelicans since his debut on Jan. 22, posting a RAPTOR of +2.4 points/100 in 19 games. But the rookie might not hit the ground running in the restart; he hasn\u2019t been practicing with his team over the past few weeks because of a family emergency (though he has now cleared quarantine in the bubble). And besides, Holiday has been better according to RAPTOR anyway, with a +4.8 rating per 100. That might be surprising, but Holiday has rated better than +4.0 per 100 in each of the past three seasons, making him one of the more underappreciated two-way players in the league. Only four players this season \u2014 Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard and Holiday \u2014 have a RAPTOR offensive and defensive rating of at least +2.0 points/100. And that might actually understate the breadth of Holiday\u2019s contributions, between his mix of efficient shooting from the field, low-turnover playmaking and disruptive perimeter defense. Without question, the Pels need Williamson at his best to crash the playoff party, but they also need Holiday to keep up his quiet brand of all-around excellence in order to have a chance.\n\nOther Pelicans to watch: C Derrick Favors (+3.4 RAPTOR); PF Zion Williamson (+2.4); F Brandon Ingram (+1.1)\n\n[Related: Which NBA Contracts Were Gems This Season, And Which Were Stinkers?]\n\nPatty Mills\n\nPG, San Antonio Spurs\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +3.5 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: <1 percent\n\nMills doesn\u2019t even start for San Antonio \u2014 in 63 games, his lone appearance in the opening lineup came in late November. But he has still managed to make his presence felt this season, leading San Antonio in RAPTOR WAR (4.6) despite coming off the bench. Mills has long been an unsung player for the Spurs, dating back to their dynasty days. But at age 31, the creaky veteran still scores plenty (18.5 points/36 minutes), knocking down nearly 150 3-pointers this year (at a 38 percent clip) while almost never giving the ball away (7.6 percent turnover rate). The Spurs have little chance to make the playoffs, sitting four games out of the West\u2019s No. 8 seed with four teams ahead of them and highly paid big man LaMarcus Aldridge out for the year. But they are a markedly better team with Mills on the court, evidence of his value even in a down year for coach Gregg Popovich\u2019s crew.\n\nOther Spurs to watch: C Jakob Poeltl (+3.3 RAPTOR); SG Derrick White (+2.6); SF DeMar DeRozan (+0.1)\n\nJonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas\n\nC, Memphis Grizzlies\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +2.7 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 34 percent\n\nGuard Ja Morant has had a fine debut season (1.8 WAR) and is overwhelmingly likely to win Rookie of the Year honors, but the No. 2 pick in last year\u2019s draft was not RAPTOR\u2019s pick as the best Grizzly of 2019-20. That distinction goes to Valan\u010di\u016bnas, who\u2019s enjoying an outstanding year in his second season with Memphis, posting a career-high +2.7 RAPTOR (including a +2.2 mark on defense). Valan\u010di\u016bnas has been at his hyper-efficient best all season, ranking 12th in the league in effective field-goal percentage while averaging 14.9 points and 11.2 rebounds per game and playing tough D. According to Basketball-Reference.com, Memphis\u2019s defense allowed 109.2 points/100 with Valan\u010di\u016bnas on the court, 3.0 points/100 fewer than when he sat \u2014 a big part of why Memphis is even here. (Its defense is exactly average, while its offense has been 1 point/100 worse than the league norm.) Valan\u010di\u016bnas has looked good in warmup games, so watch for more efficient play from him if the Grizz are going to hang onto the eighth seed in the West.\n\nOther Grizzlies to watch: PG De\u2019Anthony Melton (+2.5 RAPTOR); C Gorgui Dieng (+2.3); PF Brandon Clarke (+1.2); PG Ja Morant (-0.8)\n\n[Related: Who\u2019s Who In The NBA Bubble: The Inner-Circle Contenders]\n\nJarrett Allen\n\nC, Brooklyn Nets\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +1.9 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 95 percent\n\nThe Nets have been absolutely devastated by injuries, opt-outs and COVID-19 diagnoses, costing them Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie, DeAndre Jordan, Taurean Prince and Wilson Chandler, among others. However, Brooklyn does have a couple of solid RAPTOR-rated starters left over in Allen (+1.9) and guard Caris LeVert (+1.3), plus a six-game buffer to work with over the No. 9 Washington Wizards to avoid being in danger of missing the playoffs. The 22-year-old Allen has been one of the most improved players in the NBA this season, following up a dreadful -4.3 RAPTOR in the 2018-19 regular season to post a rating 6.2 points/100 better this year. The improvement came mostly on defense, where Allen went from -2.8 to +2.5 points/100, with much better numbers in our player-tracking measures like shot defense and opposing matchup performance. Allen\u2019s offense is still negative (-0.6 points/100), but he did improve his true shooting percentage, turnover rate, offensive rebound rate and fouls drawn per 100 shots this season. In tandem with LeVert\u2019s scoring and passing skills and forward Joe Harris\u2019s shooting, Allen leaves the Nets with at least some productive options in the bubble going forward.\n\nOther Nets to watch: SG Caris LeVert (+1.3 RAPTOR); SF Joe Harris (-0.5)\n\nRicky Rubio\n\nPG, Phoenix Suns\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +1.8 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: <1 percent\n\nThe Suns have a good ensemble cast of starters, so a few of them could make a case as Phoenix\u2019s player to watch. But the team\u2019s best RAPTOR rating (+1.8) belongs to Rubio, whose arrival via free agency last summer helped the Suns improve enough to even be in this position. With Rubio on the court, the Suns score 6.7 more points/100 than when he sits, and they allow 3.3 fewer points/100 \u2014 meaning Phoenix\u2019s overall performance is about 10 points/100 better when Rubio is in the game. Why? Rubio has great chemistry with running mates Devin Booker and Kelly Oubre Jr. \u2014 two strong scorers \u2014 because he is such a good facilitator, leading the team in assist rate (39.9 percent), and his ability to draw fouls makes him an efficient fallback option on offense. Defensively, Rubio\u2019s RAPTOR has slipped some this year (from +1.2 last regular season to +0.1 points/100), but he still ranks among the league leaders in steal rate (2.3 percent), long one of the \u201chidden\u201d ways Rubio\u2019s value exceeds his reputation.\n\nOther Suns to watch: SF Mikal Bridges (+1.7 RAPTOR); SG Devin Booker (+1.0); C Deandre Ayton (+0.8); SF Kelly Oubre Jr. \u2014 if healthy (+0.6)\n\n[Related: Who\u2019s Who In The NBA Bubble: The Potential Party-Crashers]\n\nRichaun Holmes\n\nC, Sacramento Kings\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +1.5 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 9 percent\n\nHolmes isn\u2019t exactly a household name, but in the restart, he\u2019ll lead a crop of six Kings who have played at least 1,000 minutes with a positive RAPTOR this season. Holmes had spent the previous four years of his NBA career carving out a niche as a shot-blocking big man with good finishing ability around the rim, but this year he\u2019s upgraded his rating from -1.3 to +1.5 points/100 \u2014 a huge improvement. Fueling the change has been a career-best true shooting percentage (fifth-best in the league) and slightly expanded shooting range, plus improved defensive numbers in terms of both RAPTOR\u2019s on-versus-off court and player-tracking categories. Before the season was put on hold, Holmes had just returned from an injury that sidelined him from early January into March; now he should be one of the best-kept secrets of the playoff chase, even if his Kings are up against long odds to snag the No. 8 seed and extend their season.\n\nOther Kings to watch: PF Nemanja Bjelica (+0.8 RAPTOR); PG De\u2019Aaron Fox (+0.6); SG Bogdan Bogdanovic (+0.3); SG Buddy Hield (+0.2)\n\nIsaac Bonga\n\nSF, Washington Wizards\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +1.2 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 5 percent\n\nWith high-scoring guard Bradley Beal (+1.5 RAPTOR) sitting with a shoulder injury and efficient forward D\u0101vis Bert\u0101ns (+2.4) opting out of the bubble, the Wizards are running low on decently rated players for the restart. According to RAPTOR, their only above-average guys left are center Moritz Wagner (+0.6), who has logged just 707 minutes this season, and Bonga (+1.2), who may prove to be Washington\u2019s under-the-radar MVP if it manages to overcome the Nets or Magic to make the playoffs. Bonga doesn\u2019t produce big numbers; he\u2019s averaging just 4.6 points per game this season. But he is efficient with what chances he gets \u2014 producing 121.4 points per 100 possessions he personally ends \u2014 and he\u2019s been stellar when he gets corner threes, on which he\u2019s gone 11-for-23 this season. On defense, Bonga creates havoc with both steals and blocks, and the Wizards play more like a competent NBA defense with him on the court, a huge bonus for the league\u2019s worst defensive team.\n\nOther Wizards to watch: C Moritz Wagner (+0.6 RAPTOR); PG Shabazz Napier (-0.1); C Ian Mahinmi (-0.1)\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-players-to-watch-on-the-nba-teams-just-trying-to-hang-around/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "How The NHL\u2019s New Format Changed The Stanley Cup Race", "text": "On Saturday, the NHL joins the ranks of sports returning to action, with 24 teams plotting out one of the strangest paths to the Stanley Cup in hockey history.\n\nLike the NBA, the NHL season will restart in a \u201cbubble,\u201d with early games split between two \u201chub\u201d sites: Toronto (for the Eastern Conference) and Edmonton (for the West). Also like its basketball-playing cousins, hockey will have a bit of a convoluted format upon its return. Each conference\u2019s top four teams will play a round-robin tournament (under regular-season rules) for playoff seeding, while the other eight teams from each conference have a best-of-five series (under playoff rules) to determine who reaches the Round of 16.\n\n[Related: A Home Playoff Game Is A Big Advantage \u2014 Unless You Play Hockey]\n\nFrom there, though, the playoffs will look roughly the same as usual, aside from reseeding after every round and a lack of crowds or home-ice advantage \u2014 which isn\u2019t worth much in hockey anyway \u2014 for anyone except the Maple Leafs and Oilers. So with the playoffs set to begin, I wanted to see how much the Stanley Cup picture has changed since the last time players took the ice, on March 11. Using Hockey-Reference.com\u2019s Simple Rating System (SRS) for each team \u2014 and a set of logistic regressions relating SRS to win probabilities for games under rules for both the regular season and the postseason \u2014 I programmed 10,000 simulations for the rest of the season and playoffs under two scenarios: if the season had played out as planned back in March and under the current expanded format.\n\nBefore the break, the Stanley Cup favorites (according to SRS) were the Boston Bruins (13 percent), Colorado Avalanche (12 percent), Tampa Bay Lightning (11 percent), St. Louis Blues (9 percent), Philadelphia Flyers (8 percent), Washington Capitals (7 percent) and Vegas Golden Knights (6 percent). Under the new system, those seven are still the front-runners, with essentially the same odds \u2014 except Boston dropped to 12 percent and Tampa Bay moved up to 12 percent. So in that sense, the big picture of the playoffs hasn\u2019t changed much.\n\nCup favorites, then and now Most likely 2019-20 NHL champions under original* and new playoff systems Original System New System Rk Team Prob.

The Arizona Coyotes (whose Cup chances rose by 1.3 percentage points) and New York Rangers (up 0.8 points) saw their odds increase because both are reasonably good teams by SRS \u2014 each ranks in the league\u2019s top half \u2014 that had relatively long playoff odds beforehand, but now can potentially do damage in the expanded bracket. Others, such as the Montreal Canadiens and Chicago Blackhawks, watched their Cup odds go up mainly because they had next to no shot at making the playoffs under the standard system; now, the qualifying series gives each a fighting chance. And the Dallas Stars\u2019 probability went up because they are the fourth seed in the West \u2014 meaning they can avoid the qualifying round entirely and skip straight to the Round of 16, despite ranking among the league\u2019s bottom half in SRS.\n\nHow did Cup odds shift under the new playoff format?

As an example, the Pittsburgh Penguins rank eighth in SRS and possess plenty of star power \u2014 when healthy \u2014 but also finished 3 points behind the rival Flyers for the fourth-best record in the East. That means Pittsburgh must play an extra series \u2014 with just a 59 percent chance of winning it \u2014 to even make it into the Round of 16, despite having a 98 percent chance to get that far before the pause. Even though the Pens will play the Canadiens, who are tied with the Columbus Blue Jackets for the lowest SRS of any team in the restart field, Pittsburgh is a clear victim of the NHL\u2019s modified playoff system.\n\nWhose playoff odds improved under the new format?

(The good news? All three of those teams \u2014 Edmonton, Carolina and Pittsburgh \u2014 would see their Cup odds double if they do survive the qualifying round.)\n\n[Related: Apparently The Regular Season Is Irrelevant In The NHL]\n\nThis effect could also hurt Canadian teams\u2019 chances of winning the Stanley Cup for the first time since 1993. Although Montreal was among the biggest beneficiaries of the amended format, Canada\u2019s other postseason entries all saw their odds of mounting a deep playoff run drop, some significantly.

Overall, the six Canadian teams in the restart \u2014 sorry, Ottawa \u2014 are, on average, 10 percentage points less likely to make the Round of 16, 5 percentage points less likely to make the conference semifinals, 3 percentage points less likely to make the conference finals and 1 percentage point less likely to make the Cup Final now than if the season had been allowed to play out normally.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of one of the teams hurt by the change in format, though, these playoffs should be as exciting and compelling as ever. Can the defending-champion Blues keep beating the odds? Can the Bruins avenge last year\u2019s Game 7 defeat? Can the Lightning find redemption after their historic 2019 collapse? Or will one of the nonfavorites crash the party, because it\u2019s hockey? All of those storylines are why, despite months of waiting and a byzantine new playoff format (as per the NHL\u2019s typical style), the battle for the 2020 Cup still promises to be a good one.\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-nhls-new-format-changed-the-stanley-cup-race/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "Forget Norms. Our Democracy Depends On Values.", "text": "President Trump this week tweeted his intention to order the Department of Justice to investigate whether the FBI had \u201cinfiltrated\u201d the Trump campaign for political purposes. He then met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray to push the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The episode, like many before it, set off alarms among legal and political commentators. Throughout the 2016 campaign, the outsider candidate demonstrated that he would not be bound by the usual unwritten rules of the game. Political scientists, in particular, have emphasized the decline of \u201cnorms\u201d in their efforts to explain the danger posed by the Trump administration and the president\u2019s possible role in the decline of liberal democracy in the U.S.\n\nBut as with any word that has picked up heavy traction in political discussions, \u201cnorms\u201d has gotten a bit imprecise. What do we actually mean when we talk about norms? Why do such informal rules exist? And what norm violations should we really care about?\n\nWhy we need norms\n\nInformal rules tend to emerge around things that we are anxious or doubtful about. Think about social manners. We have norms against cutting in line or eating all the cake at a birthday party precisely because humans don\u2019t seem to be naturally inclined to be generous. We have to be taught to be considerate of other people and socially sanctioned into doing so.\n\nThis principle turns out to be especially applicable to presidential politics. Presidential power is vaguely defined in the Constitution, and the office is designed in a way that allows for very broad use of power. Presidents can make decisions about how to conduct foreign policy, fire executive branch officials who don\u2019t do what they want, and make policy by executive order.\n\nBecause the executive branch concentrates substantial power and influence in a single person, there are plenty of opportunities for those powers to become political weapons \u2014 if they\u2019re left unchecked. In \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt describe norms as guarding against just that, as preventing institutions from being used as \u201cpolitical weapons.\u201d We have norms about when and how presidents use their \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d for example, as well as when they should use their power to fire executive branch officials.\n\nWhy do we have informal rules (norms) about some things and formal rules (laws and regulations) about other things? One answer that Jennifer Smith and I developed in our research on the topic is that informal rules emerge when there\u2019s some agreement that a rule needs to exist but deep disagreement on the particulars. One example of this is the norm established in the country\u2019s early years that presidents would serve only two terms. There was widespread agreement that there should be limits on how long a single person could hold the presidency. But there were enough objections to any specific time span to make it difficult to put a formal rule in place. Making formal term limits would have forced a difficult conversation about exactly how long presidents should serve and about whether the limits on public accountability were worth it. Adopting an informal rule allowed the country to skip these more difficult conversations and instead just follow George Washington\u2019s lead. (Of course, it took only one violation of this informal rule \u2014 FDR\u2019s four terms \u2014 to push things over the edge for a more formal change, and that happened only after the country had grown used to the informal two-term convention.)\n\nWhen we should actually care about norm violations\n\nOK, we really need norms. But we don\u2019t need all norms equally. In the Trump era, norms are invoked with dizzying frequency, and Trump won the White House while violating all sorts of unwritten rules of campaigning. So which norms should we really try to protect?\n\nIn short, some norms are more cosmetic and about tradition and convention, and some norms are really about \u201cdemocratic values.\u201d We care about the latter.\n\nHow can we tell which is which? Three categories of norms about presidential behavior tap into crucial aspects of democracy: respecting the independence of other institutions, acknowledging that political conflict is part of the process, and keeping private profit separate from government operations.\n\nIndependence of other institutions \u2014 American politics depends on the independence of the three formal branches of the national government. So any action that erodes that independence is worth worrying about. Of course, autonomy across branches has been a tricky subject. Presidents obviously try to influence Congress and even sometimes congressional primaries. Members of Congress try to influence presidential elections. You might remember the Supreme Court getting involved in a presidential election. Because interbranch meddling has such a long history, norms may be a less powerful guideline than thinking about whether the president is trying to do something that will weaken the ability of other branches to challenge him.\n\nPolitical conflict \u2014 Let\u2019s see if we can thread this needle. First, the idea of legitimate opposition \u2014 that people can oppose and criticize the government without posing a threat to the nation \u2014 is a fundamental tenet of democracy. Trump\u2019s violation of that norm has primarily taken the form of tweets about the media and about his Democratic opponents. Journalists and opposition party members have very different roles to play here, and the implications of presidential criticism is different for each. Efforts to delegitimize criticism of the president by the media are alarming (well, I might have a bit of a vested interest here), as are threats to jail opponents. Attacks on congressional Democrats, however nasty, may violate norms of civility but don\u2019t necessarily threaten core democratic values.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s the peaceful resolution of political disagreement \u2014 not the absence of dissenting views \u2014 that\u2019s central to democracy. Corey Robin points out that sometimes norms are actually quite repressive, such as the informal rules and expectations that allowed American slavery to persist in the 19th century until the abolitionists \u201cpolarized society.\u201d It\u2019s the criminalizing of political dissent \u2014 either by attacking the opposition or denying its standing \u2014 that should be worrying.\n\nPublic and private \u2014 Since Trump won the 2016 election, there have been numerous examples of his family\u2019s private business interests becoming intertwined with government operations. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway drew criticism for advertising Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing brand during a televised interview. The real estate dealings of the Trump Organization across the globe have made critics nervous. Trump\u2019s hotels and resorts have become part of official state and government business, making it difficult to separate the president\u2019s private business interests from the work of governing. These potential conflicts of interest have thus far attracted many questions and at least one lawsuit. This kind of behavior is constrained through a mix of formal and informal rules. Thus far, it\u2019s proved difficult to rein in, despite widespread agreement that public officials should not profit from their positions.\n\nThinking more carefully and precisely about norms might actually lead us to more pessimistic conclusions about the risks to U.S. democracy. We depend a great deal on informal rules to constrain the presidency, both because of the powerful nature of the office and because it\u2019s difficult to find agreement about the kinds of formal rules that would limit presidential power. Much of the time when we\u2019re talking about norm violations, we don\u2019t so much mean a departure from standard practice as a breach in democratic principles. The ability to adopt informal rules has sometimes saved Americans from hard conversations about power and the tradeoffs that democracy requires. Those are exactly the kinds of hard conversations we might need to have now.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/forget-norms-our-democracy-depends-on-values/", "author": ["Julia Azari"]}, {"title": "How Biden\u2019s VP Pick Could Shape Perceptions Of The Ticket Overall", "text": "How Biden\u2019s VP Pick Could Shape Perceptions Of The Ticket Overall\n\nIn this week\u2019s FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew discusses the upsides and downsides of Joe Biden\u2019s choices for a running mate.

Will Hurd of Texas\u2019s 23rd Congressional District. And as you\u2019ll hear in the podcast and read in selected excerpts below, we covered a lot of ground, including whether Hurd will vote for President Trump in November.\n\nThe transcript below has been lightly edited.\n\nOn whether Hurd will vote for Trump:\n\nGalen Druke: I want to talk about all that strategy and what the future of the party looks like. But are you going to vote for Trump this fall?\n\nWill Hurd: Like a lot of Americans, I wish I had different options on the ballot. And my plan is always to support a Republican and we\u2019re going to be making those decisions over the next 98 days.\n\nGD: So you\u2019re going to decide whether or not to vote for him over the next 98 days?\n\nWH: That is how I always approach my election. I\u2019m just like everybody else.\n\nGD: Well, you previously said that you will vote for Trump this fall. So I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re hesitant a little bit now?\n\nWH: I think that\u2019s accurate.\n\nYour polling is showing that. I\u2019m like everybody else. I don\u2019t want to vote for a Joe Biden because in the end, some of the policies, I think that a unified Democratic Party is going to pass \u2026 would be tough for the country, and things that I don\u2019t support, and haven\u2019t supported during my time in Congress. And as somebody who\u2019s represented a large, competitive district, I know something about competitive districts and what needs to be done in order to win.\n\nGD: I understand that desire not to vote for Joe Biden, but I guess more specifically on whether or not you\u2019ll vote for Trump, what could change your mind in the next 98 days that would make you view him and his presidency differently than what he\u2019s shown us so far?\n\nWH: It\u2019s a good question and who knows. I don\u2019t think a year ago we would have been thinking about a global pandemic that would have impacted the entire world and brought the world economy to a standstill. And so who knows what can happen over these next few weeks.\n\nBut in the end, what I think that I\u2019ve been trying to preach to my colleagues is that we have to change as a Republican Party. We have to start appealing to broader groups of people. And if we don\u2019t, and also if the Republican Party doesn\u2019t start looking like America, we\u2019re not going to have a Republican Party in America.\n\nGD: Everything you\u2019re saying here makes it sound like you aren\u2019t voting for Trump. Is that the case?\n\nWH: As I said, I don\u2019t like either one of my choices. And in the end, we\u2019re going to evaluate this over the next 90 days, or 96 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Will Hurd on whether he\u2019ll vote for Trump l FiveThirtyEight\n\nOn delaying the election:\n\nGD: President Trump suggested delaying the presidential election, which Congress has the power to do, your branch of government. Do you support delaying the election?\n\nWH: We are not an authoritarian government where the head of state gets to decide on a whim when an election happens. So no, this is Congress\u2019s role, as you said. It should go forward as has been established. And ultimately, look, I\u2019m of the opinion that we should be increasing the ways for people to vote, right, the more people that vote, the better off it is. And this is something that I\u2019ve been able to prove, during my time in Congress, that if you take a message to more people, you can get it to resonate with more people and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep. Will Hurd On President Trump\u2019s Suggestion To Delay The Election\n\nOn the U.S. response to COVID-19:\n\nGD: Overall, do you think the country is doing a good job combating the pandemic?\n\nWH: No. We have increasing death rates, right? We have the most number of people that are dealing with this right? I think the impact it\u2019s had on the United States of America versus other countries is still \u2026 we\u2019re dealing with one of the worst cases. We\u2019re having debates on whether you should be wearing a mask or not. Wear a mask! Right? A mask is to protect yourself but also to protect the people around you. So why are we debating that? This debate and fights around whether school should open or not \u2014 we should be talking about, \u2018how do we work together in order to exceed CDC guidelines on opening schools?\u2019, not whether or not it should happen.\n\nAnd so yeah, there are all kinds of problems. But I\u2019m always trying to work with these folks to deal with the problem as it is right now. I know in Texas, a third of the deaths of coronavirus have been in nursing homes. That\u2019s outrageous. And then also in prisons. And so if we couldn\u2019t handle this in nursing homes or in prisons, how are we going to be handling it in an educational environment where it is even more chaotic than those other places? So yeah, we have a long way to go.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep. Will Hurd On How The U.S. Is Doing On COVID-19\n\nOn the future of the Republican party:\n\nGD: Let\u2019s talk about where the Republican Party is headed. You said that the Republican Party needs to look more like America. And you know, right now, it doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re the only Black lawmaker on the Republican side in the House. Why do you think there are so few Black lawmakers in the Republican caucus in the house?\n\nWH: Everybody asked me when I first got elected, how does a Black Republican represent a 71 percent Latino district? And I say it\u2019s because you know, I work hard and I show up to communities that had never seen a Republican show up, and you do that multiple times. If you\u2019re showing up 90 days before an election, that\u2019s called pandering.\n\nYou have to be in those communities. Showing up is half the battle. And unfortunately, I think over time, professional political consultants talk about focusing on your likely \u201cx voter\u201d \u2014 whether that\u2019s a Republican primary voter or Democratic primary voter \u2014 rather than trying to grow and appeal to a broader group of people. It\u2019s hard.\n\nGD: Do you think that part of the reason has to do with Republicans actively appealing to a white identity?\n\nWH: Look, I think when you look at a person like a Steve King \u2014 and you know Steve King losing his primary is ultimately a good thing \u2014 but when you know folks that that have been elected as a Republican that say racist or misogynistic or homophobic things, that hurts all of us that identify with with being a Republican.\n\n\u2026 But what I found is that\u2019s not everybody. But yeah, over time, have those things been said? Yes. And Does that hurt? Yes. And that\u2019s why we have to speak out when those things do happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. New registrations have fallen off a cliff.\n\nThe spring of a presidential election year is often a busy time for adding new voters to the rolls, and a recent report from the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit organization that aims to improve voter turnout and election security, shows registration numbers were even stronger in early 2020 than early 2016. But things changed dramatically in March, at least in the 12 places where FiveThirtyEight or CEIR were able to obtain data on new voters, a category that includes first-time voters, voters who recently moved to the state and, in some states (Texas, for example) even voters who moved between counties in the state.\n\nConsider Florida, for example, where 109,859 new voters registered in February of this year, compared to 87,351 registrants in February of 2016. But in April 2020, only 21,031 new voters registered, compared with 52,508 in 2016. The same pattern holds in 10 other states, plus Washington, D.C.: Each one registered fewer new voters in April 2020 than in April 2016, including in states where online voter registration is available.\n\nCurrently, 39 states plus Washington, D.C., offer the ability to register to vote online, and a 40th (Oklahoma) is expected to implement it this year. However, in the three places for which we have the relevant data (Florida, Maryland and Washington), online voter registration has not taken off during the pandemic \u2014 certainly not enough to make up for the lost in-person registrations. Even in Washington, where online registrations have ticked up since the beginning of the year, the pace is comparable to 2016: 2,956 people registered online in April and May 2020, similar to the 2,771 people who registered online in April and May 2016.\n\nThe fact that new voter registrations were outpacing the 2016 numbers in January and February was predictable, according to David Becker, the executive director and founder of CEIR. For one thing, population growth means that voter registration always climbs a bit, he said. The expansion of automatic voter registration makes getting on the rolls more convenient than ever in many states, too. Voters were also clearly interested in registering, Becker said.\n\n\u201cEvery piece of data we had looked at with regard to enthusiasm about engaging in this presidential election cycle indicated that we had to be prepared for the highest-turnout presidential election that almost anyone living had ever seen,\u201d Becker said, \u201cwhich makes the decline in March and especially April all the more striking.\u201d\n\nBased on the timing, it seems safe to assume that COVID-19 had something to do with the drop-off, but there\u2019s data to back that assumption up, too. In addition to how many new voters register, some states track how these new voters get their name on the books. In 2016 and in the pre-pandemic months of 2020, in-person registration at places like departments of motor vehicles made up a large plurality, or even a majority, of new registrants in the four places for which we have data on how new voters are registering. But after the pandemic caused most states to shutter many government offices, those registrations dwindled. By contrast, remote registrations (e.g., online or by mail) held relatively steady.\n\n\u201cThis is completely expected, but very concerning,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cThe coronavirus shut down most of the primary avenues through which Americans register to vote: government offices, and all the malls, theaters and public places where voter registration drives operate.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the closing of schools and public events like festivals has hindered in-person voter registration drives run by third-party organizations. \u201cWe had planned to go to 850 high schools leading up to graduation, but as schools closed, that work was clearly disrupted,\u201d said Jeanette Senecal, a senior director for the League of Women Voters who focuses on voter education.\n\nFor example, in Florida, third-party organizations registered 14,144 voters in January 2020 \u2014 a huge increase from the 1,196 they registered in January 2016. But in April 2020, they registered only 133 voters \u2014 down from 3,806 in April 2016.\n\nStates and third-party groups can still get around social distancing restrictions to get more voters on the poll books, though. Voto Latino, an organization that works to register and encourage Latino Americans to vote, has been operating digitally almost since its inception and was well prepared to continue its work during a pandemic. It uses digital campaigns to help voters register, which can even work in states like Texas, which does not have online voter registration \u2014 Voto Latino created an app that makes it easy to fill out the required form, which is then emailed to the voter to print off and mail in.\n\nDanny Turkel, the communications manager for Voto Latino, said the group has actually seen a surge in voter registration, especially since protests in response to the killing of George Floyd began. \u201cOur original goal entering 2020 was to register 500,000 voters,\u201d said Turkel. \u201cAs the numbers have come in and surged, we are now thinking that we could surpass 500,000.\u201d\n\nSo what kind of people might have registered if the coronavirus hadn\u2019t struck? Well for one thing, they\u2019re probably disproportionately young. \u201cIn any given year, far more young people register than older people, just because 18-year-olds age in [to being able to vote] and young people are more likely to move\u201d and need to register at a new address, said Kevin Morris, a quantitative researcher focusing on voting rights and elections at the Brennan Center. According to Morris\u2019s data, 57 percent of new registrants in Florida in the first four months of 2016 were under the age of 40, as were 65 percent of new registrants in Georgia. While the proportions were similar in the beginning of 2020, the total number was much lower than in the past, which means that lots of young people aren\u2019t registering as usual in at least two key 2020 swing states.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew voter registrations have nosedived during COVID-19\n\nSome of these delayed registrants may never end up registering at all. Though we don\u2019t have data for how a pandemic has affected registration in the past (since the U.S. hasn\u2019t faced a similar situation for a good century), Weiser cited another instance when voter registration dipped due to extenuating circumstances. In May of 2011, Florida passed a new bill that placed tough restrictions on third-party voter registration organizations, prompting many of them, such as the League of Women Voters, to stop operating in the state. The restrictions were suspended by a judge in May 2012 but the damage had been done; a subsequent study found that about 14 percent fewer voters registered in 2011 compared to the same period in 2007, with a notable drop following the introduction of the bill \u2014 and those registrations never completely caught up. In 2008, more than 1 million new voters registered in Florida. In 2012, fewer than 900,000 did, according to the state\u2019s voter registration data.\n\nOf course, one unusual law in Florida isn\u2019t exactly analogous to a pandemic, and it\u2019s possible that the high level of enthusiasm for this election will be enough to close the gap that COVID-19 created, especially as states begin to reopen and voters return to registration sites like the DMV. So it\u2019s difficult to know whether this drop in registrations is permanent. But it is clear that despite voters\u2019 intense interest in this election, the coronavirus has already made it harder for new voters to participate in it.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-registrations-are-way-way-down-during-the-pandemic", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers", "Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "It\u2019s Time To Give Basketball\u2019s Other GOAT Her Due", "text": "ESPN recently finished airing a 10-part documentary, \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d that gave Michael Jordan the last word on his career narrative, solidifying his place atop the NBA\u2019s GOAT hierarchy. And by the numbers, that\u2019s exactly where MJ belongs. But now it\u2019s time to give some love to another hoops GOAT, this one on the women\u2019s side: former Houston Comets guard Cynthia Cooper-Dyke. (She went by Cynthia Cooper during her playing career, but she uses her married name now.) At the same time that Jordan\u2019s last dance was playing out, Cooper-Dyke was dominating the WNBA just like Mike was the NBA \u2014 establishing a statistical record that still hasn\u2019t been surpassed.\n\nCooper-Dyke, who\u2019s now the coach of the Texas Southern women\u2019s basketball team, had been a good player in college at Southern California in the mid-1980s, averaging 17.2 points a contest in her senior season. But she was often overshadowed by teammates Cheryl Miller and Pam and Paula McGee, all of whom were named All-Americans (an honor Cooper-Dyke never received) as part of a dominating Trojans team that went 114-15, won two championships and visited another NCAA final during Cooper-Dyke\u2019s career.\n\nMiller was often regarded as the Michael Jordan of women\u2019s basketball by the time she finished her storied career, and Cooper-Dyke sometimes chafed in her shadow. \u201cThere was always this friction/competition between Cheryl and I,\u201d Cooper-Dyke said in \u201cWomen of Troy,\u201d an HBO documentary about USC\u2019s \u201980s dynasty. \u201cI think she had something to prove, and I definitely had a chip on my shoulder having to prove to her and everyone watching that, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m kind of talented too.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Cooper-Dyke\u2019s skills were evident even then, particularly when she was named to the NCAA\u2019s All-Tournament team in 1986 after averaging 19.0 points per game on 54.3 percent shooting during USC\u2019s journey to the championship game.\n\nBecause of the lack of professional opportunities for women\u2019s players at the time \u2014 the WNBA wouldn\u2019t exist for another 11 years after Cooper-Dyke left college \u2014 Cooper-Dyke had to play in Europe, bouncing between teams in Spain and Italy for a decade while producing some incredible stats along the way. In her lone season with Samoa Betera, for instance, Cooper-Dyke led the Spanish league in scoring with 45 points per game, according to her autobiography. She had unlocked a part of her game that had been lurking under the surface at USC.\n\n\u201cI was pumped,\u201d Cooper-Dyke wrote. \u201cNot only was it my first professional experience, but it was the first time I had been a go-to player. I finally had my first real opportunity to showcase my talent. I was ready to shout \u2014 \u2018Hey! Look at me. I\u2019m on the scene.\u2019\u201d\n\nCooper-Dyke would go on to lead her league in scoring eight times during her 10 years overseas, never finishing any lower than second. She also won a variety of gold medals for Team USA, including at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. By the beginning of 1997, when the was WNBA preparing a list of players for its inaugural allocation draft, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s exploits in Europe were enough put her in the initial group of 16 franchise players used to seed the league\u2019s eight teams \u2014 along with superstars such as Lisa Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes, Teresa Weatherspoon and Rebecca Lobo.\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown\n\nStill, Cooper-Dyke was somewhat unknown to American fans on the eve of the WNBA\u2019s debut. \u201cNobody was following what was going on overseas, but she was dominating the Italian league, [she was] the leading scorer, won championships,\u201d Hall of Famer Ticha Penicheiro said in a WNBA feature on Cooper-Dyke. \u201cPeople just didn\u2019t know about her.\u201d\n\nThat changed in a hurry during the WNBA\u2019s initial season. Cooper-Dyke was instantly and obviously the new league\u2019s best player: She won MVP honors while leading the Comets to the league\u2019s best record and the first-ever WNBA championship. She also swept the league\u2019s advanced-stats leaderboard, finishing No. 1 in player efficiency rating, win shares and win shares per 40 minutes. According to a composite mix of PER and WS/40 designed to mimic our RAPTOR NBA ratings, Cooper-Dyke added 10.6 points per 100 possessions more than average to Houston\u2019s league-leading +8.7 net rating, carrying the Comets while Swoopes missed the majority of the season after giving birth to her son.\n\nCooper-Dyke did it all at 34, too \u2014 well past the prime age for basketball players. It makes you wonder what feats she might have accomplished if the WNBA had existed just a decade earlier. And as great as Cooper-Dyke was in the WNBA\u2019s first season, she was even better in Year 2. In 1998, she once again:\n\nWith apologies to recent accomplishments of Elena Delle Donne and Nneka Ogwumike, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s 1998 may have been the best single-season performance in WNBA history. In terms of composite rating, it trails only Lauren Jackson\u2019s 2006 among seasons of at least 375 minutes:\n\nCooper-Dyke\u2019s early WNBA seasons are among the best ever Best single-season composite ratings \u2014 based on a mix of player efficiency rating (PER) and win shares per 40 minutes \u2014 for WNBA players who played at least 375 minutes that season, 1997-2019 Player Season Age Team PER WS/40 Composite Rating Lauren Jackson 2006 25 SEA 34.7 .416 +11.5 Cynthia Cooper 1998 35 HOU 31.1 .382 +10.7 Cynthia Cooper 1997 34 HOU 32.2 .385 +10.6 Sheryl Swoopes 2000 29 HOU 32.0 .361 +10.5 Lauren Jackson 2007 26 SEA 35.0 .373 +10.4 Nneka Ogwumike 2016 25 LAS 31.3 .370 +10.3 Sylvia Fowles 2017 31 MIN 30.8 .350 +10.0 Elena Delle Donne 2019 29 WAS 31.8 .343 +9.9 Elena Delle Donne 2015 25 CHI 32.8 .346 +9.4 Lauren Jackson 2003 22 SEA 32.1 .333 +9.2 Cynthia Cooper 1999 36 HOU 29.5 .335 +9.2 Yolanda Griffith 1999 29 SAC 31.9 .330 +9.1 Lauren Jackson 2010 29 SEA 27.9 .333 +8.8 Tamika Catchings 2007 27 IND 29.4 .325 +8.6 Nneka Ogwumike 2017 26 LAS 28.1 .321 +8.5 Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nJackson didn\u2019t play as much as Cooper-Dyke did, and Jackson\u2019s team didn\u2019t have nearly as much success in 2006 as Houston did in 1998. Cooper-Dyke\u2019s performance came while logging 35 minutes per game for a team that still holds the record for highest single-season winning percentage (.900) in league history. That season, Cooper-Dyke had as thorough a stranglehold on the WNBA as MJ ever had on the NBA in any of his seasons. (And again, she did it at the ripe old age of 35!)\n\nIn 1999, Cooper-Dyke was still dominant, leading the league in win shares (overall and per 40) and composite rating \u2014 although Sacramento\u2019s Yolanda Griffith wrested away the PER crown and MVP honors. The Comets won their third consecutive WNBA title, however, with Cooper-Dyke once again earning Finals MVP honors. It continued a Jordanesque stretch that helped solidify Cooper-Dyke\u2019s place in history as the WNBA\u2019s GOAT.\n\nAnd then, in 2000, the Comets had the most impressive run in the history of women\u2019s pro basketball.\n\nAt age 37, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s individual stats were beginning to decline. She ranked third on the team in composite rating (+6.3) behind Swoopes (+10.5) \u2014 who had fully come into her own as a dominating superstar, winning MVP honors \u2014 and Tina Thompson (+6.5). But the 2000 Comets were the best version of their dynasty teams. After a 27-5 regular season, Houston blazed through the playoffs without losing a single game, as Cooper-Dyke won Finals MVP for a fourth consecutive season with 22.5 points and 6 assists per game against the New York Liberty.\n\nWe can measure Houston\u2019s rise from a new team to a legendary four-time WNBA champion using Elo ratings, a FiveThirtyEight staple. Before each game, Elo assigns each team a rating that essentially represents their current strength; those ratings (after incorporating home-court advantage and other factors) can be turned into win probabilities for both teams. After the game, the ratings are then adjusted based on the result, with the winner gaining Elo points in proportion to how unexpected the victory was. This spring, my colleague Jay Boice created Elo ratings for the WNBA, which follow the same general framework as our other Elo ratings from the NBA and other sports.\n\nAccording to Elo, the 2000 Houston Comets peaked with a rating of 1743 after completing their sweep of the Liberty, which, even two decades later, is still the highest rating ever achieved by a WNBA team.\n\nSadly, the Comets no longer exist, having folded in 2008. But their legacy as the GOAT lives on. The closest any recent WNBA teams have come to matching the Comets\u2019 peak Elo were the 2014 Phoenix Mercury, who topped out at 1736 after sweeping the Sky for the championship, and the 2017 Los Angeles Sparks, who reached a 1729 Elo when they took a 2-1 lead over the Minnesota Lynx in the Finals. (L.A. would go on to lose its next two games \u2014 and the series.) Delle Donne\u2019s 2019 Washington Mystics were the best offensive team in WNBA history, but in terms of Elo, their peak was just 1717, nowhere near the Comets\u2019 best mark.\n\nIn retrospect, Houston was lucky to have randomly drawn both Cooper-Dyke and Swoopes in the WNBA\u2019s initial allocation draft, and then to have taken Thompson No. 1 overall in the regular 1997 draft \u2014 it instantly gave the Comets a trio of all-time legends from the very start. With all three playing to their full potential, surrounded by solid role players like Janeth Arcain, Kim Perrot and Monica Lamb, it\u2019s no wonder that Houston blossomed into a historic dynasty.\n\nBut at the center of it all was Cooper-Dyke, who retired after that 2000 season at the top of the basketball world (before making a brief, four-game comeback in 2003). To this day, she remains the WNBA\u2019s all-time leader in PER (28.7), win shares per 40 (.335) and composite rating (+9.0), with Jackson and Delle Donne distantly tied behind her at +7.3. Statistically, Cooper-Dyke is the best ever on a per-possession basis, and it isn\u2019t particularly close:\n\nCooper-Dyke dominated each and every possession Best composite ratings \u2014 based on a mix of player efficiency rating (PER) and win shares per 40 minutes \u2014 for WNBA players with at least 2,250 career minutes played, 1997-2019 Player Games Minutes PER WS/40 Composite Rating Cynthia Cooper 124 4,363 28.7 .335 +9.0 Elena Delle Donne 190 5,900 28.7 .289 +7.3 Lauren Jackson 317 10,130 28.0 .288 +7.3 Nneka Ogwumike 250 7,309 25.8 .267 +6.4 Yolanda Griffith 311 8,956 25.4 .265 +6.3 Tamika Catchings 457 14,387 26.1 .260 +6.1 Jonquel Jones 136 3,126 25.0 .254 +6.0 Maya Moore 271 8,466 24.6 .253 +6.0 Sylvia Fowles 340 10,387 25.2 .240 +5.6 Breanna Stewart 101 3,339 25.3 .225 +5.2 Candace Parker 315 9,836 25.3 .216 +4.9 Liz Cambage 117 2,910 26.5 .207 +4.7 Brittney Griner 212 6,481 24.8 .213 +4.7 Lisa Leslie 363 11,634 24.3 .206 +4.6 Sheryl Swoopes 324 10,591 23.3 .212 +4.5 Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nCooper-Dyke is the only four-time (or even three-time) Finals MVP in league history, and she is still the only back-to-back league MVP winner. She led the greatest dynasty in WNBA history, rising from a relative unknown plying her trade in Europe to become the top player in women\u2019s hoops.\n\nIt\u2019s a great story. In fact, now that Jordan\u2019s film is in the books, and once they finish telling Tom Brady\u2019s tale, maybe Cooper-Dyke should be the subject of ESPN\u2019s next documentary about GOAT athletes.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-time-to-give-basketballs-other-goat-her-due/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "We\u2019ve Updated Our Pollster Ratings Ahead Of The 2020 General Election", "text": "The competitive phase of the 2020 presidential primaries is over \u2014 which means we\u2019ve updated FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings. These ratings cover this year\u2019s presidential primaries, the 2019 gubernatorial elections and the occasional straggler poll we only just discovered from a past election. They include polls conducted in the final 21 days before every presidential, U.S. Senate, U.S. House and gubernatorial general election (including special elections), as well as every presidential primary, since 1998. We encourage you to check out the new ratings, especially when a new poll comes out and you want to gauge its reliability.\n\nSo far, it hasn\u2019t been a great year for pollsters. The 2020 presidential primary polls had a weighted average error \u2014 i.e., the absolute difference between a poll\u2019s margin (between the top two candidates) and the actual vote share margin \u2014 of 10.2 percentage points. That\u2019s roughly tied with the 2016 presidential primaries for the biggest error in primary polling this century.\n\nBut we don\u2019t blame pollsters too much for this: They have some good excuses because the 2020 Democratic primary race changed so quickly. In the span of a week (from roughly Feb. 25 to Super Tuesday), former Vice President Joe Biden dramatically reversed his electoral fortunes, and surveys just weren\u2019t able to keep up with how fast the mood of the electorate was changing. We can see that by breaking down the error of 2020 primary polls by election date:\n\nPolls of the contests on Super Tuesday had a weighted average error of 12.8 points, with 60 percent of them conducted mostly before Biden\u2019s big South Carolina win and subsequent endorsements by onetime 2020 presidential contenders former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nSouth Carolina polls had a weighted average error of 17.2 points (!), and 75 percent of them were conducted mostly before Rep. Jim Clyburn\u2019s endorsement of Biden.\n\nPolls of all other contests \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and every post-Super Tuesday state \u2014 had a weighted average error of 7.1 points, which is quite good by historical standards for primary polls.\n\nOne week torpedoed the 2020 primary polls Weighted average error of polls in the final 21 days* before each contest, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Contest Error Iowa 5.3 New Hampshire 4.9 Nevada 8.8 South Carolina 17.2 Super Tuesday 12.8 March 10 9.7 March 17 6.6 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular election date. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *Excluding New Hampshire primary polls taken before the Iowa caucuses, other states\u2019 primary polls taken before the New Hampshire primary, and primary polls whose leader or runner-up dropped out before that primary was held.\n\nIn addition, some pollsters fared better in the 2020 primaries than others. We\u2019d encourage you not to read too much into a pollster\u2019s performance in the 2020 primaries, as it typically takes a larger sample size to ascertain a pollster\u2019s true accuracy. But if there was a \u201cwinner\u201d for the 2020 primaries, it was Monmouth University, whose average error of 7.5 points was the lowest among firms that released five or more primary polls. Probably not by coincidence, Monmouth also has the highest FiveThirtyEight pollster rating overall \u2014 a sterling A+.\n\nIn general, pollsters that use the time-honored methodology of interviewing respondents live over the phone are more reliable than those that use alternative platforms like the internet, and that was mostly true in the 2020 primaries too. Suffolk University, another live-caller pollster, also performed pretty well (an average error of 8.0), although Marist College had an off year (13.3). Among online pollsters, YouGov \u2014 whose online methodology is more proven than most \u2014 excelled with a 7.6-point error, almost matching Monmouth\u2019s accuracy. The pollster with the highest average error (at least among those with five or more polls to analyze) was Change Research, at 16.1 points.\n\nThe best and worst pollsters of the 2020 primaries Average error of polls in the final 21 days* before 2020 presidential primaries and caucuses, for pollsters that conducted at least five polls, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Pollster Methodology No. of Polls Average Error Monmouth University Live 7 7.5 YouGov Online 9 7.6 Suffolk University Live 6 8.0 Emerson College IVR/Online/Text 13 8.5 AtlasIntel Online 8 8.8 Data for Progress Online/Text 29 9.3 Point Blank Political Online/Text 6 10.7 Swayable Online 22 12.0 Marist College Live 6 13.3 University of Massachusetts Lowell Online 6 14.0 Change Research Online 7 16.1 *Excluding New Hampshire primary polls taken before the Iowa caucuses, other states\u2019 primary polls taken before the New Hampshire primary, and primary polls whose leader or runner-up dropped out before that primary was held.\n\nFinally, as is our custom when updating the pollster ratings, let\u2019s take a look at the accuracy of polls as a whole through three different lenses \u2014 error, \u201ccalling\u201d elections correctly and statistical bias \u2014 each with an accompanying heat map.\n\nThe first lens is polling error \u2014 a.k.a. the same metric we\u2019ve been using so far in this article. Here\u2019s the weighted average error of polls for each election cycle since 1998, broken down by office. We already mentioned how polls of the 2020 primaries were not all that accurate historically speaking. But the limited polls we have for governor and U.S. House races this cycle have been pretty accurate so far. They had weighted average errors of 4.9 and 6.0, respectively, which is perfectly normal for these types of elections, although the sample size is still quite small.\n\n2020 primary polls misfired, but the polls are still all right Weighted average error of polls in the final 21 days before elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database President Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 8.2 7.5 7.1 7.7 1999-2000 4.8 6.1 4.4 4.4 7.7 5.6 2001-02 5.2 4.8 5.5 5.2 2003-04 4.8 5.0 5.5 3.2 6.9 4.6 2005-06 5.0 4.2 6.2 5.2 2007-08 4.2 4.7 5.7 3.5 7.6 5.4 2009-10 4.8 4.8 6.7 5.7 2011-12 4.9 4.7 5.3 3.7 9.0 5.3 2013-14 4.6 5.4 6.7 5.4 2015-16 5.4 4.9 5.8 4.9 10.3 6.8 2017-18 5.1 4.3 5.0 4.9 2019-20* 4.9 TBD 6.0 TBD 10.2 TBD All years 5.3 5.2 6.1 4.0 9.3 6.0 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential general elections to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nQuantifying polling error is arguably the best way to think about the accuracy of polls, but there are other lenses too. But say all you care about is whether polls \u201ccalled\u201d the election correctly \u2014 i.e., how often the candidate who led a poll ended up winning the election. We\u2019ve got a heat map for that too (although this isn\u2019t our preferred method, as it\u2019s a bit simplistic). Overall, since 1998, polls have picked the winner 79 percent of the time. And by this measure, the accuracy of 2020 primary polls clocked in at exactly average.\n\nPolls pick the winner 79 percent of the time Weighted average share of polls that correctly identified the winner in the final 21 days before elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database President Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 86% 87% 49% 76% 1999-2000 81 84 54 67% 95% 76 2001-02 87 82 73 81 2003-04 76 82 64 79 94 79 2005-06 89 92 73 84 2007-08 95 95 84 94 79 88 2009-10 85 85 77 82 2011-12 91 87 70 82 62 77 2013-14 80 75 76 77 2015-16 68 78 58 71 86 77 2017-18 74 74 79 75 2019-20* 88 TBD 41 TBD 79 TBD All years 82 83 72 79 81 79 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential general elections to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nFrankly, though, this isn\u2019t a great way to think about polls. Say a poll had the Republican ahead by 1 point but the Democrat ended up winning the election by 1 point \u2014 that\u2019s a pretty accurate result even though the winner was incorrectly identified. On the other hand, if the Republican ended up winning by 20 points, the poll did correctly identify the winner \u2014 but the absolute error was quite large.\n\nAdditionally, polls of close elections unsurprisingly make the wrong call much more frequently than races where there is no doubt which candidate is going to win. In both the 2020 primaries and overall, polls showing a blowout (i.e., the leader led by 20 points or more) picked the correct winner almost all the time, but they were right only about half the time when they showed a lead smaller than 3 points.\n\nPolls often miss close races Share of polls that correctly identified the winner in the final 21 days before elections, by how close the poll showed the race % of Polls Picking Winner Margin 2020 Primaries All Races Since 1998 <3 pts 46% 57% 3-6 72 70 6-10 79 84 10-15 75 93 15-20 82 97 \u226520 98 99 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nThis is why, when a poll shows a close race, your takeaway shouldn\u2019t be, \u201cThis candidate leads by 1 point!\u201d but rather, \u201cThis race is a toss-up.\u201d Polls\u2019 true utility isn\u2019t in telling us who will win, but rather in roughly how close a race is \u2014 and, therefore, how confident we should be in the outcome.\n\nThe third and final lens we\u2019ll use is polls\u2019 statistical bias. Statistical bias is different from error in that it tells us in which direction the error ran \u2014 i.e., did the polls consistently under- or overrate a specific political party? Not much has changed in this final table since the last time we published it, because we exclude presidential primaries from calculations of statistical bias (since all primary candidates belong to the same party), but we think it\u2019s worth reemphasizing its findings as we enter the 2020 general election.\n\nPolling bias is small and unpredictable Weighted average statistical bias of polls in the final 21 days before general elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House President Combined 1998 R+5.6 R+4.5 R+0.8 R+3.8 1999-2000 R+0.4 R+2.7 D+1.2 R+2.4 R+1.9 2001-02 D+3.0 D+1.3 D+1.5 D+2.2 2003-04 D+1.7 D+1.1 D+2.7 D+1.1 D+1.5 2005-06 D+0.2 R+1.3 D+0.7 D+0.0 2007-08 R+0.1 D+0.4 D+1.1 D+1.0 D+0.8 2009-10 R+0.1 R+0.7 D+1.7 D+0.6 2011-12 R+1.6 R+3.1 R+2.9 R+2.5 R+2.8 2013-14 D+2.3 D+2.6 D+3.8 D+2.7 2015-16 D+3.3 D+2.7 D+4.1 D+3.3 D+3.0 2017-18 R+0.9 D+0.1 R+0.6 R+0.5 2019-20* D+2.9 TBD D+6.0 TBD TBD All years D+0.5 D+0.1 D+0.8 D+0.3 D+0.3 Bias is calculated only for elections where the top two finishers were a Republican and a Democrat. Therefore, it is not calculated for presidential primaries. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential races to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nThose findings: Over the long term, there is no meaningful partisan statistical bias in polling. All the polls in our data set combine for a weighted average statistical bias of 0.3 points toward Democrats. Individual election cycles can have more significant biases \u2014 and, importantly, it usually runs in the same direction for every office \u2014 but there is no pattern from year to year. In other words, just because polls overestimated Democrats in 2016 does not mean they will do the same in 2020. It\u2019s good to be aware of the potential for polling error heading into the election, but that error could benefit either party. In fact, we\u2019ve observed that preelection attempts to guess which way the polling error will run seem to have an uncanny knack for being wrong \u2014 which could be a coincidence or could reflect very real overcompensation.\n\nSo despite a rocky primary season, we recommend that you trust the polls in 2020. Of course, \u201ctrust the polls\u201d doesn\u2019t mean trust all the polls; that\u2019s why we have our pollster ratings. In addition to our handy letter grades, that page contains each pollster\u2019s average error, statistical bias and the share of races it called correctly, plus details on whether it adheres to methodological best practices and a lot more. You can also download our entire pollster ratings data set, including all the polls that went into the tables in this article, to investigate further on your own. (Wondering how much more accurate live-caller polls are than online ones? Or which state\u2019s polls are the most error-prone? Wonder no more.)\n\nFor a detailed methodology of the pollster ratings, check out this 2014 article; we made a few tweaks in 2016 and 2019, such as giving a \u201cslashed\u201d letter grade (e.g., \u201cA/B\u201d) to pollsters with a smaller body of work. There are no methodological changes this year, except we do have a bit of housekeeping that probably only pollsters will be interested in: Starting with our next pollster ratings update (after the 2020 elections), we will no longer give active pollsters a ratings boost for once belonging to the National Council on Public Polls (a now-defunct polling consortium whose members were committed to methodological transparency). Active pollsters will need to participate in the American Association for Public Opinion Research\u2019s Transparency Initiative or contribute to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archive to get credit in the \u201cNCPP/AAPOR/Roper\u201d column, which also determines which pollsters we consider \u201cgold standard.\u201d As always, if anyone has any questions about any aspect of the pollster ratings, you can always reach us at polls@fivethirtyeight.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Does Trump Really Want A Fight With Obama?", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weve-updated-our-pollster-ratings-ahead-of-the-2020-general-election/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "The State Of The Polls, 2019", "text": "The State Of The Polls, 2019 Polls just had one of their best election cycles, ever \u2014 but challenges abound in the industry\n\nMuch maligned for their performance in the 2016 general election \u2014 and somewhat unfairly so, since the overall accuracy of the polls was only slightly below average that year by historical standards \u2014 American election polls have been quite accurate since then.

Polls have also generally been accurate in the various special elections and off-year gubernatorial elections that have occurred since 2016, even though those are also often difficult races to poll.\n\n[Related: FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings]\n\nDoes that mean everything is looking up in the industry? Well, no. We\u2019ll introduce some complications in a moment. But I do want to re-emphasize that opening takeaway, since the media is just flatly wrong when it asserts that the polls can\u2019t be trusted. In fact, American election polls are about as accurate as they\u2019ve always been. That doesn\u2019t mean polls will always identify the right winner, especially in close elections. (As a simple rule of thumb, we\u2019ve found polls \u201ccall\u201d the right winner 80 percent of the time, meaning they fail to do so the other 20 percent of the time \u2014 although upsets are more likely to occur in some circumstances than others.) But the rate of upsets hasn\u2019t changed much over time.\n\nBefore we go any further, I want to direct you to the latest version of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings, which we\u2019ve updated for the first time since May 2018. They include all polls in the three weeks leading up to every U.S. House, U.S. Senate and gubernatorial general election since then, including special elections, plus a handful of polls from past years that were missing from previous versions of our database. You can find much more detail on the pollster ratings here, including all the polls used in the ratings calculation. Our presidential approval ratings, generic congressional ballot and impeachment trackers have also been updated to reflect these new ratings, although they make little difference to the topline numbers.\n\nNow then, for those complications: The main one is simply that response rates to traditional telephone polls continue to decline. In large part because of caller-ID and call-blocking technologies, it\u2019s simply harder than it used to be to get people to answer phone calls from people they don\u2019t know. In addition to potentially making polls less accurate, that also makes them more expensive, since a pollster has to spend more time making calls for every completed response that it gets. As a result, the overall number of polls has begun to slightly decline. There were 532 polls in our pollster ratings database, which covers polls in the 21 days before elections occur, associated with elections on Nov. 6, 2018, which is down from 558 polls for Election Day 2014 and 692 polls for Election Day 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The races we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching on Election Day 2019\n\nSo why not turn to online polls or other new technologies? Well, the problem is that in recent elections, polls that use live interviewers to call both landlines and cellphones continue to outperform other methods, such as online and automated (IVR) polls. Moreover, online and IVR polls are generally more prone toward herding \u2014 that is, making methodological choices, or picking and choosing which results they publish, in ways that make their polls match other, more traditional polls. So not only are online and automated polls somewhat less accurate than live-caller polls, but they\u2019d probably suffer a further decline in accuracy if they didn\u2019t have live polls to herd toward.\n\nStill, online polling is undoubtedly a large part of polling\u2019s future \u2014 and some online polling firms are more accurate than others. Among the most prolific online pollsters, for example, YouGov stands out for being more accurate than others such as Zogby, SurveyMonkey, and Harris Insights & Analytics. And many former IVR pollsters are now migrating to hybrid methods that combine automated phone polling with internet panels. In the 2018 elections, this produced better results in some cases (e.g., SurveyUSA) than in others (e.g., Rasmussen Reports).\n\nPolls have been quite accurate \u2014 and unbiased \u2014 in post-2016 elections\n\nEach time we update our pollster ratings, we publish a few charts that depict the overall health of the industry \u2014 so let\u2019s go ahead and run the numbers again. The first chart is the one we consider to be the most important: the average error of polls broken down by the type of election. A few quick methodological notes:\n\nBy average error, I mean the difference between the margin projected by the poll and the actual election result. For instance, if the poll shows the Democrat up by 1 percentage point and the Republican wins by 2 points, that would be a 3-point error.\n\nTo not give any one polling firm too much influence, the values in the chart are weighted based on the number of polls a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle\n\nPolls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect that they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nNote that I\u2019ve included the handful of elections that have occurred so far in 2019 with the 2017-18 election cycle, even though we\u2019ll classify them them later as part of the 2019-20 cycle instead.\n\nOK, here\u2019s the data:\n\nPost-2016 polls have been accurate by historical standards Weighted-average error of polls in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Presidential Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 8.2 7.4 6.8 7.6 1999-2000 4.9 6.1 4.4 4.4 7.6 5.5 2001-02 5.2 4.9 5.4 5.2 2003-04 6.0 5.6 5.4 3.2 7.1 4.8 2005-06 5.0 4.2 6.5 5.3 2007-08 4.1 4.7 5.7 3.6 7.4 5.4 2009-10 4.9 4.8 6.9 5.7 2011-12 4.9 4.7 5.1 3.6 8.9 5.2 2013-14 4.6 5.5 6.5 5.4 2015-16 5.4 5.0 5.5 4.8 10.1 6.7 2017-19 5.3 4.3 5.0 5.0 All years 5.4 5.3 6.1 4.0 8.7 5.8 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nAs I said, the 2017-19 cycle was one of the most accurate on record for polling. The average error of 5.0 points in polls of U.S. House elections is the second-best in our database, trailing only 1999-2000. The 4.3-point error associated with U.S. Senate elections is also the second-best, slightly trailing 2005-06. And gubernatorial polls had an average error of 5.3 points, which is about average by historical standards.\n\nCombining all different types of elections together, we find that polls from 2017 onward have been associated with an average error of 5.0 points, which is considerably better than the 6.7-point average for 2015-16, and the best in any election cycle since 2003-04.\n\nBut note that there\u2019s just not much of an overall trajectory \u2014 upward or downward \u2014 in polling accuracy. Relatively strong cycles for the polls can be followed by relatively weak ones, and vice versa.\n\nOne more key reminder now that the Iowa caucuses are only three months away: Some types of elections are associated with considerably larger polling errors than others. In particular, presidential primaries feature polling that is often volatile at best, and downright inaccurate at worst. Overall, presidential primary polls in our database mispredict the final margin between the top two candidates by an average of 8.7 points. And the error was even worse, 10.1 points, in the 2016 primary cycle. Leads of 10 points, 15 points or sometimes more are not necessarily safe in the primaries.\n\nWe can also look at polling accuracy by simply counting up how often the candidate leading in the poll wins his or her race. This isn\u2019t our preferred method, as it\u2019s a bit simplistic \u2014 if a poll had the Republican ahead by 1 point and the Democrat won by 1 point, that\u2019s a much more accurate result than if the Republican had won by 20, even though it would have incorrectly identified the winner. But across all polls in our database, the winner was \u201ccalled\u201d 79 percent of the time.\n\nPolls \u201ccall\u201d the winner right 79 percent of the time Weighted-average share of polls that correctly identified the winner in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Presidential Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 86% 86% 57% 78% 1999-2000 80 80 56 68% 95% 76 2001-2002 87 87 77 82 2003-2004 76 76 69 78 94 79 2005-2006 89 89 71 83 2007-2008 95 95 83 94 80 88 2009-2010 85 85 75 82 2011-2012 90 90 70 81 63 77 2013-2014 80 80 76 77 2015-2016 68 68 57 71 86 77 2017-2019 77 77 78 76 All years 82 82 72 79 83 79 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nIn recent elections, the winning percentage has been slightly below the long-term average \u2014 it was 76 percent in 2017-19. But this reflects the recent uptick in close elections, and that resource-constrained pollsters tend to poll these close elections more heavily.\n\nAs basic as this analysis is, it\u2019s essential to remember that polls are much more likely to misidentify the winner when they show a close race. Polls in our database that showed a lead of 3 percentage points or less identified the winner only 58 percent of the time \u2014 a bit better than random chance, but not much better. But polls showing a 3- or 6-point lead were right 72 percent of the time, and those with a 6- or 10-point lead were right 86 percent of the time. (Errors in races showing double-digit leads are quite rare in general elections, although they occur with some frequency in primaries. And errors in races where one candidate leads by 20 or more points are once-in-a-blue-moon types of events, regardless of the type of election.)\n\nPolls often misidentify the winner in a close race Share of polls that correctly identified the winner in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Leading candidate\u2019s margin Share of polls correctly identifying winner 0-3 points 58% \u2013 \u2013 3-6 points 72 \u2013 \u2013 6-10 points 86 \u2013 \u2013 10-15 points 94 \u2013 \u2013 15-20 points 98 \u2013 \u2013 \u226520 points >99 \u2013 \u2013 Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nAnother essential measure of polling accuracy is statistical bias \u2014 that is, whether the polls tend to miss in the same direction. We\u2019re particularly interested in understanding whether polls systematically favor Democrats or Republicans. Take the polls in 2016, for instance. Although they weren\u2019t that bad from an accuracy standpoint, the majority underestimated President Trump and Republicans running for Congress and governor, leading them to underestimate how well Trump would do in the Electoral College. Overall in the 2015-16 cycle, polls had a Democratic bias (meaning they overestimated Democrats and underestimated Republicans) of 3.0 percentage points. And that after a 2013-14 cycle when polls also had a Democratic bias (of 2.7 percentage points).\n\nPolling bias is not very consistent from cycle to cycle Weighted-average statistical bias of polls in final 21 days of the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House Pres.

Therefore, it is not calculated for presidential primaries. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nIn 2017-19, however, polls had essentially no partisan bias, and to the extent there was one, it was a very slight bias toward Republicans (0.3 percentage points). And that\u2019s been the long-term pattern: Whatever bias there is in one batch of election polls doesn\u2019t tend to persist from one cycle to the next. The Republican bias in the polls in 2011-12, for instance, which tended to underestimate then-President Obama\u2019s re-election margins, was followed by two cycles of Democratic bias in 2013-14 and 2015-16, as previously mentioned. There is simply not much point in trying to guess the direction of poll bias ahead of time; if anything, it often seems to go against what the conventional wisdom expects. Instead, you should always be prepared for the possibility of systematic polling errors of several percentage points in either direction.\n\nWhich pollsters have been most accurate in recent elections?\n\nAlthough it can be dangerous to put too much stock in the performance of a pollster in a single election cycle \u2014 it takes dozens of polls to reliably assess a pollster\u2019s accuracy \u2014 it\u2019s nonetheless worth briefly remarking on the recent performance of some of the more prolific ones. Below, you\u2019ll find the average error, statistical bias and a calculation we call Advanced Plus-Minus (basically, how the pollster\u2019s average error compares to other pollsters\u2019 in the same election), for pollsters with at least five polls in our database for the 2017-19 cycle. Note that negative Advanced Plus-Minus scores are good; they indicate that a firm\u2019s polls were more accurate than others in the same races.\n\nHow prolific pollsters have fared in recent elections Advanced Plus-Minus scores and other metrics for pollsters who conducted at least five surveys for the 2017-19 cycle, in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Pollster Methodology No. of Polls Avg.

In exciting news for fans of innovative polling, the list includes polls from our friends at The New York Times\u2019s Upshot, who launched an extremely successful and accurate polling collaboration with Siena College in 2016. (It also includes ABC News, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s corporate parent, which usually conducts its polls jointly with The Washington Post.)\n\nConversely, the five of the top six worst-performing pollsters \u2014 including firms such as Carroll Strategies, Dixie Strategies, and Rasmussen Reports/Pulse Opinion Research \u2014 were IVR pollsters (sometimes in conjunction with other methods), several of which had strong Republican leans in 2017-19. Some IVR pollsters did perform reasonably well in 2015-16, a cycle where most pollsters underestimated Republicans. In retrospect, though, that may have been a case of two wrongs making a right; IVR polls tend to be Republican-leaning, so they\u2019ll look good in years where Republicans beat their polls, but they\u2019ll often be among the worst polls otherwise.\n\nIndeed, aggregating the pollsters by methodology confirms that live caller polls continue to be the most accurate. Below are the aggregate scores for the three major categories of polls \u2014 live caller, online, and IVR \u2014 by our Advanced Plus-Minus metric, average error and statistical bias.\n\nLive-caller polls have been most accurate in recent elections Advanced Plus-Minus scores and other metrics for pollsters who conducted at least five surveys for the 2017-19 cycle, in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Methodology No. of Polls Avg.

Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nThe differences are clearest when looking at pollsters that exclusively used one method. Polls that exclusively used live callers (including calling cellphones) had an average error of 4.4 percentage points in the 2017-19 cycle, as compared to 5.0 points for polls exclusively conducted online or via text message, and 6.9 points for polls that exclusively used IVR. (Pure IVR polls, however, are now quite rare. Polls that used a hybrid of IVR and other methods did better, with an average error of 5.0 percentage points.)\n\nPolling firms that are members of professional polling organizations that push for transparency and other best practices also continue to outperform those that aren\u2019t. In particular, our pollster ratings give credit to firms that support the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Transparency Initiative, belong to the National Council on Public Polls (NCPP), or contribute data to the Roper Center archive. Pollsters that are part of one or more of these initiatives had an average error of 4.3 percentage points in the 2017-19 cycle, as compared to 5.4 percentage points for those that aren\u2019t.\n\nAnother way to detect herding\n\nOur pollster ratings have also long included an adjustment to account for the fact that online and automated polls tend to perform better when there are high-quality polls in the field. We\u2019ve confirmed that this still applies. For instance, polls that are conducted online or via IVR are about 0.4 percentage points more accurate based on our Advanced Plus-Minus metric when their polls are preceded by \u201cgold standard\u201d polls in the same race. (\u201cGold standard\u201d is the term we use for pollsters that are exclusively live caller with cellphones and are also AAPOR/NCPP/Roper members.) Live-caller polls do not exhibit the same pattern, however; their Advanced Plus-Minus score is unaffected by the existence of an earlier \u201cgold standard\u201d poll in the field. This is probably the result of herding; some of the lower-quality pollsters may be doing the equivalent of peeking at their more studious classmate\u2019s answers in a math test. In fact, these differences are especially strong in recent elections, suggesting that herding has become more of a problem.\n\nThere is also a second, more direct method to detect herding, which we\u2019re also now applying in our pollster ratings. Namely \u2014 as described in this story \u2014 there is a minimum distance that a poll should be from the average of previous polls based on sampling error alone. For instance, even if you knew that a candidate was ahead 48-41 in a particular race \u2014 a 7-point lead \u2014 you\u2019d miss that margin by an average of about 5 percentage points in a 600-person poll because sampling only 600 people rather than the entire population introduces sampling error. That is, because of sampling error, some polls would inevitably show a 12-point lead and some would show a 2-point lead instead of all the polls being bunched together at a 6- or 7- or 8-point lead exactly. If the polls are very tightly bunched together, this is not a good thing \u2014 you should be suspicious of herding, which can sometimes yield embarrassing outcomes where every poll gets the answer wrong\n\nOf course, there are other complications in the real world. There\u2019s no guarantee that the race will have been static since other pollsters surveyed the race; one candidate may be losing or gaining ground. And pollsters have healthy methodological disagreements from one another, so the same race may look different depending on what assumptions they make about turnout and so forth. But these should tend to increase the degree to which polls differ from each other, and not produce herding.\n\nBut our herding penalty only applies if pollsters show too little variation from the average of previous polls of the race based on sampling error alone. If a pollster is publishing all its data without being influenced by other pollsters \u2014 including its supposed outliers \u2014 it should be fairly easy to avoid this penalty over the long run.\n\nMany polls are closer to the average of previous polls than they \u201cshould\u201d be, however. Unlike the previous type of herding I described, which is concentrated among lower-quality pollsters who are essentially trying to draft off their neighbors to get better results, this tendency appears among some higher-quality pollsters as well. In some cases, we suspect, this is because, late in the race, a pollster doesn\u2019t want to deal with the media firestorm that would inevitably ensue if it published a poll that appears to be an outlier. In other cases, frankly, we suspect that pollsters rather explicitly look at the FiveThirtyEight or RealClearPolitics polling average and attempt to match it.\n\nIn any event, our formula now detects this type of herding, and it results in a lower pollster rating when we catch it. . Our pollster ratings spreadsheet now calculates each pollster\u2019s Average Distance from Polling Average, or ADPA, which is how much the pollster\u2019s average poll differs from the average of previous polls of that race. Among pollsters with at least 15 polls, the largest herding penalties are as follows:\n\nWhich pollsters show the clearest signs of herding? Pollster Herding Penalty Research Co. 1.17 Muhlenberg College 0.84 Angus Reid Global 0.82 Grove Insight 0.71 NBC News/Wall Street Journal 0.53 The list is limited to pollsters with at least 15 polls for which an average of previous polls can be computed.\n\nOther methodological changes\n\nUnless you\u2019re really into details \u2014 or you\u2019re a pollster! \u2014 you probably aren\u2019t going to care about these \u2026 but there are a few other methodological changes we\u2019ve made to our pollster ratings this year.\n\nPreviously, pollsters got a bonus if they exclusively conducted their polls via live callers with cellphones, since these have been the most accurate polls over time. But this year, if a pollster uses live-caller-with-cellphone polls in combination with other methodologies, we now give them partial credit for the live-caller bonus. Even though these hybrid polls did not have a particularly good performance in 2017-19, they\u2019ve been reasonably strong in the long run; also, we\u2019re bowing to the reality that many formerly live pollsters are increasingly incorporating online or other methods into their repertoire.\n\nIn determining whether a poll\u2019s result fell into or outside the margin of error, a calculation that\u2019s available in our spreadsheet, we now use a more sophisticated margin of error formula that accounts for the percentages of the top two candidates and not just the distance between them. The margin of error is smaller in lopsided races, e.g., when one candidate leads 70-20.\n\nOur Predictive Plus-Minus scores and pollster letter grades are based on a combination of a pollster\u2019s empirical performance (how accurate it has been in the past) and its methodological characteristics. The more polls a firm has conducted, the more the formula weights its performance rather than its methodological prior. In assigning the weights, our formula now considers how recent a particular firm\u2019s polls were. In other words, if a pollster has conducted a lot of surveys recently, its empirical accuracy will be more heavily weighted. But if most of its polling is in the distant past, its pollster rating will gradually revert toward the mean based on its methodology.\n\nFor pollsters with a relatively small sample of polling, we now show a provisional rating rather than a precise letter grade. (An \u201cA/B\u201d provisional rating means that the pollster has shown strong initial results, a \u201cB/C\u201d rating means it has average initial results, and a \u201cC/D\u201d rating means below-average initial results.) It now takes roughly 20 recent polls (or a larger number of older polls) for a pollster to get a precise pollster rating.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now! Once again, you can find an interactive version of the pollster ratings here, and a link with further detail on them here.

Good luck to pollsters on having a strong performance in the primaries.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-state-of-the-polls-2019/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "The State Of The Polls, 2016", "text": "Two years ago, in advance of the 2014 midterms and in conjunction with the release of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings, I wrote an article headlined \u201cIs The Polling Industry In Stasis Or In Crisis?\u201d It pointed out a seeming contradiction: Although there were lots of reasons to be worried about the reliability of polling \u2014 in particular, the ever-declining response rates for telephone surveys \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much evidence of a crisis in the results pollsters were obtaining. Instead, the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles had all featured fairly accurate polling.\n\nHas the reckoning come for the polls since then? The evidence is somewhat mixed. The 2014 midterm elections were not a banner year for pollsters, with most polls showing a statistical bias toward Democrats (reversing their statistical bias toward Republicans in 2012). As a result, there were a handful of major upsets by Republican candidates, along with a few near misses. Still, the error in the polls was reasonably in line with historical norms. It wasn\u2019t the disaster that pollsters have experienced in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Greece, or even in previous U.S. midterm elections, such as 1994 and 1998.\n\nPollster Ratings: We\u2019ve analyzed the historical accuracy of more than 350 polling agencies and rated them according to performance and methodology. See all of our pollster ratings \u00bb\n\nIf the 2014 midterm polls were a little better than reputed, however, the reverse might be true of the 2016 presidential primaries polls. Importantly, the polls (and even more so, the polling averages) had a good track record of calling winners, with the polling front-runner winning the vast majority of the time. Furthermore, the polls caught wind of Donald Trump\u2019s popularity among Republicans early in the cycle, even as a lot of journalists (including, uhh, yours truly) were deeply skeptical about his chances. But the margins were often pretty far off, especially in the Democratic race, with Hillary Clinton often blowing away her polling numbers in the South and Bernie Sanders often doing so elsewhere in the country. Furthermore, although there weren\u2019t many upsets, at least one of them \u2014 Sanders\u2019s win in Michigan \u2014 was historically epic.\n\nDon\u2019t take our word for it, though: We\u2019d encourage you to explore the data for yourself. We\u2019ve just released a new set of pollster ratings, based on data up through and including the Oregon presidential primary May 17. We\u2019ve also published the raw data behind these ratings: more than 7,900 polls conducted in the final three weeks before presidential primaries and caucuses and general elections for president, governor, and the U.S. Senate and House since 1998.\n\nThe methodology we use to calculate the pollster ratings is highly similar to the procedures we followed to generate our 2014 ratings, with a handful of exceptions that I describe in the footnotes.\n\nAs before, the ratings are based both on a pollster\u2019s past accuracy and on two easily measurable methodological standards:\n\nThe first standard is whether the firm participates in the American Association for Public Opinion Research Transparency Initiative, is a member of the National Council on Public Polls or contributes its data to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archive. Polling firms that do one or more of these things generally abide by industry-standard practices for disclosure, transparency and methodology and have historically had more accurate results.\n\nThe second standard is whether the firm usually conducts its polls by placing telephone calls with live interviewers and calls cellphones as well as landlines. Automated polls (\u201crobopolls\u201d), which are legally prohibited from calling cellphones, do not meet this standard even if they use hybrid or mixed-mode methodologies (for example, robocalling landlines and then supplementing with cellphone calls placed by live interviewers). It\u2019s increasingly essential to call cellphones given that about half of American households no longer have a home landline. Although internet polls show promise as a potential alternative, they do not yet have a long enough or consistent enough track record to be placed on the same pedestal as high-quality, live-interview telephone polls, based on our view of the evidence.\n\nBut enough about methodology; let\u2019s return to the question of how the polls fared in the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential primaries.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a calculation we call Simple Average Error. It measures the difference between the percentage of the vote separating the top two finishers in the election and the margin shown by the polls. For instance, if a poll had projected Trump to beat Ted Cruz by 2 percentage points in an election and Trump won by 10 points, that would count as an 8 percentage point error. Likewise, it would count as an 8-point error if Trump had been projected to beat Cruz by 2 points but lost to him by 6 instead.\n\nIn 2014, the average gubernatorial poll had an error of 4.5 percentage points as defined in this way, and the average Senate poll had an error of 5.4 percentage points. The gubernatorial polls were a bit more accurate than usual and the Senate polls a bit less, but both figures are reasonably in line with historical norms. A bigger problem is that most of these polls missed in the same direction, underestimating the Republican candidate. (We\u2019ll take that point up in a moment.)\n\nHouse polls are typically less accurate than Senate or gubernatorial polls \u2014 the further down the ballot you go, the larger the polling error tends to be \u2014 and 2014 was no exception, with the average House poll missing by 7.9 percentage points. That\u2019s not a good result by any stretch of the imagination, although that number is inflated somewhat by a single polling firm, YouGov, which ambitiously released polls of all 435 congressional districts. Most of those polls had small sample sizes of fewer than 200 respondents, and most of them were in noncompetitive districts, which can be difficult to poll. (Our Advanced Plus-Minus and Predictive Plus-Minus calculations adjust for these factors, but Simple Average Error does not.) Excluding YouGov, the average error for House polls was 6.6 percentage points, still a mediocre performance, although similar to past years such as 1998 and 2010.\n\nIf House races can be tricky to poll, presidential primaries are even harder, for some of the reasons I mention here. Turnout is relatively low, people are sometimes choosing among several similar candidates, and voters often wait until the last minute to make their decisions. So primary polling is almost always a fairly wild ride. Still, the average error in primary polls this year was a whopping 9.4 percentage points, worse than the average of 8.1 percentage points in all presidential primaries since 2000. The problems were worse on the Democratic side, with an average error of 10.6 percentage points, compared with 8.3 percentage points in the Republican race.\n\nAnd yet, the primary polls have done a pretty good job of picking winners. In 85 percent of polls this year, the leading candidate in the poll matched the winning candidate in the election. That\u2019s much better than in 2012, when the leading candidate won in the polls only 61 percent of the time.\n\nWhat gives? A lot of primaries and caucuses were lopsided this year, with strongly regional voting patterns; Clinton dominated in the South, and Trump cleaned up in the Northeast, for example. (By contrast, a lot of Republican primaries came down to the wire in 2012.) It\u2019s easier to call the winners right, of course, when an election isn\u2019t competitive. On the other hand, it can be harder for pollsters to nail down the margin in such races. A seemingly noncompetitive race can discourage turnout, either allowing the leading candidate to run up the score or, occasionally, the trailing candidate to do much better than expected because the leading candidate\u2019s voters become complacent. As a technical matter, the handling of undecided voters also matters more in noncompetitive races. In a slight change this year, our Advanced Plus-Minus and Predictive Plus-Minus ratings account for the fact that less-competitive races are associated with a larger error, on average. Still, this doesn\u2019t entirely excuse the polls.\n\nAnother useful measure of polling performance is statistical bias, which indicates whether polls consistently miss in the same direction. If over a large number of races, for example, your polling firm projects Democratic candidates to win by an average of 5 percentage points, and they win by 2 percentage points instead, that means those polls had a pro-Democratic (and anti-Republican) statistical bias of 3 percentage points. Statistical bias isn\u2019t necessarily an indication of partisan bias; some media outlets that are accused of having a pro-Republican bias in their coverage have a pro-Democratic statistical bias in their polls, and vice versa. But it has nevertheless been a problem in recent years:\n\nIn 2012, the polls had a 2 or 3 percentage point pro-Republican bias, meaning that they underrated how well President Obama would do, along with Democratic candidates in gubernatorial and congressional races. In 2014, by contrast, they had roughly a 3 percentage point pro-Democratic bias. So rather than the merely good Republican year implied by the polls, Republicans had a near-landslide in the midterms instead.\n\nThe good news is that, over the long run, the polls haven\u2019t had much of an overall bias, having underrated Republicans in some elections and Democrats in others. But the bias has shifted around somewhat unpredictably from election to election. You should be wary of claims that the polls are bound to be biased in the same direction that they were two years ago or four years ago.\n\nYou should also recognize the potential for statistical bias even (or perhaps especially) if the polls all seem to agree with one another. An uncannily strong consensus among the polls may indicate herding, which means polling firms are suppressing outlier results that appear out of line with the consensus. Good election forecasting models can account for the possibility of herding and statistical bias by assuming that the error in polls is correlated from state to state, but it raises the degree of difficulty in building a model.\n\nWhat about bias in the presidential primary polls? Those numbers aren\u2019t shown in the table above because the bias calculations we list in our pollster ratings pertain only to general elections. But we can calculate them by the same method. Indeed, statistical bias has been a problem in both party primaries this year.\n\nIn Republican primaries and caucuses, the polls generally had a pro-Trump and anti-Cruz bias. In races where Trump and Cruz were the top two finishers in some order, the bias was 5.5 percentage points in Trump\u2019s favor. The bias dissipated as the race went along, and there wasn\u2019t as much of a bias when another candidate \u2014 John Kasich or Marco Rubio \u2014 was Trump\u2019s main competitor in a state. Still, the primary results ought to raise doubts about the theory that a \u201csilent majority\u201d of Trump supporters is being overlooked by the polls. In the primaries, Trump was somewhat overrated by the polls.\n\nIn the Democratic race, the polls had a 1.8 percentage point bias toward Clinton (and against Sanders) overall. However, it varied significantly based on the demographic makeup of the state, with Clinton outperforming her polls in diverse states and Sanders beating his in whiter ones. Specifically, in states where at least 25 percent of the population is black or Hispanic, the polls had a pro-Sanders, anti-Clinton bias of 5.7 percentage points. But they had an 8.2 percentage point bias toward Clinton, and against Sanders, in states where less than 25 percent of the population is black or Hispanic.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the polls mostly identified the right winners, and some of the bias reflected the candidates\u2019 running up the score in demographically favorable terrain. (Clinton, for instance, won South Carolina by 47 percentage points instead of the 27 points projected by the polls.) Still, the results are troubling given that the Sanders and Clinton coalitions each contain hard-to-poll groups. In Clinton\u2019s case, that means black and Hispanic voters, who are usually harder for polls to reach than white voters. For Sanders, that means young and first-time voters, who are also hard to reach and who are sometimes screened out incorrectly by likely voter models. Pollsters should think carefully about their strategies for reaching these groups in the general election.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s take a look at how some of the more prolific pollsters have performed recently. The following table contains our Advanced Plus-Minus scores for polling firms that released at least 20 total polls between the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential primaries. Advanced Plus-Minus measures a poll\u2019s error as compared against others that surveyed the same race, controlling for factors such as the number of days between the poll and the election. Negative scores are good and mean the pollster performed better than other polling firms under similar conditions.\n\nThe best-performing polls recently have been those from Monmouth University and those from Marist College. Both apply \u201cgold standard\u201d methodologies, using live telephone interviews and placing calls to cellphones as well as landlines, and both participate in the AAPOR Transparency Initiative. Quinnipiac University, another \u201cgold standard\u201d pollster, has also performed fairly well of late. So has Fox News, which switched to new polling partners in 2011 and has gotten good results since then.\n\nAutomated polling firms have gotten mediocre results in recent years, especially SurveyUSA and Rasmussen Reports, although note that SurveyUSA has a long history of accurate polling and so retains a high grade overall. Public Policy Polling has gotten fairly good results, by contrast, although that may be because the pollster engages in a high degree of herding.\n\nYouGov, which fared poorly by calculations such as Simple Average Error, gets about an average rating according to Advanced Plus-Minus, which accounts for the fact that they were polling under difficult circumstances (for instance, polling obscure House races that nobody else tried to survey). Still, we\u2019re awaiting more evidence about the reliability of online polls. SurveyMonkey, which has sometimes partnered with FiveThirtyEight, released a set of polls of the Democratic and Republican primaries before Super Tuesday and got mediocre results, but it isn\u2019t really enough data to come to conclusions about long-term accuracy. Other online polling firms, such as Morning Consult and Ipsos, have focused on national polls instead of issuing state polls ahead of key primaries and general elections. In my view, the online pollsters have been too gun-shy as a group (with YouGov an important exception) to issue polls of state and local elections. These firms employ a lot of smart people, and my working assumption is that online polls are already more accurate than automated telephone polls (if not necessarily traditional telephone polls, at least not yet). But that\u2019s nothing more than an educated guess until we get more data on how they perform.\n\nListen to the latest episode of the FiveThirtyEight politics podcast.\n\nParticipation in the AAPOR Transparency Initiative, NCPP or the Roper Center archive continues to be a strong predictor of polling accuracy. Polling firms that get our AAPOR/NCPP/Roper check mark have had an Advanced Plus-Minus score of -0.4 since 2014, compared with a score of +0.8 for those that don\u2019t have it.\n\nAll told, the evidence is ambiguous enough to be consistent with almost any case you\u2019d like to make: either that the polls are about as accurate as they\u2019ve always been, which isn\u2019t to say that they\u2019re perfect, or that there are real warning signs of trouble ahead, which isn\u2019t to say the polls are useless. The answer may also depend on which polls you\u2019re looking at. As we\u2019ve found in the past, polls that employ more expensive methodologies, and abide by higher levels of disclosure and transparency, tend to be more accurate than those that don\u2019t. It may be that the best polls are roughly as accurate as ever but that the worst polls are increasingly far off the mark.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-state-of-the-polls-2016/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "How One High-Risk Community In Rural South Carolina Is Bracing For COVID-19", "text": "How One High-Risk Community In Rural South Carolina Is Bracing For COVID-19 Hardeeville has one of the country\u2019s highest ratios of vulnerable residents to ICU beds.\n\nJust as some demographic groups are more at risk than others of getting seriously ill from the new coronavirus, some parts of the country are more vulnerable to being hit hard by this pandemic. In places with more sick people, more people over 65 and fewer hospital beds per person, the health care system could easily be swamped, leaving residents who need hospitalization in even greater danger.\n\nTo find the areas at the greatest risk of being overwhelmed by a COVID-19 outbreak, we analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a collection of surveys that ask U.S. residents about their health, which allowed us to estimate what percentage of residents in a region were at risk due to their age or underlying health conditions. We then used Kaiser Health News\u2019s data on the number of hospitals and intensive care unit beds in each U.S. county to find the ratio of at-risk residents to beds.\n\nBy that measure, one of the most vulnerable regions for which we have data is the Hilton Head Island metropolitan area, where about 63 percent of adults are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and there are approximately 3,900 high-risk individuals for every ICU bed.\n\nWhile the percentage of Hilton Head residents who are at risk is on the higher end of our data set, it\u2019s still notably lower than the 70 to 80 percent we saw in several other areas we analyzed. But those regions had more health care facilities to serve those at-risk residents, while the Hilton Head area has only three hospitals and 28 ICU beds.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight\n\nTake Hardeeville, for example. It\u2019s a small city in the Hilton Head metropolitan area, and in many ways it\u2019s like any other rural area. Under normal circumstances, the city\u2019s residents would be looking forward to an Easter egg hunt, golf and pickleball tournaments, proms and graduations. But the people of Hardeeville are particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus. In the last decade, the city has seen a population boom, and many of those new residents are retirees, according to Hardeeville Mayor Harry Williams. The city\u2019s large older population \u2014 the percentage of residents who\u2019ve hit retirement age is nearly twice as high as the national share of people over 65 \u2014 may be cause for concern, as Jasper County, where Hardeeville is located, has only one hospital and four ICU beds.\n\nWhile regular hospital beds can be converted to serve critically ill patients, it\u2019s not easy to do because ICU beds require more equipment and specialized room layouts. Despite the difficulties, Coastal Carolina Hospital, the only hospital in Jasper County, has added beds for seriously ill patients by turning its observation unit into an ICU patient treatment area, according to hospital CEO Joel Taylor. Other hospitals are adding beds in temporary spaces like tents and trailers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just a lack of beds that can strain the health care system, noted David Wallace, a critical care doctor and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Shortages of space, staff, medications and other vital resources are also a concern, and health systems in rural and poorer areas will be stretched the thinnest.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be parts of the country that don\u2019t even have the staffing even if you were able to ramp up your available resources, in terms of places to put these patients,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIf we were able to create more ICU beds and more ventilators and more [personal protective equipment], who\u2019s going to be staffing those areas?\u201d\n\nCoastal Carolina Hospital is cataloguing what skills workers already have and cross-training them to work in parts of the hospital outside their normal assignments. This gives the hospital more flexibility in staffing, allowing it to do more with a limited number of employees by switching people to cover areas facing staffing shortfalls.\n\nHardeeville\u2019s mayor is also worried about how easy it would be for the area to run out of other types of vital workers, like first responders. \u201cBeing in a rural area, we have a good staff, but it\u2019s not a staff that can afford to have a whole shift wiped out because one person got sick and passed it onto the entire shift,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big concern of ours because we don\u2019t have replacement numbers if our first responders get sick.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the city got a shipment of additional masks and other protective gear for its first responders a few weeks ago, just as supplies were running low. So far, the city hasn\u2019t run out, but it also doesn\u2019t have a stockpile that would last through a big surge of cases.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there have only been 15 COVID-19 cases and one death in Jasper County, according to South Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Environmental Control. COVID-19 data should always be taken with a grain of salt, though, since tests have been so hard to come by. The closest testing site to Hardeeville is a hospital in a neighboring county, about 35 minutes away. Coastal Carolina is working on being able to test patients on site, Taylor said.\n\nThe state is encouraging residents to practice social distancing. But of course, staying at home is easier for some people than others. Williams said that in the gated communities where older residents often live, \u201cAmazon is a way of life,\u201d but that\u2019s not the case for working families.\n\n\u201cDelivery services are not as effective as, let\u2019s say, New York City,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor the working families that have to go to the grocery stores, go to Walmart for their everyday needs, those people need to go out. Those stores are open and they are taking precautions. The governor has limited the amount of people allowed in them, based on their square footage.\u201d\n\nBut even those who have to go out are doing their best to keep infection rates down, Williams said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s pitching in.\u201d\n\nBut more people may start leaving their homes soon. Shutting down businesses is having devastating effects on the economy, and the Hilton Head area is a popular vacation destination, so losing that influx of tourism dollars is an especially big blow for places like Hardeeville. South Carolina\u2019s governor announced Monday to allow public beaches and some retail stores to reopen. But experts say relaxing social distancing measures too soon and before testing is widely available might result in another influx of cases, overwhelming the health care system and leading to even more deaths.\n\nFind the full data set on GitHub to see if your area is included and how it compares with other areas.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-one-high-risk-community-in-rural-south-carolina-is-bracing-for-covid-19/", "author": ["Likhitha Butchireddygari"]}, {"title": "How Urban Or Rural Is Your State? And What Does That Mean For The 2020 Election?", "text": "How Urban Or Rural Is Your State? And What Does That Mean For The 2020 Election?\n\nThe 2016 election may not have been a realignment by historical standards, but it did bring the country\u2019s political divides more in line with its cultural divides \u2014 the biggest of which may be the growing chasm between urban and rural Americans.\n\nEssentially, it boils down to this: Cities and (especially these days) suburbs vote Democratic, and rural areas vote Republican. Some research suggests that these patterns hold up even after accounting for other important political predictors like race or gender. And there\u2019s evidence that the urban-rural divide has continued to increase since 2016. For example, San Diego has historically voted Republican, but the GOP was shut out of the 2020 mayoral election after two Democrats won the most votes in the city\u2019s March jungle primary. At the same time, Republicans widened their margins in rural areas even amid their defeat in the 2018 midterms, and parts of Appalachia that had voted Democratic for generations now vote Republican up and down the ballot, completing their conversion to the GOP under President Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, however, to measure just how urban or rural a place is (although CityLab\u2019s Congressional Density Index and The New York Times Upshot\u2019s \u201cneighborhood density\u201d are good starts). So FiveThirtyEight came up with one of its own, which has already played a role in our 2020 primary forecast\u2019s \u201cfundamentals\u201d calculations. Essentially, we calculated the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of every census tract and took the natural logarithm to create an \u201curbanization index,\u201d or a calculation of how urban or rural a given area is. And this number can be calculated (via a weighted average based on each census tract\u2019s population) for states, congressional districts, counties \u2014 or anything that is made up of census tracts. Here is a calculation for how urban or rural each of the 50 states is:\n\nHow urban or rural is your state?

Source: American Community Survey\n\nYou may have noticed a pattern in the table above. The states with the highest urbanization indices include a lot of blue states, like New York, New Jersey and California. Meanwhile, the rural end of the spectrum is populated with red states like Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota. Indeed, if we directly compare this metric with the results of the 2016 presidential election, we can quantify just how important the urban-rural divide has become in our politics.\n\nAs you can see in the chart below, 10 of the 13 most urban states voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, while 12 of the 14 most rural states voted for Trump. The exceptions: the fairly urbanized states of Florida, Arizona and Texas, which went for Trump, and the more rural states of Vermont and Maine, which cast their ballots for Clinton.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, too, that this relationship between a state\u2019s \u201curbanness\u201d and its presidential vote will get even stronger in 2020, as the correlation got noticeably tighter from 2012 to 2016 (the correlation coefficient was 0.55 in 2012 and 0.69 in 2016).\n\nSo let\u2019s indulge in a little hypothetical and take this possibility to the extreme. What if the 2020 presidential vote were based purely on our urbanization index? According to our calculations, Democrats would win such a presidential election handily \u2014 323 electoral votes to 215. And the election would produce a pretty funky-looking Electoral College map \u2014 one that looks simultaneously impossible and yet also like the logical conclusion of the way our politics has been trending. Here\u2019s what the margin of victory would look like in each state:\n\nWhat if the urban-rural divide dictated the 2020 election? The results of a hypothetical presidential election if a state\u2019s urbanization were the only factor, based on the relationship between FiveThirtyEight\u2019s urbanization index and 2016 presidential election results State Result State Result Alabama R+16.0 Montana R+30.8 Alaska R+27.3 Nebraska R+8.2 Arizona D+6.1 Nevada D+12.3 Arkansas R+20.5 New Hampshire R+11.9 California D+17.7 New Jersey D+18.3 Colorado D+4.2 New Mexico R+12.2 Connecticut D+7.6 New York D+22.5 Delaware D+2.3 North Carolina R+6.6 Florida D+8.3 North Dakota R+23.2 Georgia R+3.6 Ohio D+0.6 Hawaii D+3.3 Oklahoma R+11.6 Idaho R+16.1 Oregon R+1.5 Illinois D+10.3 Pennsylvania D+4.1 Indiana R+5.5 Rhode Island D+11.6 Iowa R+16.1 South Carolina R+9.4 Kansas R+9.3 South Dakota R+27.4 Kentucky R+13.6 Tennessee R+8.3 Louisiana R+8.6 Texas D+4.5 Maine R+23.4 Utah D+1.7 Maryland D+11.5 Vermont R+25.9 Massachusetts D+13.2 Virginia D+1.0 Michigan R+0.3 Washington D+3.8 Minnesota R+4.9 West Virginia R+22.4 Mississippi R+25.1 Wisconsin R+8.3 Missouri R+8.2 Wyoming R+33.6 Source: American Community Survey\n\nYes, some of the results are fantasies. Utah, despite being a bit more urban than your average state, is not going to vote Democratic any time soon. And if Vermont votes Republican by nearly 26 points, please pinch me.\n\nBut other results look more plausible, even if they are maybe a few election cycles away from this reality. In this scenario, the Midwest continues its embrace of the GOP, enough to make Minnesota a red state and Wisconsin go Republican by more than 8 points. Thanks to Chicago, Illinois would be the only Democratic bastion left in the region; Michigan and Ohio, though, would remain swing states.\n\nDemocrats, however, would more than make up for losses in the Midwest with wins in the Sun Belt. Florida, Arizona and Texas would become light blue states in this hypothetical. And given that these three states were decided by single digits in 2016, it\u2019s actually not that far-fetched that they could vote Democratic in 2020 in real life. That said, two other emerging Democratic targets, Georgia and North Carolina, remain red states in a world where elections break down exactly along urban-rural lines.\n\nBear in mind that this exercise was, as they say, for entertainment purposes only. The urban-rural divide will never explain everything about our politics; indeed, analysis that places too much weight on it misses the fact that many African Americans in rural areas vote Democratic, or that many Cuban Americans in urban areas like Miami vote Republican. But it does help to illustrate why so many Democrats believe the path forward for their party is through the Sun Belt.\n\nAnd indeed, early polls suggest former Vice President Joe Biden is competitive with Trump in Florida, Arizona and, to a lesser extent, Texas. In a simple average of eight Florida polls conducted since Jan. 1, Biden leads Trump 48 percent to 46 percent. And in a simple average of eight Arizona polls so far this year, Biden leads Trump 47 percent to 45 percent. But Biden still trails Trump, 48 percent to 44 percent, in a simple average of this year\u2019s Texas polls. Still, that would be remarkably close for a state that Mitt Romney carried by nearly 16 points in 2012.\n\nObviously, these numbers can change; general-election polls have yet to come into their full predictive value. But if Biden does carry one or more of these states, he could have their high rate of urbanization to thank.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Our 2020 Election Priors", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107 And The Mavs Are Pushing The Limits Of Offensive Efficiency", "text": "A few weeks ago, Chris Herring wrote about just how historically dominant the 2019-20 Milwaukee Bucks have been on defense, a fact that has gone somewhat unnoticed as Giannis Antetokounmpo and his sharpshooting friends have cruised through the league this year. But the Bucks aren\u2019t the only team having a season for the ages on one side of the ball.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks are an absolute offensive powerhouse this year. Dallas currently leads the NBA in offensive efficiency with 116.8 points per 100 possessions; that\u2019s 6.4 points of efficiency better than the league average this season, which is the 30th-best margin over average in NBA history.

Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nAny way you measure it, this Mavs attack is scoring at one of the most efficient rates ever. And a lot of the credit has rightly gone to second-year guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107, who is on the short list of this year\u2019s MVP candidates after winning Rookie of the Year honors last season. Among players with at least 895 minutes played this season, Don\u010di\u0107 ranks third on offense (behind only James Harden and Damian Lillard) in our RAPTOR metric with a rating of +7.7 \u2014 meaning we estimate that his offense has been worth a shade under 8 more points than an average player for every 100 possessions his team plays.\n\nIs that a lot? Why yes, it is. Historically speaking, there have been only 31 individual seasons (including those from Harden and Lillard) since the 1976 ABA merger in which a player logged at least 1,500 minutes and had an offensive RAPTOR better than Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s has been this year. And Don\u010di\u0107 is easily the youngest player in the sample to produce this kind of offensive season, in his age-20 season (as of Feb. 1). Nobody on the list above him did it at age 21; Chris Paul was the youngest, at age 22 back in 2007-08.\n\nAlthough Don\u010di\u0107 still has room to improve as a long-range shooter \u2014 his 3-point accuracy of 31.5 percent ranks 140th out of 147 qualified players this season \u2014 the rest of his offensive statistics have been stellar. Don\u010di\u0107 excels at creating chances for others; he\u2019s assisted on 45.6 percent of teammate baskets while in the game. He\u2019s also great at creating for himself: He has a true shooting percentage of 58.3 percent with a usage rate of 37.0 percent, numbers that are particularly impressive when you realize that only 18.2 percent of his buckets have been assisted by a teammate (the fourth-lowest rate in the league). With his tremendous ability to get to the rim, absorb contact and finish the play, Don\u010di\u0107 is generating 115.9 points per 100 possessions while also personally finishing 38.4 percent of the Mavs\u2019 possessions that he\u2019s on the court for \u2014 numbers that are in rarified territory on the usage-vs.-efficiency skill curve.\n\nSo with Don\u010di\u0107 playing 54.9 percent of Dallas\u2019s available minutes at a +7.7 RAPTOR offensive clip, we would expect a totally average team that added him to instantly outscore a typical offense by 3.4 points per 100 possessions. But as we mentioned before, the Mavericks as a team have actually been 6.4 points per 100 better than average \u2014 meaning Dallas\u2019s standout offensive season has been about more than just Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s individual excellence.\n\nAccording to Basketball-Reference.com, seven members of the 2019-20 Mavericks have played at least one-third of the team\u2019s available minutes and generated at least 115 points per 100 possessions: Don\u010di\u0107 (115.9), Dorian Finney-Smith (121.6), Tim Hardaway Jr. (116.4), Maxi Kleber (123.4), Seth Curry (124.4), Delon Wright (121.2) and Dwight Powell (133.8). (Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is is notably absent from the list; his individual offensive rating of 109.6 is the lowest of Dallas\u2019s regulars, though he is second on the team in usage rate among those playing at least a third of available minutes.) Going back to 1976, no team in modern history has ever finished a season with this many players logging such regular minutes at such high levels of efficiency.\n\nThe Mavs are overflowing with efficient players NBA teams with the most players who played at least one-third of available team minutes and had an individual offensive efficiency of at least 115 points per 100 possessions, 1976-2020 Team Year No. of Players List DAL 2020 7 Fin.-Smith, Hardaway, Don\u010di\u0107, Kleber, Curry, Wright, Powell DEN 2019 6 Joki\u0107, Morris, Millsap, Beasley, Plumlee, Hernang\u00f3mez PHO 1995 6 Majerle, Green, Barkley, Person, Ainge, Johnson CHI 1996 5 Jordan, Pippen, Kukoc, Kerr, Harper CHI 1997 5 Jordan, Pippen, Kerr, Harper, Kukoc HOU 2017 5 Harden, Anderson, Beverley, Capela, Dekker HOU 2020 5 Harden, Tucker, House, McLemore, Capela LAC 2020 5 Harrell, Leonard, Shamet, Beverley, Zubac LAL 1987 5 Johnson, Worthy, Scott, Cooper, Green LAL 1989 5 Worthy, Johnson, Green, Thompson, Cooper LAL 2020 5 James, Davis, Caldwell-Pope, Howard, McGee MIA 2020 5 Adebayo, Robinson, Butler, Jones, Olynyk OKC 2013 5 Durant, Ibaka, Sefolosha, Martin, Collison OKC 2016 5 Westbrook, Durant, Adams, Kanter, Roberson ORL 1995 5 O\u2019Neal, Hardaway, Grant, Anderson, Scott PHO 1993 5 Majerle, Barkley, Ainge, Johnson, Ceballos PHO 2009 5 Nash, O\u2019Neal, Stoudemire, Richardson, Barbosa PHO 2010 5 Stoudemire, Nash, Richardson, Frye, Dudley POR 2009 5 Roy, Blake, Fernandez, Przybilla, Batum TOR 2018 5 Lowry, Valanciunas, Poeltl, VanVleet, Wright UTA 1998 5 Malone, Hornacek, Russell, Keefe, Stockton Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nTo be sure, Don\u010di\u0107 has opened up many opportunities for his teammates to be efficient. According to Second Spectrum, there\u2019s been a potential assist on 57.3 percent of Dallas\u2019s non-Don\u010di\u0107 shots; for context, the Phoenix Suns are the team with the NBA\u2019s highest rate of potential assists per shot this season, at 57.0 percent. But his teammates still needed to convert on those chances, and they\u2019ve been doing an excellent job of it. Dallas has both seven regulars with a 3-point percentage over 35 percent and seven regulars with a 2-point field-goal percentage over 50 percent. Basically, the Mavericks almost never feature an inefficient offensive option on the floor at any given moment during a game.\n\nOf course, the abundance of 2019-20 teams on the list above shows just how much this efficiency-maximizing mentality has swept across the league, beyond just Luka and the Mavs. In the modern NBA, great offensive teams work like sophisticated machines, where all of the component pieces amplify each other\u2019s strengths. There\u2019s no place for a broken part in that apparatus, so coaches either have to find ways to help a player succeed or slot in a new player who won\u2019t be a liability. It\u2019s a testament to both Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s playmaking and the coaching of Rick Carlisle that Dallas has emerged with so many players performing so well in their roles.\n\nPerhaps an interesting comparison can be found in Dallas\u2019s previous generation of offensive juggernauts. The 2003-04 Mavs remain the greatest offensive team \u2014 relative to league average \u2014 in NBA history (see above), and they did it with four regulars who had an offensive rating over 115 points per 100: Dirk Nowitzki, Michael Finley, Steve Nash and Antawn Jamison. Nash and Nowitzki are particularly known as two of the greatest offensive forces to ever hit the hardwood, capable in their primes of lifting any offense to the top of the league, so it makes sense that they would combine to drive a historic offense. But that team also had a highly inefficient player right in the middle of it: Antoine Walker, who played nearly 72 percent of team minutes and used over 22 percent of possessions while on the court but generated just 100.7 points per 100 possessions.\n\nThough those Mavs were able to integrate him into their scheme and still score at an incredible rate, it\u2019s telling that there are hardly any Walkers to be found in today\u2019s best offenses. Instead, they are built more like the current Mavericks \u2014 a bunch of players who score at a hyper-efficient rate, all orbiting around one central Don\u010di\u0107-like figure who can do everything.\n\nCheck out our latest NBA predictions.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/luka-doncic-and-the-mavs-are-pushing-the-limits-of-offensive-efficiency/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "The Democratic Presidential Candidates Are Becoming Less Popular", "text": "Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nPoll(s) of the week\n\nBeing well-liked matters for presidential candidates: Generally speaking, they need to be at least somewhat popular to win.\n\nTo that effect, Monmouth University and Quinnipiac University each released a poll this week that asked voters whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of leading Democratic presidential candidates and President Trump, but what each pollster found was pretty different.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll found that Trump received the worst marks overall \u2014 a net favorability rating (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) of -17. This figure is 10 percentage points below the lowest-rated Democratic contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and 14 points worse than former Vice President Joe Biden, whose net favorability rating was -3. The Monmouth poll, on the other hand, put Trump\u2019s net favorability at -6, which made him more popular than any of the Democratic front-runners, with the exception of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg was actually the most well-liked candidate in both polls, but his standing is more in flux considering far fewer respondents knew enough about him to have an opinion, compared with those who said the same about Trump, Biden, Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Democratic primary, according to the early states\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? We know that many of 2020 front-runners aren\u2019t as popular as previous presidential contenders (at least at this point in the cycle), but among the general electorate, is Trump really as popular as many of the leading Democratic presidential contenders? To answer this question, we looked at all the national polls we could find since January (over 150 of them) that asked about how well-liked Trump and these candidates are. And as you can see in the chart below, despite one or two recent good polls for Trump, Trump remains really unpopular \u2014 far more than any of the leading Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nBut Democrats\u2019 net favorability ratings have taken a hit. As you can see in the chart above, even though Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg are nowhere near as unpopular as Trump, their net favorability ratings have trended downward recently. This isn\u2019t totally surprising, though, as my colleague Geoffrey Skelley noted a few weeks ago: Many presidential candidates\u2019 net favorability ratings have been negative or close to zero since at least 2008, a sign, perhaps, of the polarized times we live in.\n\nOf course, there is still time for public perception to change (in either direction) between now and November. But if the polls are any indication, opinions of the Democratic candidates seem much more likely to shift than opinions of Trump. That might be because people\u2019s opinions of the Democratic candidates aren\u2019t nearly as entrenched. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, told me that if you look at the breakdown of \u201csomewhat\u201d and \u201cvery\u201d favorable opinions for Trump and the Democratic candidates, \u201copinion about Trump is significantly more deeply held than opinion about any of the Democratic candidates right now.\u201d The same is true if you look at the breakdown of \u201csomewhat\u201d and \u201cvery\u201d unfavorable opinions for Trump and the Democratic candidates \u2014 Trump is much more actively disliked.\n\nOpinions are pretty set on Trump, but more flexible on Dems Share of respondents who said they had a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable or unfavorable opinion of President Trump and the four Democratic front-runners, according to an average of polls from Oct. 11 to Dec 11, 2019 Favorable Unfavorable Candidate Very Somewhat Difference Very Somewhat Difference Donald Trump 30.3 11.5 +18.8 47.8 9.5 +38.2 Joe Biden 19.4 24.9 -5.4 31.8 15.4 16.4 Bernie Sanders 20.7 23.1 -2.4 34.6 13.4 21.3 Elizabeth Warren 21.1 20.7 0.4 34.4 10.5 23.9 Pete Buttigieg 14.1 20.3 -6.2 23.3 12.4 10.9 Source: Polls\n\nSo though Trump may be less popular than his prospective Democratic opponents overall, he has a pretty high level of enthusiastic support \u2014 32 percent of respondents said they had a \u201cvery\u201d favorable opinion of him in an average of the last two months of polls. No Democratic contender has earned marks as high.\n\nThis isn\u2019t all that surprising considering Democrats still haven\u2019t settled on their nominee. Once they pick someone to take on Trump, this could all change, too, and the eventual Democratic nominee could end up even more unpopular than Trump \u2014 or maybe with an even more loyal fan base. We can\u2019t know at this point, but it does seem as if there is more opportunity for Democratic candidates to move public opinion \u2014 in either direction \u2014 than there is for Trump.\n\nOther polling bites\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of favorability ratings, the Monmouth and Quinnipiac polls mentioned above also had net favorability ratings for former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the most recent Democratic contender to enter the 2020 race. Unfortunately for Bloomberg, the results weren\u2019t very good. The Monmouth poll put his net approval among registered voters at -28 and the Quinnipiac poll at -19, making these the lowest marks that any one candidate received in both polls, including Trump. Ouch!\n\nHouse Democrats and the Trump administration reached a deal on Tuesday to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that updates the current North American Free Trade Agreement. According to a YouGov/Economist poll, 43 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the deal, 17 percent have an unfavorable view and 40 percent are not sure. The Senate is expected to vote on the deal in 2020.\n\n56 percent of Mexicans say the U.S. poses the greatest threat to their country in the future, while 27 percent cite the U.S. as Mexico\u2019s most dependable ally (around 5 percent said both concurrently), according to a poll by the Pew Research Center.\n\nThree in four Americans plan to have a Christmas tree in their home this year, according to a poll conducted by YouGov, but only 15 percent say they will buy a real tree. Thirty-eight percent plan to use an artificial tree they already own, while 11 percent plan to buy an artificial tree.\n\nMorning Consult collected surveys of nearly 375,000 adults and found that Fox News is the most-watched cable news outlet in the U.S. in more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s congressional districts (respondents were asked whether they watched CNN, Fox News or MSNBC). On average, 33 percent of adults say they watch the network at least once a week, followed by 28 percent who say they watch CNN and 20 percent who watch MSNBC.\n\nFairVote partnered with YouGov to release a poll of the South Carolina Democratic primary that simulates the primary under a ranked-choice voting system. The way it works is that voters rank the candidates by preference (with the ability to rank up to 10 of the 18 candidates or just the five candidates with the highest polling averages). The candidate with the fewest votes is then eliminated and his or her votes redistributed to each voters\u2019 next choice. This process is repeated until one candidate (the winner) is left.

According to Politico\u2019s polling tracker, Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 leads the field with about 29 percent of the vote, but needs a majority (51 percent) to win. If that doesn\u2019t happen, the election will go to a runoff in January.\n\nTrump approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 41.9 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -11.3 points). At this time last week, 41.8 percent approved and 53.3 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -11.5 points).

Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard was mentioned in almost twice as many cable news clips this week compared to last. Much of the cable news attention came when former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton suggested that Gabbard was being groomed by the Russians for a third-party run to undermine Democrats\u2019 chances in 2020. In fact, the most common words mentioned in 15-second clips mentioning Gabbard were \u201cHillary,\u201d \u201cClinton,\u201d \u201cRussian\u201d and \u201casset.\u201d\n\nBut Gabbard didn\u2019t get the same amount of attention across networks last week. She was mentioned in 66 clips on CNN and 71 clips on MSNBC, but 339 clips (almost five times as many) on Fox News.\n\nCheck out the data behind this series and check back each week for an update on which candidates are getting the most coverage on cable news.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-media-frenzy-around-biden-is-fading/", "author": ["Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "Introducing RAPTOR, Our New Metric For The Modern NBA", "text": "Introducing RAPTOR, Our New Metric For The Modern NBA Our scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should.\n\nAt FiveThirtyEight, we\u2019ve been running NBA predictions since 2015. We started with Elo ratings before introducing our CARMELO player projection system, which we then incorporated into our \u201cCARM-Elo\u201d season prediction model. We tested and tweaked the prediction model over the years, but it was always powered by metrics from other sources, such as Box Plus/Minus (BPM) and Real Plus-Minus (RPM).\n\nBut that changes this year. RAPTOR, which stands for Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings, is FiveThirtyEight\u2019s new NBA statistic. We\u2019re pretty excited about it. In addition to being a statistic that we bake in house, RAPTOR fulfills two long-standing goals of ours:\n\nFirst, we wanted to create a publicly available statistic that takes advantage of modern NBA data, specifically player tracking and play-by-play data that isn\u2019t available in traditional box scores.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, we wanted a statistic that better reflects how modern NBA teams actually evaluate players.\n\nNBA teams highly value floor spacing, defense and shot creation, and they place relatively little value on traditional big-man skills. RAPTOR likewise values these things \u2014 not because we made any deliberate attempt to design the system that way but because the importance of those skills emerges naturally from the data. RAPTOR thinks ball-dominant players such as James Harden and Steph Curry are phenomenally good. It highly values two-way wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It can have a love-hate relationship with centers, who are sometimes overvalued in other statistical systems. But it appreciates modern centers such as Nikola Joki\u0107 and Joel Embiid, as well as defensive stalwarts like Rudy Gobert.\n\nOur sports podcast, Hot Takedown, discusses RAPTOR\n\nThis article will go over some of the highlights of how RAPTOR works. For a much deeper and more technical description, you can find our methodological explainer here. But these are the highlights:\n\nLike BPM and RPM, RAPTOR is a plus-minus statistic that measures the number of points a player contributes to his team\u2019s offense and defense per 100 possessions, relative to a league-average player. For instance, a player with an offensive RAPTOR rating of +2.1 boosts his team\u2019s performance by 2.1 points per 100 offensive possessions while he is on the floor. Likewise, a player with a defensive RAPTOR of +3.4 would improve his team\u2019s defensive performance by 3.4 points per 100 possessions while he\u2019s on the court.\n\nPlus-minus statistics have certain inherent limitations, and RAPTOR is subject to those, too. Namely, these statistics assume that player performance is largely linear and additive, that is, that you can roughly add up the ratings from individual players to project team performance. In other words, RAPTOR does not account for coaching, systems or synergies between teammates.\n\nRAPTOR consists of two major components that are blended together to rate players: a \u201cbox\u201d (as in \u201cbox score\u201d) component, which uses individual statistics (including statistics derived from player tracking and play-by-play data), and an \u201con-off\u201d component, which evaluates a team\u2019s performance when the player and various combinations of his teammates are on or off the floor.\n\nThe variables included in \u201cbox\u201d RAPTOR were chosen by evaluating how they did in predicting long-term RAPM (real adjusted plus-minus), which is a measure of how a team\u2019s performance changes when the player is on and off the floor. Essentially, this is the same technique that BPM used, only RAPTOR uses play-by-play and player tracking statistics in addition to traditional ones. On offense, for instance, in addition to using traditional statistics like points, RAPTOR accounts for factors such as how many of a player\u2019s field goals were assisted and how valuable these assists were, the value of different types of offensive rebounds, time of possession and various measures of floor spacing, such as the number of contested 3-pointers that the player took. On defense, it looks at factors like how often the player was the nearest defender on an opponents\u2019 shot and how often those shots went in, how many points and rebounds were scored by opponents at the defender\u2019s position, and how often the player induced offensive fouls.\n\nThe \u201con-off\u201d element of RAPTOR evaluates how a player\u2019s team performed while he was on the floor, how the player\u2019s courtmates (the teammates that the player most often shared the court with) performed while they were on the floor without the player, and, finally, how those courtmates\u2019 other courtmates performed when they were on the floor without the player\u2019s courtmates, all adjusted for the strength of competition they were facing. We know it might sound a little goofy. But it\u2019s relatively simple to calculate. And it correlates very well with RAPM, while stabilizing a lot faster than RAPM, which can take years\u2019 worth of data to estimate reliably.\n\nthe player, and, finally, how those courtmates\u2019 other courtmates performed when they were on the floor without the player\u2019s courtmates, all adjusted for the strength of competition they were facing. We know it might sound a little goofy. But it\u2019s relatively simple to calculate. And it correlates very well with RAPM, while stabilizing a lot faster than RAPM, which can take years\u2019 worth of data to estimate reliably. Overall, however, RAPTOR weights the \u201cbox\u201d component more highly than the \u201con-off\u201d component. In testing RAPTOR on out-of-sample data, we found that while on-court/off-court stats provide useful information, they\u2019re nonetheless quite noisy as compared with individual measures of player value that are used in the \u201cbox\u201d part of RAPTOR.\n\nWhen applied to past data \u2014 for instance, in evaluating who the best players were in the 2018-19 season \u2014 RAPTOR is a descriptive statistic. Descriptive RAPTOR is based solely on a player\u2019s on-court performance and the performance of the player\u2019s teammates, as described above. It does not use priors based on a player\u2019s height, weight, age or any other factor.\n\nstatistic.

It does not use priors based on a player\u2019s height, weight, age or any other factor. However, RAPTOR can also be used to make team and player predictions, and indeed our NBA predictions are now fueled by RAPTOR. (We are retiring the CARMELO brand name from our previous projection system, although much of the code for RAPTOR projections is borrowed from CARMELO.) RAPTOR-driven predictions do use qualities such as height, age and draft position, and even whether a player recently appeared on an All-NBA team \u2014 that data improves the performance of the predictive measure. Predictions also weight variables slightly differently than descriptive RAPTOR does, as certain statistics are more subject to luck than others. We refer to this predictive version of RAPTOR as PREDATOR (PREDictive rApTOR).\n\nRAPTOR is based exclusively on publicly available data. There are other player-tracking statistics we believe could be highly helpful to RAPTOR, especially more detailed measures of on-ball defense, so we hope to be able to revisit RAPTOR as additional data becomes available.\n\nRAPTOR\u2019s name (in addition to being a whimsical backronym in the tradition of CARMELO and DRAYMOND) honors the 2018-19 Toronto Raptors, which FiveThirtyEight\u2019s previous projection system correctly predicted had an edge over the Golden State Warriors (even though we didn\u2019t fully believe the projection ourselves at the time).\n\nThe full-fledged version of RAPTOR is available for the 2013-14 season onward, as that\u2019s when the NBA\u2019s player-tracking data came on line. We also have a historical version of RAPTOR called Approximate RAPTOR dating back to 1976-1977, the first season after the ABA-NBA merger, but that uses a far more limited range of data.\n\nRAPTOR ratings for players with at least 1,000 minutes played in a season since 2013-14 can be found in the table below. As you can see, RAPTOR generally loves perimeter players and wings, such as Curry, Harden, Leonard and Chris Paul, although some frontcourt players like Jokic, Anthony Davis and Draymond Green are also rated highly by the system. For more detail on past RAPTORs, including the breakdown of box and on-off components, you can download files that list the regular season and playoffs separately, or a version that combines a

The ball hit a 2-year-old girl, who was rushed out of the stadium. The game stopped as an emotional Almora dropped to a knee. Less than two weeks later, as the Washington Nationals played the White Sox in Chicago, a woman sitting just past the third-base dugout was struck in the face. Less than two weeks after that, a Dodger Stadium spectator sitting just past the netting on the first-base line was hit in the head by a hard line drive off the bat of right fielder Cody Bellinger.\n\nBloomberg News estimated in 2014 that 1,750 fans per year are hurt by batted balls at MLB games. Amid debates over how much protection teams should offer spectators, we wanted to find out which areas of stadiums might be the most dangerous, which could help us figure out what could be done to prevent more fan injuries.\n\nBecause there\u2019s no central database of all of MLB\u2019s foul balls, we had to compile a data set ourselves. To do that, we searched the batted-ball data for this season on Baseball Savant to find the 10 stadiums that produced the most foul balls up to June 5 and then analyzed the pitch-level data from the most foul-heavy game day at each of those stadiums (including one doubleheader). Because we had to individually research each foul ball, we couldn\u2019t look at a whole season\u2019s worth of fouls. By limiting the data set to the most foul-heavy days of play in those 10 stadiums, we aimed to keep the data set to a manageable size while also capturing the largest number of fouls we could from a variety of parks, since stadiums vary dramatically in architecture, altitude and seating arrangements.\n\nDozens of fouls per game in the most foul-heavy parks The most foul-heavy day at each of the 10 stadiums that produced the most fouls this season, as of June 5 Most foul-heavy day Stadium Average No. of Fouls per game Date Matchup No. of Fouls Camden Yards* 57 4/20/19 Baltimore Orioles vs. Minnesota Twins 113 PNC Park 57 6/1/19 Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Milwaukee Brewers 111 Oakland Coliseum 53 6/2/19 Oakland A\u2019s vs. Houston Astros 109 T-Mobile Park 53 5/18/19 Seattle Mariners vs. Minnesota Twins 100 Globe Life Park 55 5/3/19 Texas Rangers vs. Toronto Blue Jays 87 Dodger Stadium 51 3/29/19 Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Arizona Diamondsbacks 86 Miller Park 55 5/4/19 Milwaukee Brewers vs. New York Mets 85 Citizens Bank Park 53 4/27/19 Philadelphia Phillies vs. Miami Marlins 75 SunTrust Park 53 4/14/19 Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets 73 Yankee Stadium 51 3/31/19 New York Yankees vs. Baltimore Orioles 67 * Includes both games of the doubleheader Source: Baseball Savant\n\nWe watched clips of 906 foul balls hit during those games (excluding foul tips, which were never in danger of reaching the stands, and fouls that resulted in outs, because Baseball Savant groups those with other types of caught-ball outs, so we couldn\u2019t get data on foul outs specifically), and we recorded whether the fouls were grounders, fly balls, line drives or pop-ups. Then we split the parks into \u201czones\u201d to categorize the general area where each of those balls landed.\n\nZones 1, 2 and 3 include seats that are largely protected by netting \u2014 the area behind home plate and both dugouts \u2014 along with the corresponding areas of foul territory on the field. Zones 4 and 5 are mostly non-netted seating areas and the foul territory outside the baselines, from the dugout to the foul pole. Zones 6 and 7 cover the areas past the foul poles; the fly balls that land here typically have too much arc to be dangerous, and line drives rarely make it that far.\n\nLess than half of the foul balls we charted were followed by a camera to where they landed. But by gauging angles, we estimated where all of the fouls \u2014 both those that were followed by a camera and those that weren\u2019t \u2014 likely landed. We tested our predictions against the footage of the balls that were followed to check our accuracy.\n\nNearly equal shares of foul balls ended up in zones with netting vs. zones that largely lack netting: 454 balls landed in zones 1, 2 and 3, while 452 balls fell in zones 4 through 7.\n\nThe scariest foul balls are those with high exit velocities, particularly the line drives, which give spectators only seconds \u2014 or fractions of a second \u2014 to react. Statcast was able to measure exit velocities for 580 of the 906 foul balls in our data set, and most of the hardest-hit of those 580 landed in areas that are primarily unprotected. Of the fly balls with recorded exit velocities of 90 mph or higher, 71.8 percent landed in zones 4 and 5. And all of the line drives that left the bat at 90 mph or more landed in those same zones. That\u2019s the type of hit that injured the toddler at this year\u2019s Cubs-Astros game or that blinded a man in one eye at Wrigley Field in 2017.\n\nMajor league stadiums have slowly been installing more netting around the field. Players have been pushing the issue, including Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill, who called the MLB Players Association to voice his support for more protective netting. In 2015, MLB encouraged teams to extend netting to the \u201cnear ends of both dugouts.\u201d By 2018, all 30 stadiums had exceeded that recommendation, installing netting from one end of the dugout to the other. After the incident at Guaranteed Rate Field, the White Sox announced that they would implement netting from foul pole to foul pole, and crews worked during the All-Star break to install the new nets. The Washington Nationals also used the break to add netting.\n\nBut more netting won\u2019t protect every fan. Linda Goldbloom was sitting high above home plate in Dodger Stadium \u2014 in zone 1, where netting is provided \u2014 last year when she was struck and killed by a high fly ball that had an exit velocity of just 73 mph. And a woman at Tropicana Field was hospitalized in 2016 after she was hit by a fly ball that found its way through a hole in the netting just to the left of the first-base dugout.\n\nThe efforts that other leagues make to ensure the safety of their spectators could serve as a blueprint for MLB. Take the Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball Organization, where the stadiums have netting from foul pole to foul pole. Whenever a ball is hit into the stands, fans are warned with loud whistles blown by staff stationed in their seating section, and animated warning videos are played before every game. As a result, unprotected seats are something of a luxury in Japan. The Tokyo Dome offers \u201cexciting seats\u201d near the foul lines, which come equipped with helmets and gloves.\n\nEven with extensive netting, no one will ever be completely safe at a baseball game. But there are ways for MLB to protect its fans from foul balls \u2014 particularly in the most dangerous areas of the park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that you just hold your breath for a second,\u201d Hill told The Los Angeles Times. \u201cYou just hope it hits a seat, not a person.\u201d\n\nNeil Paine contributed research.\n\nCheck out our latest MLB predictions.\n\nCORRECTION (July 15, 2019, 5 p.m.): A previous version of this story referred to the data as having been collected from the 10 most foul-ball-heavy games this season. It was actually collected from the 10 most foul-ball-heavy game days \u2014 one day included a doubleheader.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-watched-906-foul-balls-to-find-out-where-the-most-dangerous-ones-land/", "author": ["Annette Choi"]}, {"title": "What Our Inbox Tells Us About How Democrats Are Tackling Trump", "text": "Democrats running for president in 2020 are faced with a choice when making their pitch to voters: make attacking President Trump a key part of their message or ignore him and focus on introducing themselves and their ideas.\n\nOn the one hand, criticizing Trump could help candidates convince primary voters that they\u2019re able to defeat him, but depending on what shots they choose to take, they could risk alienating voters in the general election. So we wanted to see how the candidates tackled this choice by looking at one of the most direct ways they regularly communicate with voters \u2014 their emails.\n\nLindsey Cormack, who runs the DCinbox project, a public database of email newsletters sent by members of Congress, says emails, like tweets, can give us insight into how politicians try to brand themselves. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to deal with editors at the paper. They don\u2019t have to deal with booking an agent to be on a TV or radio program. They can really say anything they want.\u201d\n\nSo to get a better sense of what the candidates told their followers about Trump, we subscribed to the mailing list of every candidate that FiveThirtyEight considers \u201cmajor\u201d and looked at all the emails they sent in the month prior to the first Democratic debate. (Though, for a variety of reasons \u2014 including email targeting practices, engagement testing techniques and the fact that we haven\u2019t given money to any of these campaigns \u2014 we may not have received all the emails sent by all the campaigns. )\n\nOverall, the candidates have taken very different approaches. Some candidates, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, seem to be ignoring Trump almost entirely, while others, like former Vice President Joe Biden, are heavily peppering their emails with invocations of Trump. Even some lesser-known candidates like Montana Gov. Steve Bullock are going all in on Trump \u2014 every email we received from his campaign during this period contained a reference to the president.\n\nBiden\u2019s emails contained the second-most mentions of Trump. In total, we received 27 messages from his campaign that referenced the president by name. This strong focus on Trump seems aimed at portraying Biden as a strong general election candidate, which makes sense, as his perceived \u201celectability\u201d has been a central argument of his campaign.\n\nIn his emails, Biden has attacked Trump\u2019s campaign tactics, his policy stances and his values. Biden has even sent an email that, rather than concentrating on his campaign, asked readers to sign a petition to \u201ctell Donald Trump that welcoming foreign interference in our elections is unacceptable.\u201d Even many of Biden\u2019s fundraising emails are all about Trump, asking readers to \u201cimagine the shock on Trump\u2019s face\u201d when they hit their fundraising goal and collect enough to \u201ccompete with Trump\u2019s fortunes.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden mentions Trump often, his emails completely ignore the rest of the primary field \u2014 none of his messages mention another Democratic candidate by name. Another thing Biden never mentions? Impeachment.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a telling omission, because many other candidates have called for Trump\u2019s impeachment and are renewing those calls in their emails. The move could help them in the primary election, as impeachment is popular among Democrats, but could prove risky in a general election because most polls find that more Americans oppose impeachment than support it.\n\nIn the month leading up to the first debate, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Cabinet secretary Julian Castro, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Sen. Cory Booker, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and former Gov. John Hickenlooper all sent at least one email entirely devoted to calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. O\u2019Rourke, for example, sent a long email on May 30 explaining why he thought Trump should be impeached, and then a punchier one about two weeks later with \u201cDonald Trump\u201d as the subject line and \u201c\u2026 should be impeached\u201d as the only text in the body of the email, with a link to a petition.\n\nWhile Warren was the first 2020 Democratic candidate to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2014 she publicly embraced that stance after the April release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 we didn\u2019t receive any emails from her campaign that mentioned the topic in the month before the first debate. Likewise, Sanders has also called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, but didn\u2019t send us any impeachment emails during the period we looked at.\n\nSome candidates largely avoided talking about Trump at all in the month before the debate. For example, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg only mentioned Trump in one email, when he called Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexican goods \u201cpolitically-motivated gamesmanship.\u201d Warren also was largely silent on Trump in this period. Of the 56 emails she sent us that month, only four mentioned Trump, and of those four, only one focused on him for the bulk of the message. That email explained, \u201cOur campaign isn\u2019t about Donald Trump. That\u2019s because he\u2019s just the symptom, not the cause, of the crises we face as a country.\u201d And Rep. Tim Ryan, who sent us 78 emails \u2014 the most of any candidate \u2014 didn\u2019t mention Trump even once, although he, too, has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nBullock, on the other hand, mentioned Trump in every single email, often as part of a formulaic reminder to subscribers that he is the only presidential candidate to have won statewide office in a state Trump won.\n\nCandidates who have a harder time making an \u201celectability\u201d argument than Bullock varied widely in the tenor of their emails that mentioned Trump. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, for example, sent us fewer emails in the month leading up to the debate than most candidates, but he mentioned Trump in five of the seven emails he did send us. (And one the two that didn\u2019t mention the president\u2019s last name still used the hashtag #ConDon, which showed up in six of de Blasio\u2019s emails and is meant to imply that Trump is a con man.) In many ways, De Blasio seemed to be trying to out-Trump Trump, aggressively attacking him and using name-calling tactics that the president is known for. In one email, for instance, he called Trump a \u201cNew York con man who\u2019s just been made to smell his own BS\u201d and referred to Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, as Trump\u2019s \u201clapdog,\u201d whose insults were \u201ceven lamer than his boss\u2019s.\u201d But unlike de Blasio, most of the Democratic contenders seemed to have heeded former First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s advice to \u201cgo high\u201d when their opponents \u201cgo low\u201d and are trying to strike a different tone than the current president, rather than trying to outdo him.\n\nSo what does this tell us about how Democrats are crafting (or not crafting) their campaigns around Trump? Well, a few candidates, like de Blasio, Bullock and Biden, are at one extreme \u2014 mentioning Trump at practically every opportunity \u2014 and a few, like Ryan and Buttigieg, are firmly planted at the other extreme, remaining largely silent on Trump. But perhaps unsurprisingly, most candidates fall somewhere in between, striking a balance between talking about Trump and focusing on their own message. It\u2019s early yet, though, and some candidates\u2019 communication strategies might change as the primary progresses. Still, with so many Democrats running, the party will have collectively tried out many different avenues of attack before the general election. Ultimately, however, there will only be one Democratic nominee, and whoever that is, he or she will have a wide pool of pre-tested approaches to draw from.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democrats-are-campaigning-on-trump/", "author": ["Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "A Better Way To Evaluate NBA Defense", "text": "Basketball, in some sense, is fundamentally a shooting game. Shooting isn\u2019t the only important action that takes place on a basketball court, obviously. But if no one kept track of who was taking shots and making buckets, we\u2019d have, at best, an extremely fuzzy impression of which players were actually any good, even if we had access to all their other statistics.\n\nBut believe it or not, this had long been the situation when it came to measuring player defense. There are individual defensive statistics such as rebounds and steals, of course. But there\u2019s no direct measure of shooting defense (other than blocks, which account for a relatively small fraction of missed shots). If an opponent gets hot against your team and shoots 53 for 91 en route to scoring 130 points, we know your team defended poorly in the aggregate, but we don\u2019t know which players to blame.\n\nThat is, until a few years ago, when the NBA started publishing data on opponents\u2019 shooting. Last regular season, for example, NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert defended a league-high 1,426 shots, according to motion tracking data by Second Spectrum, which identifies the nearest defender on every field goal attempt. Opponents made only 45 percent of those field goal attempts, well below the roughly 49 percent that Second Spectrum estimates \u201cshould\u201d have gone in against average defense for a given distance to the basket.\n\nWe\u2019ve been obsessed with this opponents\u2019 shooting data for a while, in part because it sometimes seemed to track closely with players who had stronger or weaker defensive reputations than you would infer from other advanced statistics such as Real Plus-Minus. Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving was regarded as a slightly above-average defender by RPM last year, for instance. But his opponents\u2019 shooting data suggests he\u2019s a big liability instead. On the other hand, Toronto\u2019s Serge Ibaka was an excellent defender based on opponents\u2019 shooting, whereas RPM regards him as just average.\n\nSo this year, we decided to evaluate the opponents\u2019 shooting data in a more comprehensive way and incorporate it into our projection system, CARMELO. Just as CARMELO is a goofy backronym (Career-Arc Regression Model Estimator with Local Optimization) that honors one of our favorite players, Carmelo Anthony, we decided to give our new defensive rating a player-centric name, this time in honor of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Draymond Green, who has long been one of the best players in basketball by opponent shooting. So our new rating is called DRAYMOND, which stands for\u2026.\n\nDefensive\n\nRating\n\nAccounting for\n\nYielding\n\nMinimal\n\nOpenness by\n\nNearest\n\nDefender\n\n\ud83d\ude44\n\nAll right, so the acronym may or may not catch on. But it does get at one essential discovery we made in playing around with the opponents\u2019 shooting data: the idea of minimizing openness. The main goal of shooting defense, especially in today\u2019s spacing-centric, ball-movement-forward offensive era, is really to minimize the chance of an open shot.\n\nSo when I cited Gobert\u2019s numbers earlier in this article, for instance, the most impressive part was not that opponents shot poorly against him, although that helped the Jazz, of course. Rather, it was that he was the nearest defender on so many shots: about 26 shots per 100 possessions that he was on the floor last year as compared with a league average of about 17 shots defended per 100 possessions. By contrast, Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook \u2014 whom DRAYMOND regards as being vastly overrated by other defensive metrics \u2014 was the nearest defender on only 12 shots per 100 possessions. Some of this has to do with Westbrook\u2019s and Gobert\u2019s respective positions \u2014 centers naturally defend more shots than guards do, a factor that DRAYMOND corrects for (see below). But even accounting for that, it\u2019s clear that some players are much more impactful defenders than others.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re curious to see some data, but first, an explanation of how DRAYMOND is calculated. We\u2019ll keep it pretty brief.\n\nAs I mentioned above, what we\u2019re really interested in is how much value a defender provides relative to an open shot. That is to say, we generally don\u2019t want to punish a player for happening to be the nearest defender according to the Second Spectrum data. Some defense is generally better than none; if Player X hadn\u2019t defended the shot, it\u2019s possible that no one else would have.\n\nThrough trial and error, we found that DRAYMOND performs best if you assume that shooting percentages on open shots are about 8 percentage points higher than against average defense. For instance, if a certain type of above-the-break 3-pointer is made 34 percent of the time against average defense, we\u2019d expect it to go in about 42 percent of the time if it was truly open.\n\nThis allows us to calculate an initial score that we call RAW_DRAYMOND. For example, if a player faced 100 2-point shots and allowed 46 of them to go in when you\u2019d expect 56 percent of them to be converted if wide open, that player prevented \u2026\n\n(.56-.46) x 100 x 2 = 20\n\n\u2026 about 20 points from being scored with his defense. (Obviously, this player could have provided additional value based on his defense against 3-point shots. Indeed, since 3-point shots are worth more than 2-pointers \u2014 hashtag #math \u2014 players who are effective at defending threes are especially rewarded by DRAYMOND.)\n\nHowever, there are several adjustments we need to make in getting from RAW_DRAYMOND to regular DRAYMOND:\n\nSince DRAYMOND is based on both regular-season and playoff data, we adjust for the fact that defenders face slightly tougher shooters on average in the playoffs.\n\nWe divide RAW_DRAYMOND by the number of possessions that the player was on the floor, so that DRAYMOND (like RPM and most other NBA stats) is a rate statistic rather than a counting statistic.\n\nWe adjust the number of shots defended based on a player\u2019s position. The average point guard and shooting guard defends about 15 shots per 100 possessions, the average small forward defends about 16 shots, the average power forward 19 shots, and the average center 22 shots. This somewhat equalizes defensive value over the five positions. Even so, bigs are generally the most valuable defenders in basketball according to DRAYMOND, as they are under most other advanced statistics.\n\nFinally, we subtract the value of league-average shooting defense per possession from each player\u2019s score. Thus, like RPM and Box Plus/Minus (BPM), the statistics that CARMELO has traditionally used to make its projections, DRAYMOND is a plus-minus statistic measured per 100 possessions, where a score of 0 represents average defense.\n\nAmong players who have played at least 10,000 possessions over the past six seasons (the NBA\u2019s opponents\u2019 shooting data goes back to 2013-14), the top defender according to DRAYMOND is \u2026 Draymond Green, who has provided the Warriors with +3.2 points per 100 possessions of defensive value based on his scoring defense alone, not counting all of the other ways (e.g., steals) that he produces defensive value. Green is followed on the list by a fairly star-studded cast of defenders: Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis (!), Rudy Gobert, Tim Duncan, Andre Roberson and Anthony Davis.

To test this \u2014 and I have to apologize because there are a lot of similarly named statistics here with confusing acronyms \u2014 we regressed DRAYMOND and defensive BPM against five-year defensive Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (RAPM). What the hell does that mean? BPM is based on conventional box score statistics \u2014 most importantly rebounds, blocks and steals for the purposes of measuring defense. DRAYMOND is based on opponents\u2019 shooting. RAPM, meanwhile, measures how much better or worse a team plays when a player is on or off the floor. In the long run, RAPM is basically the \u201cright\u201d way to measure player value, since it can account for all the direct and indirect contributions a player makes that may or may not have a corresponding statistic attached to them. In the short run and even the medium run, however (remember all that misleading data people cited about how the Warriors were so good without Kevin Durant?), RAPM can be extremely noisy. So RAPM is great if you\u2019re looking back over a five-year sample, as we\u2019re doing here, but on-court/off-court statistics need to be treated with extreme caution over small samples.\n\nIn any event, what we found is that BPM and DRAYMOND basically do equally well in predicting long-term RAPM. What that means is that the opponents\u2019 shooting data is basically as powerful as all box score defensive statistics combined in predicting how much value a player\u2019s defense truly has over the long run.\n\nWe also found, however, that BPM and DRAYMOND are largely not redundant with one another. Blocks, steals and rebounds, which BPM captures, are certainly valuable things, and DRAYMOND does not purport to measure those. But they are also not especially good proxies for shooting defense. There are some players such as Green and Gobert who are even better defenders than you\u2019d gather from their box score stats, even though those stats are pretty good. But there are others like Trevor Ariza, who gets lots of steals but has been rated poorly by DRAYMOND in recent seasons. That doesn\u2019t mean that Ariza is a poor defender, just that you need to take the good (steals) with the bad (allows opponents to convert field goals at a high rate) when evaluating him.\n\nLet\u2019s conclude with a list of players who are most affected, positively or negatively, by the incorporation of DRAYMOND. The table below compares our old CARMELO defensive ratings, which were based on a mix of two-thirds RPM and one-third BPM, to our new version, which still uses these statistics but also uses DRAYMOND. Here are the old and new defensive ratings for everyone with at least 10,000 possessions played since 2013-14.\n\nWhich players\u2019 defense had been underrated or overrated?

Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There\u2019s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic.\n\nCases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents\u2019 shooting data than what we\u2019ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.\n\nWe used math to help LeBron cast \u2018Space Jam 2\u2019\n\nCheck out our NBA player ratings.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-better-way-to-evaluate-nba-defense/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "The State Of The State Of The States", "text": "Whether it\u2019s a groundbreaking experiment of conservative or liberal thought or \u201cmerely\u201d tending to the bread-and-butter issues that touch residents\u2019 lives, the states are where the policymaking magic happens. And because of the different roles played by the state and federal governments, what\u2019s happening in the states can vary pretty substantially from what\u2019s being discussed on the national level. So we decided to burst out of the bubble of the national 2020 campaign and take a look at what state leaders were talking about.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, each governor lays out their policy priorities in their version of the State of the Union address \u2014 a \u201cstate of the state\u201d address. We conducted a text analysis of all 50 governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches to see what issues were talked about the most and whether there were differences between what Democratic and Republican governors were focusing on. Specifically, we broke down the speeches into one-, two- and three-word phrases (like \u201cschool\u201d or the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) and divided the most commonly used ones into thematic buckets.\n\nWe found that the three most dominant issues were education, health care and the economy \u2014 although Democratic and Republican governors didn\u2019t always approach them in the same way. There were also interesting partisan differences in how governors talked about some other issues, including the environment, crime and justice, and mental health.\n\nEducation\n\nThe words \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cschool\u201d appeared in all 23 Democratic speeches and all 27 Republican ones. But that doesn\u2019t mean the two parties focused on the same aspects of education. To suss out those differences, we ran a statistical analysis to determine how significantly terms were associated with speeches from Democratic or Republican governors. And as you can see in the table below, some terms (e.g., \u201cchild care,\u201d \u201ckindergarten\u201d) were more likely to be used in Democratic speeches, while others (e.g., \u201cfoster care,\u201d \u201ceducation workforce\u201d) were more likely to be used in Republican speeches.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on education One-, two- and three-word phrases about education that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nchild care 0.02 39.1% 7.4% D+31.7 education need 0.00 30.4 0.0 D+30.4 kindergarten 0.07 47.8 18.5 D+29.3 early childhood 0.06 43.5 14.8 D+28.7 educational 0.12 21.7 48.2 R+26.4 students state 0.01 26.1 0.0 D+26.1 scholarships 0.10 13.0 37.0 R+24.0 graduate 0.22 56.5 33.3 D+23.2 learning 0.27 43.5 66.7 R+23.2 educators deserve 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 foster care 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 quality education 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 school district 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 graduates 0.19 17.4 37.0 R+19.7 teacher pay 0.19 17.4 37.0 R+19.7 early childhood education 0.13 30.4 11.1 D+19.3 graduation 0.24 21.7 40.7 R+19.0 education workforce 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 college tuition 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 schools year 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 special education 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 tuition 0.29 43.5 25.9 D+17.6 scholarship 0.27 17.4 33.3 R+15.9 teacher 0.51 52.2 66.7 R+14.5 best brightest 0.15 4.4 18.5 R+14.2 year degree 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 training programs 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 children future 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 community college 0.40 34.8 22.2 D+12.6 teachers 0.62 82.6 70.4 D+12.2 classroom 0.55 52.2 40.7 D+11.4 school districts 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 universities 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 school students 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 graduate high school 0.35 21.7 11.1 D+10.6 young children 0.35 21.7 11.1 D+10.6 bachelor degree 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 children foster care 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 school student 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 school boards 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 parents teachers 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 teacher pay raise 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 high school college 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 public schools 0.56 43.5 33.3 D+10.2 class education 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 world class education 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 dedicated teachers 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 high schools 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 teacher salaries 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 computer science 0.52 17.4 25.9 R+8.5 high school 0.74 69.6 77.8 R+8.2 superintendent 0.59 21.7 29.6 R+7.9 students 0.79 100.0 92.6 D+7.4 educators 0.72 43.5 37.0 D+6.4 university 0.77 56.5 63.0 R+6.4 early education 0.55 17.4 11.1 D+6.3 help students 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 colleges 0.73 39.1 33.3 D+5.8 day kindergarten 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 education opportunity 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 school buildings 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 funding education 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 state college 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 technical education 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 students parents 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 student debt 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 post secondary 0.63 13.0 18.5 R+5.5 middle school 0.63 13.0 18.5 R+5.5 local school 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 stem 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 math 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 public school 0.76 21.7 25.9 R+4.2 higher education 0.84 47.8 51.9 R+4.0 college 0.88 73.9 77.8 R+3.9 education funding 0.78 26.1 22.2 D+3.9 apprenticeship 0.80 21.7 18.5 D+3.2 schools 0.91 95.7 92.6 D+3.1 apprenticeship programs 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 college degree 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 education budget 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 education programs 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 good education 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 graduation rate 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 12 schools 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 local school districts 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 students like 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 students graduate 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 elementary school 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 colleges universities 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 schools need 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 classrooms 0.93 39.1 40.7 R+1.6 schools state 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 teaching 0.96 30.4 29.6 D+0.8 public education 0.96 30.4 29.6 D+0.8 12 education 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 elementary 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 community colleges 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 high school students 0.99 26.1 25.9 D+0.2 education 1.00 100.0 100.0 EVEN school 1.00 100.0 100.0 EVEN Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

But on the state level, those ideas came up in only a handful of gubernatorial speeches \u2014 mostly Democratic ones. Democratic governors were more loquacious about another progressive priority, \u201cearly childhood education,\u201d which was mentioned by seven Democratic governors and three Republican ones.\n\nHealth care\n\nAnother issue governors talked a lot about was health care \u2014 especially Democratic governors. That makes sense considering that health care was the No. 1 issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, which is when many of those Democratic governors were elected.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on health care One-, two- and three-word phrases about health care that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nsick 0.01 39.1% 3.7% D+35.4 affordable care act 0.01 39.1 3.7 D+35.4 health care 0.25 100.0 70.4 D+29.6 healthy 0.15 60.9 33.3 D+27.5 expand medicaid 0.02 30.4 3.7 D+26.7 access health 0.06 30.4 7.4 D+23.0 reproductive health 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 pre existing conditions 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 cost health 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 existing conditions 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 hospital 0.19 43.5 22.2 D+21.3 medical 0.32 65.2 44.4 D+20.8 epidemic 0.17 39.1 18.5 D+20.6 dr 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 access health care 0.10 26.1 7.4 D+18.7 health outcomes 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 health insurance 0.29 43.5 25.9 D+17.6 hospitals 0.26 34.8 18.5 D+16.3 doctor 0.24 30.4 14.8 D+15.6 health care costs 0.21 26.1 11.1 D+15.0 affordable health care 0.18 21.7 7.4 D+14.3 expanded medicaid 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 healthier 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 public health 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 behavioral health 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 health services 0.57 30.4 22.2 D+8.2 health 0.79 100.0 92.6 D+7.4 medicaid 0.74 52.2 59.3 R+7.1 quality health care 0.55 17.4 11.1 D+6.3 medicaid program 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 children health 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 health crisis 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 health challenges 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 illness 0.80 21.7 18.5 D+3.2 health substance 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 medicaid expansion 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

A lower p-value means that the partisanship of a phrase in our data set is more statistically distinguishable. Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nDemocratic governors were more likely than Republican ones to utter almost every health care-related phrase we looked at. For instance, more Democratic governors (nine of them, or 39 percent) used the phrase \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d (the health care law passed under former President Barack Obama) than Republican governors (one, or 4 percent). And four Democratic governors called for their states to \u201cexpand Medicaid\u201d \u2014 all of them, perhaps unsurprisingly, in states with divided government (where the governor, state Senate and/or state House are controlled by different parties). This could be because Medicaid expansion has recently passed in several red states and is broadly popular, making it a fertile issue for bipartisan cooperation. Or it could be simply because every Democratic-controlled state has expanded Medicaid already.\n\nMostly missing, however, from all the health care talk was an endorsement of a single-payer health-insurance system \u2014 a major policy priority of some Democratic presidential candidates. Democrat Gavin Newsom of California was the only governor to mention \u201csingle payer\u201d health care, or the idea that the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care with private insurance plans effectively eliminated, but he mentioned it only as a \u201clong-term goal.\u201d Likewise, only Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington urged his legislature to create a \u201cpublic health option,\u201d which would give people the ability to buy into a government-administered insurance plan. (His state went on this year to pass legislation that created this option.)\n\nThe economy\n\nThe third nearly ubiquitous issue in state of the state addresses was the economy. While rhetoric about jobs was bipartisan (\u201cjob\u201d or \u201cjobs\u201d appeared in every speech), Republican and Democratic governors approached other aspects of economic policy differently.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on the economy One-, two- and three-word phrases about the economy that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how

Interestingly, eight of the nine were speaking to a friendly (i.e., Democratic) legislature, indicating how raising the minimum wage is a priority for Democratic-controlled states.\n\nEnergy and the environment\n\nWe found differences among Republican and Democratic speeches on other policy issues as well.

There was a similar partisan split (11 to one) in calls for \u201cclean energy.\u201d By contrast, Republicans tended to framed their environmental goals around protecting \u201cnatural resources\u201d (a phrase that appeared in eight GOP speeches and three Democratic ones).\n\nCriminal justice\n\nCriminal-justice reform seems to be one of the few remaining bipartisan issues these days, and, fittingly, the term \u201ccriminal justice\u201d appeared in 13 Republican speeches and in 12 Democratic ones.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on criminal justice One-, two- and three-word phrases about criminal justice that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nprison 0.01 21.7% 74.1% R+52.3 enforcement 0.03 21.7 63.0 R+41.2 law enforcement 0.03 21.7 63.0 R+41.2 gun violence 0.00 34.8 0.0 D+34.8 public safety 0.10 30.4 63.0 R+32.5 corrections 0.04 8.7 37.0 R+28.3 violence 0.13 52.2 25.9 D+26.2 gun safety 0.01 26.1 0.0 D+26.1 prisons 0.10 13.0 37.0 R+24.0 school safety 0.06 4.4 25.9 R+21.6 correctional 0.14 13.0 33.3 R+20.3 gun 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 attorney general 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 local law enforcement 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 schools safer 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 prison population 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 crime 0.28 26.1 44.4 R+18.4 violent 0.32 21.7 37.0 R+15.3 offenders 0.38 17.4 29.6 R+12.2 criminal 0.62 52.2 63.0 R+10.8 violent crime 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 non violent 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 police officer 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 law enforcement officers 0.45 13.0 22.2 R+9.2 police officers 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 criminal justice reform 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 victims 0.76 21.7 25.9 R+4.2 criminal justice 0.84 52.2 48.2 D+4.0 state police 0.82 17.4 14.8 D+2.6 violent offenders 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 recidivism rate 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 police 0.96 43.5 44.4 R+1.0 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nBut Republican governors also lived up to their party\u2019s historical \u201ctough on crime\u201d reputation, at least through their rhetoric. For instance, they were far more likely to nod to \u201cpublic safety,\u201d a phrase used by 17 GOP governors but seven Democrats. And while 17 Republicans mentioned \u201claw enforcement\u201d in their state of the state addresses, only five Democrats did. Republicans also talked more about \u201cprisons\u201d and \u201ccorrections\u201d than Democrats did \u2014 however, their language surrounding it wasn\u2019t always \u201ctough.\u201d For example, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds touted her state\u2019s apprenticeship programs that try to reintegrate inmates in society: \u201cMost of our inmates aren\u2019t inmates for life. They will reenter society \u2014 and when they do, we want them to be successful. Those who can\u2019t get a job often find their way back to crime and then back to prison.\u201d Several other Republican governors discussed the need to reduce their \u201cprison population.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, it was mostly Democratic governors who talked about guns. For example, eight Democratic governors used the term \u201cgun violence,\u201d but no Republicans did so. Notably, only two Republican governors even mentioned the \u201cSecond Amendment.\u201d More frequently, Republicans talked about guns in the context of \u201cschool safety,\u201d a phrase used in seven GOP speeches and one Democratic one.\n\nMental health\n\nMore Republican governors (18) than Democratic ones (10) used the phrase \u201cmental health\u201d in their state of the state addresses, and a third of those Republicans \u2014 six of the 18 \u2014 did so in the context of violence in schools. For example, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said, \u201cTo keep our classrooms safe, we must also address the mental health issues that often lead to school violence.\u201d\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on mental health One-, two- and three-word phrases about mental health that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nmental health 0.27 43.5% 66.7% R+23.2 drugs 0.24 21.7 40.7 R+19.0 drug 0.44 43.5 59.3 R+15.8 addiction 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 mental health issues 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 opioid addiction 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 overdose 0.57 26.1 18.5 D+7.6 opioid 0.71 47.8 40.7 D+7.1 substance 0.69 30.4 37.0 R+6.6 mental health care 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 substance use 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 opioid crisis 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 substance abuse 0.78 26.1 22.2 D+3.9 mental health substance 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 mental health services 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 mental illness 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

A lower p-value means that the partisanship of a phrase in our data set is more statistically distinguishable. Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nOther Republicans spoke about mental health more broadly. For instance, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu discussed overhauling the state\u2019s mental health care system and reducing suicide rates. And four Republican governors brought up mental health in the context of drug addiction. Republicans were also likelier than Democrats to discuss \u201copioid addiction,\u201d but \u201copioid\u201d overall was relatively common in both Democratic and Republican speeches.\n\nAs for immigration and abortion, two issues that have recently been prominent on the national level, we didn\u2019t find a lot of discussion of them in the governors\u2019 speeches. Only three gubernatorial speeches included the word \u201cimmigration,\u201d and related terms were similarly rare. When they did come up, there was a noticeable partisan divide: For example, Democrats were more likely to use the word \u201cimmigrants\u201d (four speeches to two), while Republicans were more likely to reference the \u201cborder\u201d (five speeches to one). Similarly, just two governors mentioned abortion: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, who is a supporter of abortion rights, and Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, who is against abortion. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that state governments aren\u2019t legislating on abortion \u2014 we know that they are \u2014 but it\u2019s notable that so few governors mentioned it in their speeches.\n\nSetting partisan differences aside, a lot of governors agreed on one thing in particular: that the state of their state was strong! Of the dozens of governors who included the phrase \u201cthe state of our state is \u2026\u201d in their state of the state address, at least 16 followed it with \u201cstrong\u201d or some variation thereof \u2014 including \u201cstronger than ever,\u201d \u201cgrowing stronger each day\u201d and \u201chopeful, prosperous and strong.\u201d Others were more creative and said the state of their state was \u201csolid,\u201d \u201crock solid,\u201d \u201cfull of opportunity\u201d or \u201cdetermined.\u201d But a few were \u2026 less confident: \u201cThe state of our state is improving\u201d (ouch, Kansas); \u201cthe state of our state is that we\u2019ve got work to do\u201d (better get cracking, Wisconsin!).\n\nLaura Bronner contributed analysis.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americas-governors-are-talking-about/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich", "Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "Which 2020 Candidates Have The Most In Common \u2026 On Twitter?", "text": "The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates use Twitter like an earlier generation of politicians may have used a soapbox: to announce policy plans, solicit donations, marshal their supporters and criticize the current administration.\n\nEach of these candidates is speaking to his or her own virtual village square. But how many people spend time in more than one village? How much overlap is there between, say, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s audience and Bernie Sanders\u2019s? And which candidates are most often associated with one another, based on their Twitter followers?\n\nTwitter isn\u2019t real life, of course; it\u2019s an often-ridiculous short-burst social network that is decidedly not representative of the electorate at large. But it\u2019s still a slice of life. The people following candidates on Twitter are those who want to receive a steady stream of information about at least part of the 2020 campaign. Understanding how that tribe operates can tell us something about an influential slice of the electorate.\n\nSo off our web-scraper went, dredging up every follower of the 20 Democratic presidential candidates who FiveThirtyEight considered \u201cmajor\u201d in early May, when we ran our script. The result was a data set with almost 20 million entries, which you can download on GitHub.\n\nThis data reveals the obvious, such as raw follower counts. It also reveals more subtle trends, such as which candidates\u2019 followers are loyal, which cast a broad net, which seem to have a similar appeal and which apparently have nothing in common.\n\nFor starters, here are the candidates ranked by the share of their followers who don\u2019t follow any other 2020 Democratic candidate.\n\nCandidates whose followers are loyal only to them Share of each 2020 candidate\u2019s followers who don\u2019t follow any other candidates Account \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nFOLLOWERS \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nExclusive FOLLOWERS \u25b2 \u25bc\n\n@marwilliamson 2,610,335 \u2013 74.8% \u2013 \u2013 @BernieSanders 9,254,423 \u2013 63.2 \u2013 \u2013 @Hickenlooper 144,816 \u2013 56.3 \u2013 \u2013 @CoryBooker 4,246,252 \u2013 52.5 \u2013 \u2013 @JoeBiden 3,558,333 \u2013 43.8 \u2013 \u2013 @AndrewYang 267,897 \u2013 43.4 \u2013 \u2013 @TulsiGabbard 349,443 \u2013 34.7 \u2013 \u2013 @BetoORourke 1,424,745 \u2013 26.5 \u2013 \u2013 @amyklobuchar 692,985 \u2013 24.0 \u2013 \u2013 @PeteButtigieg 1,033,834 \u2013 23.7 \u2013 \u2013 @SenGillibrand 1,410,303 \u2013 23.3 \u2013 \u2013 @KamalaHarris 2,640,072 \u2013 22.3 \u2013 \u2013 @JulianCastro 212,582 \u2013 21.4 \u2013 \u2013 @sethmoulton 138,450 \u2013 20.1 \u2013 \u2013 @JayInslee 51,504 \u2013 19.0 \u2013 \u2013 @ewarren 2,486,101 \u2013 16.4 \u2013 \u2013 @TimRyan 20,080 \u2013 15.6 \u2013 \u2013 @JohnDelaney 20,266 \u2013 12.9 \u2013 \u2013 @MichaelBennet 21,053 \u2013 11.7 \u2013 \u2013 @ericswalwell 84,415 \u2013 9.2 \u2013 \u2013 Among candidates who were considered \u201cmajor\u201d by FiveThirtyEight as of May 8. Follower lists for each candidate\u2019s primary accounts (according to a CSPAN Twitter list) were scraped from May 8-15, except for @Hickenlooper, which was scraped on June 6 to correct a coding error.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of the people who follow Marianne Williamson \u2014 a \u201cspiritual and inspirational author, lecturer, non-profit activist,\u201d per her Twitter bio \u2014 don\u2019t follow any other Democratic candidate, putting them in a loyalty class all their own. Similarly, of the over 9 million people who follow Bernie Sanders, almost two-thirds follow no other candidate.\n\nThe 2.5 million people who follow Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, are more gregarious \u2014 84 percent of them follow at least one of her Democratic rivals. Ditto the 2.6 million people who follow Kamala Harris, 78 percent of whom also follow another candidate.\n\nDigging a little deeper into the follower interaction information, we can find out, for example, which other candidates Warren\u2019s followers are paying attention to. The Venn diagrams below try to answer that question, showing the overlap in followers between every candidate who had more than 500,000 followers in early May.\n\nThis chart reveals relatively large intersections between followers of Sanders and Warren, who share progressive policy platforms; between followers of Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke, who are both young, male and white; and between Harris and other major female candidates such as Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nFollower overlap patterns seem to share some similarities with Democrats\u2019 vote preferences, too. Morning Consult has been tracking voters\u2019 second-choice candidates, and according to the latest poll, respondents who planned to vote for Warren said their top backup choices were Harris and Sanders. Similarly, on Twitter, 60 percent of Warren\u2019s followers also follow Sanders, and 37 percent each follow Harris and Biden \u2014 her largest overlap groups.\n\nWith some simple calculations, we can look past the sheer size of each Twitter overlap and get a sense for which pairs of candidates share some quality (ideology, Twitter skills, who knows) that makes them appeal to the same people. Theoretically, people could be following multiple presidential candidates at random, but that\u2019s not how Twitter really works \u2014 if one account speaks to my interests, I\u2019m likely to be interested in similar accounts.\n\nTo figure out which candidates are getting paired up more often than we\u2019d expect based on chance alone, we rely on a number that data miners call \u201clift,\u201d which is the ratio of how many followers a pair actually has to how many followers we\u2019d expect them to have based solely on their individual Twitter popularity. For example, say we have 100 total Twitter users, and 50 of them follow Sanders while 10 of them follow Warren. If the reasons that a person followed Sanders had nothing to do with the reasons they followed Warren, we\u2019d expect the overlap between the two to be five users. If it turns out that 10 users follow both Warren and Sanders, then we have a lift value of two (twice as many as expected), which means we can speculate that the two candidates share some quality that appeals to the same people. If only one user follows both, then we have a lift of 0.2 (one-fifth as many as expected), and we would suspect that there\u2019s something about each candidate that drives away some people who follow the other candidate.\n\nIn the chart below, candidate pairs are organized by lift value, so those above the dotted line have more followers in common than you\u2019d expect by chance while those below the line have fewer.\n\nSome of the pairs that float above the line on this chart also stood out in the Venn diagrams, such as Harris and Warren, Harris and Gillibrand and O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg. O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro also have a relatively large overlap, perhaps because they\u2019re both from Texas. The small dots at the very top capture overlaps that are tens of times larger than we\u2019d expect to see if the candidates\u2019 appeals to followers were unrelated. That\u2019s probably because users who follow one lesser-known candidate such as Michael Bennet or John Delaney are likely to be highly engaged in the race and follow the other candidates as well. For example, the average Delaney follower also follows more than six other Democratic candidates.\n\nThe chart also reveals the candidate pairs who are not followed together. Williamson appears in most of these pairs, but the combination of Sanders and Booker also sinks to the bottom; their follower overlap is about half the size of what we\u2019d expect given their individual popularity.\n\nTwitter is just one front on which the fight for the Democratic nomination is being waged, but it does provide some insight into how candidates are using social media and who is listening. Democrats are, after all, looking for a candidate who can beat President Trump, who redefined how we view Silicon Valley\u2019s little blue bird.\n\nWe want to hear how you\u2019re using this data!

Questions, comments or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nA separation-of-powers showdown has been brewing since Democrats took control of the House in January. And with two new lawsuits directly attacking House Democrats\u2019 oversight authority, President Trump is now challenging whether one of Congress\u2019s most potent checks on the executive branch can be used to probe his finances.\n\nOver the past month, several House committees have issued subpoenas to banks with ties to Trump and an accounting firm that prepared several years of his financial statements, demanding a variety of documents. Trump has already declared that the White House won\u2019t cooperate with any of the Democrats\u2019 investigations, but he has little control over whether an external organization like a bank complies with a congressional subpoena. So he sued the banks, the accounting firm and House oversight committee Chairman Elijah Cummings. Trump is asking the courts to invalidate the subpoenas and arguing that they are an illegitimate exercise of Congress\u2019s oversight power.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold \u2014 and possibly even unprecedented \u2014 argument. Several legal experts told me that this appears to be the first time a sitting president has responded to a congressional inquiry by suing a member of Congress. They predicted that the cases will likely be difficult to win in court. Instead, they said, the lawsuits\u2019 real power lies in politics and delay: They help Trump feed a political argument that House Democrats are unfairly persecuting him, while the subpoenas could be tied up in the courts for months or even years. And the ripple effects could be much bigger \u2014 if Trump successfully evades congressional scrutiny in these cases and others, future presidents could be emboldened to challenge Congress in similar ways.\n\nDemocrats are arguing that the contested subpoenas to Deutsche Bank, Capital One and Mazars USA, the accounting firm, fall squarely under their oversight powers. Congress can conduct investigations related to legislation and the functioning of the executive branch, and Democrats say they\u2019re trying to learn whether Trump or his businesses are dependent on Russian money in a way that could influence his presidential decision-making. They\u2019ve also said the banking subpoenas are part of a broader effort to determine whether the banks are helping Russian clients get money out of Russia. This wider investigation could theoretically trigger further congressional action if it reveals that the banks were involved in illicit money laundering.\n\nBut Trump is arguing that Democrats are seeking details of his private financial dealings merely to score political points and that the subpoenas to the banks violate privacy laws. In the lawsuit against Cummings and the accounting firm, Trump\u2019s lawyers say that Democrats have \u201cdeclared all-out political war\u201d against the president, with subpoenas as \u201ctheir weapons of choice,\u201d and are trying \u201cto expose [Trump\u2019s] private financial information for the sake of exposure.\u201d And in the lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One, they write that the subpoenas are intended to \u201charass\u201d Trump and \u201cferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage.\u201d\n\nThese claims of overreach might play well with Trump\u2019s base, but the case itself is a long shot, said Cornell University law professor Josh Chafetz, who studies the relationship between Congress and the executive branch. \u201cCongress has incredibly broad oversight powers, and there are any number of areas where these records could be relevant,\u201d he said.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a completely open-and-shut case, however. Lance Cole, a law professor at Penn State University and an expert on congressional investigations, said that because courts have ruled in the past that Congress can\u2019t use its power to peer into citizens\u2019 private lives without some legitimate justification, a judge might be sympathetic to Trump\u2019s argument, particularly if Democrats are asking for lots of old financial documents. However, in the 1990s, Congress probed the details of a 15-year-old real estate deal involving Bill and Hillary Clinton as part of the Whitewater investigation, dredging up personal details from long before Clinton was president. That may bolster the argument that a president can\u2019t really be compared with an ordinary citizen. \u201cYou can debate the merits of the investigation, but it\u2019s hard for Trump to say that Congress has never done this before,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t need to prevail in these cases to deal the Democrats a significant setback, however \u2014 he just needs to ensure that the lawsuits are not immediately dismissed. That\u2019s because it can take months for a case to wend its way through the judicial bureaucracy before it goes to trial, and the subpoenas will likely be put on hold until the case is resolved. \u201cIt\u2019s completely possible we won\u2019t have an answer until after the 2020 election,\u201d said Margaret Taylor, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nSo the lawsuits are likely to help Trump whether or not he ultimately wins them. In the short term, they\u2019re feeding a broader political narrative of Democratic overreach. In the medium term \u2014 possibly through the entire election cycle \u2014 they will delay Democrats\u2019 efforts to access his financial records. The million-dollar question is what the impact will be on our political system in the long term. Taylor told me that it\u2019s deeply unusual for a president to argue that he\u2019s simply not subject to congressional oversight. \u201cSince Watergate, presidents have had their disagreements with Congress, but they have recognized that Congress has a valid oversight role,\u201d she said.\n\nRegardless of what happens with Trump\u2019s finances, this fight could be a sign of things to come. \u201cIf Trump continues to stonewall and the Democrats don\u2019t push back or their pushback is ineffective, future presidents will decide that they basically aren\u2019t answerable to Congress unless they want to be,\u201d Chafetz said.\n\nOther cases\n\nPresident Trump\n\nA case alleging that Trump is unconstitutionally accepting \u201cemoluments\u201d from foreign countries will be allowed to move forward. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that congressional Democrats\u2019 definition of emolument \u2014 which broadly encompasses any gift or payment from a foreign power \u2014 is more convincing than Trump\u2019s attorneys\u2019 narrower definition of an emolument as a payment received for services performed in the president\u2019s official capacity. Another emoluments case filed by the attorneys general of D.C. and Maryland is currently pending in an appeals court, but the scope of the Democrats\u2019 lawsuit is much broader \u2014 rather than focusing on Trump\u2019s Washington, D.C., hotel, it implicates all of Trump\u2019s businesses worldwide.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nOne of the cases challenging Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs, who said they were withdrawing from the suit because the money obtained through the declaration wouldn\u2019t be used to build barriers in the places where their clients are located. Many other lawsuits involving the national emergency declaration are ongoing.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments in April on a case about whether the Trump administration can add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Many observers reported that the court\u2019s conservative majority seemed willing to allow the addition of the question.\n\nThe Department of Justice filed a brief in a case involving the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, arguing that the entire law is unconstitutional, which is a reversal of its previous position that some, but not all, of the ACA should be struck down. A federal district court judge in Texas ruled in December that the ACA is unconstitutional because a 2017 law removed the tax penalty for not having health insurance. The case is now pending appeal.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland denied the Trump administration\u2019s request to dismiss a new set of lawsuits against the travel ban to the U.S. by residents of seven countries, including several where most of the citizens are Muslim. The Supreme Court allowed the policy to take effect last summer, but the new travel ban lawsuits are challenging the legality of its design and enforcement. The judge\u2019s ruling will allow the plaintiffs to obtain evidence about how the process of administering the ban is unfolding.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration pushes back against Democrats", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-trumps-latest-lawsuits-keep-congress-from-investigating-future-presidents/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Trump Is Losing The Legal Fight Against Sanctuary Cities, But It May Still Pay Off Politically", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nOn Friday, a federal appeals court handed down another setback for President Trump\u2019s effort to crack down on sanctuary cities, a campaign pledge that he has been fighting to fulfill since his first few days in office. The judges in the case ruled that the Trump administration could not withhold federal law-enforcement funds from cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents. The ruling came down on the same day that Trump declared a national emergency to secure funding to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 another effort to fulfill a key campaign promise, and one that will almost certainly be mired in a lengthy legal process where a win is far from guaranteed.\n\nWhy is the president so willing to dig in and risk legal defeat when it comes to his signature immigration issues? It might be because without cooperation from Congress, Trump\u2019s best shot at fulfilling some of his key campaign promises is to take bold \u2014 and possibly unconstitutional \u2014 actions and hope for a victory in the courts. Even a series of losses might seem better, from a political perspective, than doing nothing. As Christopher Lasch, a law professor at the University of Denver, told me, \u201cTo the extent that he can tell his base he\u2019s trying to do something, that\u2019s a win for Trump \u2014 regardless of how the cases turn out.\u201d In the case of sanctuary cities, what\u2019s at stake is the balance of power between the federal government and state and local authorities \u2014 and so far, judges have almost uniformly sided against the federal government.\n\nFrom the beginning, Trump and his administration have been fighting an uphill battle against sanctuary cities. Judges across the country \u2014 appointed by both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 have rejected several attempts by the administration to yank federal funding from cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration-enforcement efforts, and a federal judge in California refused the administration\u2019s request to suspend the state\u2019s sanctuary laws. \u201cThey\u2019ve been roundly defeated again and again,\u201d said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University.\n\nMany of these cases revolve around a federal law that says cities and states can\u2019t forbid their employees from communicating with federal agents about the immigration status of people in their jurisdiction. An executive order issued by Trump in his first few days in office and the conditions later placed by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions on law-enforcement grants both make federal funding at least partially contingent on compliance with federal agents. But legal experts told me that it\u2019s unconstitutional for a president to try to attach these kinds of strings to funding, because Congress controls spending and therefore only Congress has the power to impose conditions on federal grants. The law itself may also be unconstitutional under the 10th Amendment, which shields states\u2019 rights. Several judges have made this point in their rulings, relying on a 2018 Supreme Court decision that was authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito and overturned a federal sports gambling law on the grounds that it was \u201ccommandeering\u201d the states to enforce federal laws.\n\nThese recent lower-court rulings may have been predictable \u2014 at least to legal experts. But the Trump administration pressed on anyway, perhaps because the success of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda partially depends on his ability to get local law enforcement to work with federal agents. It\u2019s hard for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to locate undocumented immigrants without the help of state or local police.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more cost effective and efficient for ICE to pick people up who\u2019ve already been arrested and held in the local jail than to go find them in their home or elsewhere,\u201d said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. According to a 2018 report from his organization, 69 percent of ICE arrests during the first 135 days of the Trump administration were based on transfers from the criminal-justice system. The institute also found that California\u2019s share of overall ICE arrests fell after statewide sanctuary policies were implemented, while the share of arrests rose in some other parts of the country.\n\nGiven this context, it makes sense that the Trump administration would continue to fight sanctuary cities, despite the administration\u2019s string of defeats so far. And Trump may be banking on a more favorable hearing at the Supreme Court, which ultimately upheld his ban on travel to the U.S. from a number of countries, including several where the majority of the population is Muslim, after a series of losses in the lower courts. Most of the legal experts I spoke with were skeptical, though, that the justices would be willing to take the cases involving conditions on federal grants unless the administration wins in at least one appellate court.\n\nBut if the goal is to demonstrate to Trump\u2019s base that he\u2019s working to fulfill a key campaign promise, his record in the courts may not really matter. Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which seeks to decrease immigration to the U.S., said that Trump faces significant pressure from his base to do something \u2014 anything \u2014 to fight back against sanctuary cities, which is why it could be more politically costly to back down than to continue losing. \u201cThe people who support increased immigration enforcement are very frustrated with this status quo, and they want to see the Trump administration take it as far as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd the president may simply feel that he doesn\u2019t have much to lose by continuing to fight. Taking a few more defeats on sanctuary cities won\u2019t change much right away, since the administration is already losing across the board. It\u2019s possible that if California\u2019s sanctuary law is ultimately upheld, more states will decide to pass similar legislation, but that process would take time. And by tying state and local governments up in expensive legal battles, the administration could end up deterring some smaller or less firmly Democratic cities from enacting sanctuary policies, Lasch said.\n\n\u201cEven if he keeps losing, that reinforces the narrative that the Trump administration is trying to enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws and the courts are against them,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro, director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute. Trump could be making a similar calculation about declaring a national emergency: Settling in for a series of defeats in the short term could turn out to be a successful political strategy in the long run.\n\nOther cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nA federal judge ruled that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort intentionally lied to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, in violation of his plea agreement. As a result, Manafort\u2019s plea deal is no longer in effect, which means he could spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Roger Stone is now under a limited gag order issued by the same judge after Stone went on a media blitz last month discussing his indictment and arrest as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation. Then Stone posted a picture to Instagram that included a picture of the judge\u2019s face with crosshairs in the background, prompting the judge to schedule a hearing for Thursday to discuss the conditions of his release. Stone apologized to the judge and took the image down, but she indicated that his release on bail could now be in jeopardy.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nLast spring, a judge ruled that Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked people from viewing or replying to his posts on Twitter. Trump appealed the case to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where oral arguments were recently scheduled for March 26.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nOn Friday, another case involving Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 which removes the threat of deportation from certain undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children \u2014 will be argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Last spring in the same case, a federal District Court judge ruled that Trump\u2019s reasons for revoking the program were \u201cvirtually unexplained\u201d and the revocation was therefore illegal.\n\nWilliam Barr was confirmed as attorney general on Thursday, triggering the dismissal of several challenges to acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker\u2019s appointment last November.\n\nLast Friday, Trump declared the situation on the country\u2019s southern border to be a national emergency in order to secure funds to build a long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico. On Monday, the attorneys general of 16 states sued the president, arguing that his declaration violates the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. Another lawsuit has been filed against the president by an environmental organization and several landowners in south Texas who say they\u2019ll be affected by the construction of the wall, in addition to a separate lawsuit filed by several environmental and animal rights groups. A watchdog group is also suing the Department of Justice for failing to provide records related to the president\u2019s legal authority to invoke a national emergency. All of these cases have been added to the latest update of the Trump Docket data set.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s national emergency faces legal pushback", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-losing-the-legal-fight-against-sanctuary-cities-but-it-may-still-pay-off-politically/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}]}, "fivethirtyeight_economics": {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/economics/", "articles": [{"title": "How 13 Rejected States Would Have Changed The Electoral College", "text": "How 13 Rejected States Would Have Changed The Electoral College Our state borders define our presidential elections. But what if they were different?\n\nOur perception of U.S. politics wouldn\u2019t be the same without the Electoral College. Thanks to most states\u2019 winner-take-all rules (Nebraska and Maine are the only two states that can split their votes), the Electoral College turns states into red and blue Legos. We comfortably call California a \u201cblue state\u201d even though it\u2019s home to millions of Republican voters, and we refer to Alabama as a solidly \u201cred state\u201d despite the fact that a third of its voters preferred Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nPlenty of Democrats are interested in changing that. Elizabeth Warren has called for the abolishment of the Electoral College, and a handful of states have signed on to a plan that would essentially bypass the Electoral College \u2014 members of the National Popular Vote initiative have pledged to throw their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner no matter who their state voted for, but the agreement won\u2019t kick in until the states involved have enough electoral votes to guarantee that whoever they vote for will win. But the chances of either idea getting enacted are still pretty remote.\n\nOne way to understand just how skewed the Electoral College can be is by rearranging the states inside of it. We know what would happen if the Electoral College were gone, but what would happen if it were simply different?\n\nOur current state borders are fairly arbitrary. Throughout American history, people have been proposing new states, but most don\u2019t appear on the map today, either because they once existed but were later redrawn, or because they simply never caught on. But what if some of these would-be states were around today? Would moving those state borders, without changing any votes, change our political reality?\n\nThe short answer is probably not, at least in 2016: Of the 13 maps we tested, none of them flipped the outcome of the last presidential election. These new maps did shift the Electoral College vote margin by as much as 38 votes, but since President Trump won by more than 70 votes, it wasn\u2019t enough to swing the election to Clinton.\n\nPlay around with the maps yourself to see what I mean:\n\n13 (imaginary) Electoral Colleges See what would change if these fake states existed (and all Electoral College votes were apportioned based on 2016 population) CHOOSE A FAKE STATE Absaroka Chicago Deseret New York City Franklin Jefferson Lincoln Old Massachusetts Original Virginia Pico Republic of Texas Superior Westsylvania SWITCH VIEW TO Current state boundaries 2016 MARGIN D R +10 +20 +30 +40 The state of Superior, encompassing the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and a few counties in Wisconsin, was proposed in 1897 . Superior would have had a population of 383,573 and three electoral votes in 2016. Trump would have won Superior by a 21-point margin, leaving Michigan\u2019s lower peninsula to be narrowly won by Clinton. How these maps would have voted in 2016 Electoral vote margin for each map The \u201cactual\u201d line represents what the 2016 Electoral College margin would have been if there had been no faithless electors (R+74). The \u201cCurrent state borders\u201d map above has a slightly different distribution of electoral votes because it apportions the Electoral College based on 2016 population and ignores the fact that Maine split its votes.\n\n(Please don\u2019t write in to tell me about how, if any of these states had actually come to be, our politics would be different, the butterfly effect, blah blah etc. This is a thought exercise! I ignored some other realities as well: Faithless electors and split electoral votes don\u2019t exist here, for example; all electoral tallies assume electors voted for the person who won their state. We redistributed all Electoral College votes based on 2016 population, which means some real states have more or fewer votes than they did in reality that year, when the Electoral College was based on 2010 population. Adding and removing senators also changes the total number of electors, so not all maps will add up to 538, the current total number of electors. In one map \u2014 The Republic of Texas \u2014 Texas\u2019 representatives were simply removed, dropping the total number of electors to 498. And since Americans have proposed and rejected more maps than one person can draw, I used Wikipedia and my own interest level to decide which fake states to include. If you want more details about the technical process of producing these maps, a) God bless, and b) check the methodology section below.)\n\nWhile none of those fake maps would have produced a different outcome in 2016, there is a relatively easy way to rewrite the past \u2014 if we free ourselves from the constraints of history and instead do a little strategic shuffling. By reallocating two protuberant state parts (the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the Florida Panhandle) to their neighbors (Wisconsin and Alabama, respectively), we can flip the outcome of 2016 with a single click.\n\nOne easy way to flip the election All it takes is New Wisconsin and New Alabama SWITCH VIEW TO Current state boundaries 2016 MARGIN D R +10 +20 +30 +40 How these maps would have voted in 2016 Electoral vote margin for each map The \u201cactual\u201d line represents what the 2016 Electoral College margin would have been if there had been no faithless electors (R+74).

For better or worse, we will return to the same old red-and-blue map on the next election night, and we\u2019ll simply be watching to see if any states change color. But even if the Electoral College isn\u2019t going anywhere, it\u2019s still worth remembering that nothing about our political map is inevitable.", "link": "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/electoral-college-new-states-2016-election/", "author": []}, {"title": "Can You Get Trump To 1,237?", "text": "1.

This year, like nearly every other in the past decade, the New England Patriots\u2019 refusal to regress to the mean is a central storyline.\n\nRemember back when the Patriots were 0-1 and faced a must-win in Week 2? Well, they won. Then in Week 4 they dropped to 2-2, and the end of an era was supposedly nigh. Except no. Pats will be Pats, and now they\u2019ve won their last six games en route to the best record in the AFC. That streak has included comfortable wins against the Cincinnati Bengals (who at one point projected to have the best record), the surprisingly strong Buffalo Bills, and Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck. (The Patriots are also tied with the Green Bay Packers for a league-leading point differential). And according to my colleague Neil Paine, the Patriots are really a second-half team. I shudder to think.\n\nBut there\u2019s another storyline that\u2019s dominated the exposition period: The best record in the NFL belongs to the 9-1 Arizona Cardinals. While they\u2019ve beaten some decent teams like Dallas, Philadelphia and San Francisco, they don\u2019t have what the yakkers call a \u201csignature\u201d win. They have only the seventh-best SRS in football, second to the Packers in the NFC, and only a half-point ahead of the defending champion Seattle Seahawks (who have four losses).\n\nAside from being the class of their respective conferences so far this year, the two franchises have little in common. The Cardinals have now secured their second winning season in a row \u2014 and can count that as an accomplishment in light of their 90-year history of losing. Although the Patriots\u2019 dominance of the regular season continues apace, they will likely be disappointed if they don\u2019t win their first Super Bowl in 10 years.\n\nTo illustrate just how divergent these two franchises have been, I created a chart to show the entire history of the NFL (or at least what we have stats for). This is the cumulative regular-season point differential since 1920, for all teams (with the Patriots and the Cardinals highlighted):\n\nThe current Patriots dynasty is lengthy and steep, and belongs in the same group as the San Francisco 49ers of the 1980s, the Cleveland Browns of the \u201950s and \u201960s, or the Chicago Bears of the \u201930s and \u201940s (especially when you factor in league parity).\n\nThat chart is fun, but it would be a lot more useful if we could make out all 81 NFL franchises individually. Well \u2026\n\nChart of the week\n\nThanks to the great work of designated Skeptical Football charts guru Reuben Fischer-Baum, you can do just that. Roll over a line to see the team\u2019s entire history, and move along the line to see exactly how many points it has scored compared to its opponents at a given point. You can also click on a team to keep its line highlighted, and then roll over another team for comparison. Irrelevant dates (where no regular-season games were played) are excluded from the timeline.\n\nHere are a couple of things I found from the interactive that I thought were interesting:\n\nEven more Aaron Rodgers\n\nFirst, Aaron Rodgers \u2014 apparently unmoved by my ongoing criticism of his failure to throw more interceptions \u2014 is absolutely tearing it up this year (at least when his team is ahead, which is most of the time lately). Recently, he accomplished something pretty cool that I didn\u2019t know about:\n\nOn Sept. 25, 2011, Rodgers threw three touchdown passes as the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears 27-17. With that result, the Packers had scored 2,991 more points than their opponents all-time, ahead of the Bears\u2019 2,989 \u2014 and the Packers haven\u2019t looked back. As of last Sunday, Green Bay held the NFL\u2019s best historical margin of victory by 358 points.\n\nComment of the week\n\nLast week Neil Paine and I wrote an article titled \u201cRandy Moss May Well Have Been The Greatest Receiver Of All Time\u201d \u2014 which focused on the insane \u201cWith Or Without You\u201d stats that Moss put up in his career. In the discussion, we raised the possibility that if receivers can have as much of an impact as Randy Moss appeared to have, that may cast doubt on some previous knowledge \u2014 like how good of a quarterback Joe Montana was considering he had Jerry Rice running routes for so long.\n\nA few different people in the comments and elsewhere raised the point that Joe Montana had already won two Super Bowls before Jerry Rice arrived in San Francisco:\n\nUpon further consideration, I\u2019m inclined to agree that it\u2019s fairly unlikely that Rice was the driving force behind the 49ers\u2019 success. But I\u2019m not so sure Montana was either.\n\nWinning in the NFL can happen for a lot of different reasons \u2014 a star quarterback (think Peyton Manning), a successful new offensive or defensive strategy (think West Coast offense, zone blitz, or, more recently, the Wildcat), or a standout player who creates mismatches that other teams struggle with (think Randy Moss). But the effects of various win-generating phenomena can come in a lot of shapes and sizes.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s compare the 49ers to the St. Louis Rams. Pay particular attention to the \u201cGreatest Show on Turf\u201d era from 1999 into the early 2000s:\n\nThe \u201cGreatest Show on Turf\u201d Rams had a few different things going for them, but their success was sudden, rocky, and lasted only a few years. They \u201cbroke the game\u201d for a while in the sense that they were something the rest of the NFL didn\u2019t know how to deal with. But despite having a lasting effect on how football is played, their dominance was fragile.\n\nOn the other hand, from the early \u201980s to the late \u201990s, the 49ers outscored their opponents by around 2,500 points \u2014 by far the most dominant stretch in the Super Bowl era. And they did it with a practically straight line, meaning they were better than their opposition by a nearly constant amount.\n\nIf the 49ers owed a significant part of their success to any one player (or phenomenon of any kind), we\u2019d likely see more variety in the team\u2019s arc as that player\u2019s performance fluctuated, or as he was injured, or left. But the consistency of the 49ers\u2019 ascension suggests they were more of an organization-driven phenomenon. At the very least, it implies that they were the sum of many different quality parts.\n\nPlaying around with the interactive, I\u2019m fascinated by how different phenomena manifest. For example: How do the impacts of offensive and defensive innovation compare? What are the effects of a quarterback versus those of a coach? There are a lot of possibilities, so let us know what you uncover in the comments or on Twitter.\n\nWeek 11 kicking awards\n\nI keep thinking (and my editor keeps hoping) this will be the week I won\u2019t bother talking about kickers, but then Las Vegas Locomotives alumnus Graham Gano has to go and attempt a 63-yard field goal with one second left in a thriller between the Carolina Panthers and the Atlanta Falcons. Unfortunately for the Panthers, it was blocked.\n\nMy kicking model suggests that a kicker in 2014 should typically be able to make a 63-yard field goal around 40 percent of the time \u2014 but this may be skewed by the fact that such long kicks are so rarely attempted. Still, Gano\u2019s 63-yarder wasn\u2019t what earned him the \u201ckicker loss\u201d and Week 11\u2019s Least Valuable Kicker award. What did him in was his previous miss, a 46-yarder, which a 2014 NFL kicker should typically make about 77 percent of the time.\n\nMy algorithm picked the Falcons\u2019 Matt Bryant as the MVK over the St. Louis Rams\u2019 Greg Zeurlein (who had an excellent week, going 5/5 with two 50+ yarders in the Rams\u2019 huge upset of the Broncos), on account of Bryant making four field goals in a game his team only won by two (though none was over 44 yards).\n\nBut the biggest news of the week is that with Nick Novak missing a kick for the San Diego Chargers, we\u2019re down to just two perfect kickers, and they\u2019re both veterans: the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 Adam Vinatieri and the New York Giants\u2019 Josh Brown.\n\nGunslinger of the week\n\nThere were 26 interceptions thrown in Week 11, and seven of them were thrown by the Manning brothers. Eli Manning had five in the Giants\u2019 narrow loss against the 49ers \u2014 four of which were thrown with his team trailing \u2014 enough to win him our Gunslinger of the Week award.\n\nThrowing a practically embarrassing number of interceptions now and then is something great quarterbacks do. QBs, don\u2019t be ashamed of looking bad when trying to win! A loss is a loss, whether you throw zero interceptions or six. My maxim is: If a quarterback loses a game without throwing a few interceptions, he probably didn\u2019t try hard enough.\n\nIn general, Eli Manning is a bit of an unknown. He puts up fairly big totals for a mediocre team, but often gets criticized for his high interception rate. Yet his win curve looks mostly like his big brother\u2019s, only flatter, and it\u2019s plausible that his shame-free style was partially responsible for the Giants\u2019 shocking wins in two Super Bowls. Eli\u2019s gambling wouldn\u2019t necessarily make the Giants favorites against stronger competition, but it might have given them a better chance against a team like the 2007 Patriots than a better team with a quarterback who took fewer risks.\n\nJust for fun, I looked at the Pro Football Reference list of quarterbacks with the most four-plus-interception games. The top four are George Blanda, Joe Namath, Ken Stabler and Terry Bradshaw (all of whom won championships, and three of whom are in the Hall of Fame). Of the top 50 such QBs, 15 have won championships (and account for 20 Super Bowls), including both brothers Manning.\n\nRookie QB watch\n\nThe biggest news in rookie QB-land was in Tennessee, where sixth-round-pick Zach Mettenberger had a fairly strong game against the Pittsburgh Steelers (263 yards and two touchdowns). He\u2019s now guaranteed to reach the magical four-start line when rookie QBs are more likely to have successful careers. I\u2019m not quite ready to move him up in the rankings just yet, but every pass he completes is one more than Johnny Manziel has completed all year. As of now, I\u2019d order the rookies\u2019 estimated career prospects like so:\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 Blake Bortles had a bye week. The Oakland Raiders\u2019 Derek Carr, despite finally winning a game Thursday night (in dramatic fashion) has had a pretty weak couple of weeks, with just 172 and 174 yards in Weeks 11 and 12, despite a combined 69 pass attempts. The Minnesota Vikings\u2019 Teddy Bridgewater\u2019s two game winning streak came to an end in Chicago. Mettenberger. The Patriots\u2019 Jimmy Garropolo. Manziel once again got all dressed up with no ball to throw.\n\nNot really in the game yet but worth keeping an eye on: Logan Thomas is now second on the depth chart in Arizona. So far this year he has a 108.9 NFL Passer Rating, but he\u2019s gotten it the hard way: He has only one completion in eight attempts (10 if you count sacks), but it went for 81 yards and a touchdown.\n\nReader response\n\nIn Week 9\u2019s column, I introduced my experimental \u201cwin curves\u201d for quarterbacks, which depict how much each QB typically wins relative to various expectations, and I included a number of examples.\n\nI covered most popular quarterbacks, with a couple of notable exceptions. One request I got an awful lot:\n\n@skepticalsports As a Bears fan, I'd love to see the \"Win Curve\" for Jay Cutler that you wrote about in your latest @FiveThirtyEight column \u2014 John D. Kos (@johndkos) November 7, 2014\n\nI would have included Cutler initially, but I had a \u201cproblem\u201d with his curve: It was coming out as a perfectly straight line, virtually indistinguishable from the y=x guide (a highly unlikely outcome). I thought this might have been a data problem, but it turns out Cutler\u2019s results really were just too vanilla for the method I was using to pick up the variation. So I tried an alternate method that is more sensitive to small variation. The alternate method turned out to be less sensitive to large variation as well, so I was able to plot a couple more notable quarterbacks as well as Cutler:\n\nRussell Wilson \u2014 like his comrade Andrew Luck \u2014 has a very impressive curve so far in his career, albeit over a sample still probably too small for this analysis. (He also gets very good support from a strong team around him.)\n\nCutler\u2019s curve is still remarkably unremarkable, but at least it shows up. He appears to do slightly above average regardless of the circumstances. As a special treat for Bears fans who had to wait two weeks \u2014 and because I wanted to see what was going into this virtually straight line \u2014 I\u2019ve broken down Cutler\u2019s curve by quarter, and compared each to the same breakdown for Peyton Manning (our standard-bearer for such things):\n\nBeing very far ahead or behind in the first quarter is rare, so you should take the tails of that quadrant with a grain of salt. In the second and fourth quarters, Cutler seems to outperform average in a pretty uniform way, and in the third-quarter he has a bit of a reverse-Matthew Stafford thing going on.\n\nMost empirically significant game of this week\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 matchup against the defending champion Seahawks is a pretty big test for the team with the league\u2019s best record.\n\nBut on top of that, the Cardinals have a lot of important parts coming and going, which is always empirically significant: Their top QB (Carson Palmer) is out. Last week, Cardinals backup Drew Stanton held off the Detroit Lions\u2019 Stafford at the end of the game, but the Cardinals still struggled. Leading for most of the game, they rushed 26 times, but gained only 46 yards. And their top receiver, Larry Fitzgerald, is injured but may play anyway. As demonstrated in the article on Moss, the value of top-notch WRs can affect our broader understanding of the game.\n\nAnd then there are the Seahawks \u2014 who were young powerhouses last year, but are possibly already in decline \u2014 and Russell Wilson, who last year averaged 33.7 yards rushing per game. That\u2019s by far the most of any QB in a year his team won the Super Bowl \u2014 and he\u2019s averaging 57.1 per game this year. What \u201crunning\u201d quarterbacks mean for the game is a fascinating open question. A lot of newer, fancier QB-rating systems are giving QBs a lot of credit for their scrambling (often much more than if you treated those plays the same as completed pass attempts). But while those individual plays can be valuable, there haven\u2019t been a lot of dynamic offenses built around running QBs, and it\u2019s still unclear whether this is just a bonus skill or whether it will be a necessity in the future NFL.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps even more valuable to see Wilson in action with the Seahawks struggling a bit (it can also be harder to isolate an individual player\u2019s contributions when a team is firing on all cylinders). He\u2019ll be tested against a Cardinals defense that grades out as one of the best in the NFL this year \u2014 a perfect opportunity to see what both are made of.\n\nReminder: If you tweet questions to me @skepticalsports, there is a non-zero chance that I\u2019ll answer them here.\n\nCharts by Reuben Fischer-Baum.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/skeptical-football-patriots-vs-cardinals-and-an-interactive-history-of-the-nfl/", "author": ["Benjamin Morris"]}, {"title": "The Playoff Implications Of Every Game For Every NFL Team", "text": "\u201cPlayoff Implications\u201d is a phrase you usually don\u2019t hear until the final weeks of the NFL regular season, but almost every regular season game has playoff implications. In the early going, however, it can be difficult to figure out just what those implications are, and how much is riding on each game.\n\nMost other major sports leagues play a greater number of regular season games, and thus the playoff picture in those sports evolves in a more incremental fashion. The pace can seem glacial at times for MLB, and inevitable and foregone when it comes to the NBA. But with just 16 regular season games, the NFL\u2019s playoff landscape can change dramatically over the course of a single Sunday afternoon. And these tectonic shifts take place throughout the season, not just in those final weeks of December.\n\nWith a week or two left in the season, the \u201ceye test\u201d usually suffices for judging which games will shape the playoff picture. But in mid-October there are far too many possibilities for the unassisted human mind to make sense of. We can only speak in general terms. For example, we know the playoff chances for the New Orleans Saints will improve with a victory this Sunday over the Detroit Lions. But by how much? And how far would they drop with a loss? Expanding our focus, what other teams have a vested interest in the outcome of this game? One would expect Carolina\u2019s playoff chances to improve with a Saints loss, given that the Saints are their division rival. But once again, by how much?\n\nTo answer these questions, we\u2019ve created a weekly feature that measures the playoff implications of each game. To do this, you need to be able to simulate the remainder of the season multiple times and analyze the results. And in order to simulate the season, you need a way to rank all 32 teams, and use that ranking to create outcome probabilities for future games. We\u2019ve been doing just that with FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Elo rankings. But the Elo ratings, simple and beautiful, aren\u2019t the only word on NFL rankings. For this feature we\u2019re going to turn to the wisdom of the crowd instead, and use a ranking system one of the authors developed based on betting markets. In stock market terms, think of it as technical analysis in lieu of fundamental analysis.\n\nWe\u2019ll get into the methodology in a moment but first the results. Think of each interactive table below as a playoff implications \u201ccheat sheet\u201d for this week\u2019s upcoming games. (If you hover over a colored square, you\u2019ll see details for that game.)\n\n: The interactive tables above have been updated to include Thursday night\u2019s game, which now shows no playoff implications because its result is included in the playoff chances (the text of the article has not been updated).\n\nReading the table across tells you which teams are affected by any particular game. Reading the table down tells you which games matter most to any given team. For example, if you\u2019re a Texans fan, what games should you care about this week, how much should you care about them, and who do you want to win? The column headers are sortable, so clicking on the \u201cHOU\u201d column tells you to care about HOU @ PIT, ATL @ BAL, CIN @ IND, NYJ @ NE, CLE @ JAC, and KC @ SD \u2014 in that order. And you want the Texans, Falcons, Bengals, Jets, Jaguars and Chiefs to win.\n\nMy rankings start from the assumption that the NFL gambling market is efficient, and then attempts to determine how that efficient market ranks each of the 32 NFL teams. Unfortunately, Vegas doesn\u2019t actually share its rankings with the general public, but with a little reverse-engineering, we can arrive at a pretty good guess at what they are. We start with the point spread. For Thursday night\u2019s game, the New England Patriots are a 9.5-point favorite at home against the New York Jets. Since home field advantage is worth about 2.5 points, the market thinks the Patriots are 7 points better than the Jets when playing on a neutral field.\n\nArmed with this interpretation, we then take the point spreads from each game and for multiple weeks and run a simple linear regression to arrive at a consensus ranking. The process is akin to drawing a map of the United States but nobody tells you a city\u2019s location. Instead, they only tell you how far away each city is from another city (e.g. Los Angeles is 1,700 miles away from Chicago, Chicago is 165 miles from Indianapolis, and so on). To further complicate matters, our map \u201cmoves\u201d over time, making earlier \u201cdistance\u201d measurements less reliable. For example, the Steelers opened the season as a 6-point favorite at home against the Browns. If the market were to set that point spread today, Pittsburgh would most likely drop to just a 2.5-point favorite, as the Steelers have fallen short of preseason expectations, and the Browns have exceeded them. So, the ranking methodology gives more weight to recent point spread data in an attempt to get the most up-to-date market evaluation of each team.\n\nNow that we have a ranking system that assigns a probability to each future regular season game outcome, the next step is to simulate the season multiple times (50,000 times to be exact). After simulating win/loss records, we apply the NFL playoff seeding rules (plus tiebreakers) and summarize the results. There are already several sites that do these types of simulations for the purpose of producing team playoff odds (including FiveThirtyEight). For this feature, we\u2019re going to go a bit deeper than that.\n\nInstead of focusing on each team\u2019s overall playoff odds, let\u2019s instead focus on each game. We\u2019ll use the New Orleans-Detroit game as an example. Of the 50,000 simulation runs, there were precisely 30,180 (or about 60 percent) that resulted in a Lions victory, and 19,820 that resulted in a Saints victory. Let\u2019s now focus on those two samples in isolation. Of the 30,180 simulations in which the Saints lost, they made the playoffs 8,273 times, or 27 percent. Of the 19,820 simulations in which the Saints won, they made the playoffs 9,172 times, or 46 percent.

It\u2019s Much Easier To Get In Wealthier, Whiter Neighborhoods", "text": "Want A COVID-19 Test? It\u2019s Much Easier To Get In Wealthier, Whiter Neighborhoods But the disease is hitting Black and Hispanic communities hardest.\n\nWhen the coronavirus outbreak threatened to rock Philadelphia\u2019s predominantly Black neighborhoods, Dr. Ala Stanford knew that access to COVID-19 tests was going to be a problem.\n\nSo she rented a van, loaded it up and headed to the areas of the city where residents needed tests the most. Every test conducted was free.\n\nWhen Stanford began distributing tests in early April, she saw only a handful of testing centers in the city. Only a small share were in majority-Black neighborhoods, and the bar for actually getting a test was high.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been to locations that are predominantly African American where everyone had insurance and they couldn\u2019t get tested,\u201d said Stanford, referring to the often strict requirements providers had of those seeking tests as the outbreak began, such as doctor referrals, appointments and symptoms consistent with infection.\n\nStanford, a pediatric surgeon, quickly assembled a group of doctors and volunteers called the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium to help meet the challenge of testing the city\u2019s underserved residents. Together, the group has issued Philadelphia\u2019s residents more than 7,000 tests. But even with the intervention of medical professionals like Stanford stepping in to meet the rising demand, many communities of color across the country still face a dire situation in terms of getting a COVID-19 test.\n\nWith nearly 4 million coronavirus cases across the United States and hospitalizations surging in different parts of the country, there continues to be a growing demand for tests. Today, Americans routinely wait for hours to get an exam \u2014 if they can get one at all. Access is not available equally nationwide. Simply put, where Americans live and how much income they earn can still determine the ease with which they get a COVID-19 test.\n\nAccording to a new, extensive review of testing sites by ABC News, FiveThirtyEight and ABC-owned television stations, sites in communities of color in many major cities face higher demand than sites in whiter or wealthier areas in those same cities. The result of this disparity is clear: Black and Hispanic people are more likely to experience longer wait times and understaffed testing centers.\n\nThis nationwide review is one of the first to look at testing site locations coast to coast, in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., using data provided by the health care navigation company Castlight Health (the same data that Google Maps uses to surface COVID-19 testing sites). An assessment of city and state health department websites also revealed, over and over, fewer testing sites in areas primarily inhabited by racial minorities.\n\nImportantly, our analysis does not factor in the capacity of testing sites, which can vary from just 50 tests at one site to 2,000 at another, meaning that one site might be equipped to serve a larger number of people than another site. Instead, it looks at the potential demand for each site based on the number of people and sites nearby. The data we used is also less likely to reflect tests done in private physicians\u2019 offices than federally-funded community sites, local government-run mobile pop-up sites, urgent care clinics and hospitals. Additionally, this analysis doesn\u2019t take into account other factors that could determine testing accessibility, such as staffing and wait times, as well as other restrictions on testing like appointment or insurance requirements.\n\nWhen the outbreak began, testing posed the most immediate challenge to states, as a shortage of supplies, testing kits and processing backlogs created capacity problems. Since then, states have vastly increased their bandwidth to perform tests, but even now, experts from the Harvard Global Health Institute say daily testing needs to nearly double to help mitigate the pandemic. And states and cities are still struggling to determine how to allocate testing resources and where to place testing centers.\n\nThe Trump administration struggled early on in the pandemic to expand testing nationwide. Reliant on off-shore manufacturing that limited access to supplies like swabs and reagents, and armed with little data about who was getting sick and where, Trump\u2019s political appointees quickly embraced that the federal government\u2019s job would be mostly managing the logistics of testing such as supplies and distribution of state funds, as opposed to overseeing the coordination of state testing plans.\n\nBut critics say that strategy left many states scrambling to meet the rising demand that health experts say will only grow more urgent in the fall, when students return and flu season starts.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recently released a comprehensive strategy to address the disparate access to COVID-19 testing, including expanding testing at federally qualified health centers as well as supporting public-private partnerships that establish testing at retail pharmacy companies to accelerate testing within vulnerable populations. CVS and Walgreens \u2014 two of the retail pharmacies listed in the HHS plan \u2014 both said in statements to ABC News that more than half of their store locations issuing COVID-19 tests are now located in areas most in need, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s social vulnerability index.\n\nWHAT OUR ANALYSIS FOUND\n\nThe novel coronavirus itself does not distinguish between Black and white Americans. But virtually every other aspect of U.S. society does, including the nation\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nOur analysis revealed that, in many cities, testing sites in and near predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods are likely to serve far more patients than those near predominantly white areas.\n\nA similar disparity exists between richer and poorer neighborhoods, our analysis showed: Testing resources were more scarce in poorer areas, with fewer sites per person and sites located farther away. And the disparity could be even greater in real life, considering wealthier people could also get tested by private practitioners who are less likely to be reflected in our analysis.\n\nKevin Ahmaad Jenkins, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics who has been researching the impact of COVID-19 testing center availability on communities of color, told ABC News and FiveThirtyEight that his team found that testing sites serving minority communities in big cities are fewer in number, have longer lines and often run out of tests. The impact of such disparities, he said, is evident in the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate effect on people of color.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just as clear as George Floyd\u2019s video. These numbers are right in front us: We are dying at disproportionate rates,\u201d he said.\n\nTo better understand the extent of this problem, we looked for cities whose broader \u201curbanized area\u201d had at least 1 million residents. (\u201cUrbanized area\u201d is a census designation for cities and the densely populated areas immediately surrounding them.) We then calculated the potential level of demand at each testing site in that area, based on the number of people living nearby and additional sites in the area.\n\nWe assumed that people would want to get tested at nearby sites, so we compared the number of patients a site would serve if the population of each census block group tried to visit sites that were close to them. This value, which we will refer to as potential patient demand, reflects how many people live near a given site and how many other options those people have.\n\nThe disparities we found varied in severity across the country. In some major urbanized areas, they\u2019re small or nonexistent. But in others \u2014 from Dallas to Miami to San Diego and many places in between \u2014 majority-Black and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods faced far more competition for COVID-19 testing than their white neighbors. Disparities were also seen in some predominantly Asian or Pacific Islander communities, such as those in Washington, D.C., Minneapolis and Riverside, Calif., but they weren\u2019t as widespread as those among Black and Hispanic communities.\n\nAnd our calculation of potential demand for testing at some sites in those underserved neighborhoods is likely an underestimation: Based on our reporting, many of the testing sites in those neighborhoods are government-funded community sites. These sites are set up to close the gaps in testing access in different communities, but they tend to be very popular among people from all across the county or urban area because they are often free and don\u2019t require an appointment.\n\nWe used data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2014-18 American Community Survey five-year estimates to figure out if, within urbanized areas, block groups that were majority Black or majority Hispanic were more likely to be close to sites with higher potential patient demand than majority-white block groups. To compare neighborhoods, we created a measure that we call potential community need, which is an average of the potential demand at nearby test sites. We also examined how block groups with a median income in the top 25 percent compared to those with median incomes in the bottom 25 percent.\n\nCastlight\u2019s set of testing site locations is among the most comprehensive data available, but compiling every testing location in the nation is a massive undertaking, as sites are constantly opening, closing and moving. Given that, the data set is likely missing some testing sites. Additionally, our analysis is based on testing site data as of June 18, so many new sites have been added nationwide since then \u2014 and others have likely closed or moved. We conducted separate analyses using a different source of testing site locations and examined other testing-related data to corroborate our findings.\n\nWe\u2019ve highlighted some of the cities with the most emblematic trends below. While we\u2019re confident in the trends we\u2019re presenting, we\u2019d encourage you to think of them more as estimates (akin to a fire marshal\u2019s approximation of the size of a crowd at a political rally) than exact measurements (such as a baseball player\u2019s batting average). For more detail on our methodology, and some of the limitations in the data and thus this analysis, see here.\n\nHowever, this analysis still provides a vivid snapshot of the hurdles, complications and shortfalls in American efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 this summer, a time when increased testing capacity in minority and low-income areas could have slowed the disease \u2014 a point widely acknowledged by public health experts.\n\n\u201cTesting site distribution and capacity is a direct reflection of the inequalities in our existing health care system,\u201d said John Brownstein, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard Medical School whose team of researchers at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital\u2019s Computational Epidemiology Lab also looked into the health care disparities underlying geographic access to testing. \u201cThe lack of access for those most vulnerable to infections will only serve to intensify the impact of this pandemic.\u201d\n\nTEXAS\n\nKenneth Hamilton, 31, had been waiting for four hours in the line to take a COVID-19 test at Houston\u2019s NRG Stadium.\n\nEventually, after spotting several people not wearing masks or practicing social distancing, Hamilton \u2014 a small business owner and father of seven \u2014 decided that continuing to wait wasn\u2019t worth the risk of being exposed to coronavirus in the line itself. So he left, and looked for other testing options in his neighborhood.\n\nBut as a Black resident of Houston\u2019s Third Ward, the line Hamilton left was, at the time, his only nearby option. Three months after he first sought a test, he says there are considerably more testing centers in his neighborhood.\n\n\u201cOne of the schools that my kids go to, and one of the schools close by in the neighborhood, and a couple of churches now have them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey ramped up, to an extent.\u201d\n\nThe Houston urbanized area is just as diverse as many other major Texas metropolitan areas, but the city\u2019s initial plans to spread testing centers out equally across its neighborhoods while still operating at capacity helped to reduce site demand. As a result, the community demands of various neighborhoods were fairly equal. ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis showed that, on average, predominantly Black Houston neighborhoods faced similar levels of potential need as white neighborhoods. Hispanic neighborhoods had slightly higher potential community need than white neighborhoods, but not by much.\n\nBut the disparities are still clearly visible in the San Antonio and Dallas areas.\n\nSAN ANTONIO\n\nIn the San Antonio urbanized area, testing sites in poorer, majority-Black and majority-Hispanic neighborhoods in the south, east and west are estimated to have to serve far more people than sites in more affluent, whiter neighborhoods in the north, resulting in a disparity in potential community need.\n\nAccording to our analysis, of the roughly 45 sites that were actively testing in San Antonio in mid-June, several sites with the lowest potential patient demand were concentrated in the northern neighborhoods of Stone Oak and The Dominion, as well as the areas surrounding Friedrich Wilderness Park, which are all majority-white communities that boast median household incomes ranging from around $100,000 to $150,000.\n\nIn comparison, many of the busiest sites are scattered in San Antonio\u2019s more densely populated downtown, where the median income ranged from just $15,000 to about $40,000.\n\nThroughout the San Antonio urbanized area, predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods had an average potential community need twice as large as white neighborhoods; the disparity in between majority-Black and majority-white neighborhoods was even larger.\n\nExperts say that the disparity can be attributed to a long-standing gap in the health care system and an unequal distribution of health care facilities in the San Antonio area, which is one of the most economically segregated cities in the country.\n\nRecognizing testing disparities in different communities, the city identified underserved neighborhoods based on its equity matrix, and put together three cost-free pop-up sites that rotate around different parts of the city every week, according to its health department.\n\nNot only are government sites falling short of their ability to meet the public need for tests, but they themselves have become part of the disparity by concentrating demand even as they seek to address it in underserved neighborhoods. San Antonio\u2019s walk-up sites do not require a doctor\u2019s referral and, as a result, have become massively popular among those who do not otherwise have access to testing.\n\nIn late June, Jennifer Herriott, the deputy director of the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District, told us that people have lined up hours before these pop-up sites even open and that one time they had to turn down 275 people after running out of tests.\n\nHerriott said that as the demand for testing spiked, with cases and hospitalization rates across the state setting new records on an almost daily basis, the city and the county have been working to ramp up testing capacity. The pop-up sites that used to run only three days a week now operate six days a week, and each site\u2019s capacity has been increased from about 150-200 tests per day to 350.\n\nStill, the long lines remain in some places, and sites continue to run out of tests.\n\n\u201cPublic health and our partnership with San Antonio Fire [Department] has consistently had its eye on making sure that we\u2019re serving our Black and brown communities,\u201d Herriott said. \u201cAs our needs increase here, we\u2019ve increased free testing and those walk-ups and the Freeman drive-thru so we make sure that communities that might not be able to access testing are able to access testing.\u201d\n\nDALLAS\n\nDallas County and Tarrant County, two counties of nearly 4.7 million people that cover much of the Dallas urbanized area, have together reported over 64,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus so far. Our data showed that in early summer, the testing infrastructure of the Dallas urbanized area \u2014 which encompasses the cities of Dallas, Fort Worth and Arlington \u2014 resembled that of San Antonio: Local and state providers, as well as private hospitals, favored people living in whiter and wealthier parts of the county, towards the north, more than those living in the less affluent areas in the south.\n\nAcross the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth\u2013Arlington urbanized area, our analysis found that majority-Black neighborhoods had a potential community need 46 percent higher than majority-white neighborhoods; majority-Hispanic neighborhoods had a potential need 24 percent higher.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a compounding problem beyond just where the sites are,\u201d said Judge Clay Jenkins, the chief elected official in Dallas County. \u201cThe people that tend to have insurance are in the north and those that tend to not have insurance are in the south. We\u2019ve planned to put the majority of our testing in places where there\u2019s high uninsured.\u201d\n\nTake the University Park neighborhood of Dallas, where the median household income is $214,000 and almost 90 percent of the residents are white. It has at least five testing sites around the neighborhood, according to Castlight data. Appointments are required at most of them, per Castlight, which helps organize the speed at which people are able to get tested every day (walk-in testing centers tend to have longer lines).\n\nIt\u2019s a vastly different situation in Lancaster in southeast Dallas County, which has about 15,000 more residents than University Park but where Black people make up 69 percent of the population and the median household income is $53,000. Residents hoping to get a coronavirus test in the Lancaster area had to travel at least seven miles to the nearest drive-thru testing center until recently, when a nearby Walmart Supercenter opened up a drive-thru site.\n\nTo address the disparities, the city of Dallas asked the private sector to step up its support in the areas of the city most in need of more testing.\n\n\u201cA lot of the private providers are set up in northern Dallas, and it does highlight the existing disparities in the city,\u201d said Tristan Hallman, a spokesman for Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson. \u201cIn response, we\u2019ve asked Walgreens, CVS, Kroger to locate their facilities in southern Dallas, and they\u2019ve done so.\u201d\n\nIndeed, public health experts said the issue of unequal access to testing is a direct result of long-standing decisions made by private-sector companies and entrepreneurs when selecting which neighborhoods to open new businesses in. And the disparity is exacerbated by the fact that underserved communities are less likely to have the health insurance or financial resources necessary to seek costly testing from private providers when community sites are not accessible.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly driven by systematic health care injustice and it\u2019s actually very clearly delineated in Dallas because of gentrification and all of the social aspects of our community,\u201d said Katelyn Jetelina, a professor at the UTHealth School of Public Health in Dallas. \u201cWe need to figure out how to supplement the cost so that families in south Dallas don\u2019t have to decide whether they\u2019re having dinner or have to go get a COVID test.\u201d\n\nEven as more testing sites have been set up in underserved communities, new coronavirus hot spots flared up over the summer as communities began to reopen; now, a lack of tests and long lines have created major problems all over the country.\n\nFurther south, along the border in Hidalgo, Texas, Isaac Garza waited 10 hours in line to get a coronavirus test after visiting several recently reopened restaurants he oversees. As he has diabetes, an underlying condition, he didn\u2019t want to take any chances, and was relieved when his test results came back negative.\n\nBut the limited testing options in his community creates problems for Garza\u2019s staff, too. Every day, Garza said, he receives calls from employees showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 who tell him that they might have to miss critical work hours to wait in line for a test.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been challenging to do business and just to live day in and day out with all this because you\u2019re trying to protect your family, you\u2019re trying to protect your employees,\u201d he said.\n\nPHILADELPHIA\n\nFuneral director John Price, 72, had just gotten a break after a long day picking up bodies of COVID-19 victims from local hospitals in June. So he thought it was the perfect time to get tested himself for the coronavirus.\n\nPrice pulled his car into a line of approximately 300 others waiting for a test at a church parking lot on Cheltenham Avenue in North Philadelphia. Two hours in, he started getting calls from clients who had just lost loved ones to COVID-19. Another hour into his attempt to get a test, Price realized that he just couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\n\n\u201cI had to pull out of the line, because I had people who were calling me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was probably going to be another two or three hours before they got to me. If they got to me.\u201d\n\nHe went another week without getting a COVID-19 test until he stumbled upon a walk-in testing site organized by Dr. Ala Stanford\u2019s Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, which was offering the tests for free.\n\n\u201cA lot of people weren\u2019t notified of how they can actually get testing,\u201d said Price, recalling confusion amongst residents when the outbreak first began in the predominantly Black neighborhood of West Powelton, where his funeral home is based. \u201cIt was more like word of mouth, \u2018Oh this organization is doing it today over here, or so-and-so is doing it today over there.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven today, as the coronavirus crisis intensifies nationally, predominantly Black neighborhoods in the Philadelphia urbanized area, which extends into New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland, have fewer testing centers than their wealthier and whiter counterparts.\n\nOther researchers, conducting independent analyses of other data, observed the same phenomenon we did regarding the demands placed on testing sites in majority-white and majority-Black neighborhoods at the city level, despite the fact that Black Philadelphians make up a plurality of COVID-19 test recipients in the city.\n\nDrawing on his own study of access to COVID-19 tests in various Philadelphia neighborhoods, which he has been tracking since the outbreak began, Drexel University epidemiologist Dr. Usama Bilal found that testing disparities are often a product of existing systemic inequalities. Rates of testing, he said, were lower in poorer areas and areas with higher proportions of residents who are racial minorities. Testing access improved throughout the city in April and May, Bilal found, but as cases start to resurface and the demand for tests rises, he worries the city will backslide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been observing that testing access is going the wrong way again,\u201d he said. \u201cTesting is becoming more concentrated in wealthier areas in Philadelphia, and we have observed a similar pattern in Chicago and New York.\u201d\n\nA Philadelphia public health department spokesman denied that testing is increasingly inaccessible to racial minorities and said that the city has been focused on expanding resources in underserved communities, citing services like the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, which recently received city funding to conduct free coronavirus tests.\n\nBut Stanford, the surgeon who heads the consortium, said she worried that as the demand for testing increases nationwide, the share of tests she will be able to offer free of charge will fall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re out here in the sun, in the rain, doing whatever we can do in a mobile unit begging for supplies from everywhere else in the United States, waiting 10 days to get our results back,\u201d she said. \u201cBut yet, in some of the best hospitals in the nation you have an in-house test that the residents of this city do not uniformly have access to. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nAccording to the city\u2019s public health department, Philadelphia has conducted more than 166,000 COVID-19 tests. Black residents account for 40 percent of the city\u2019s COVID-19 tests, more than any other racial group tested and about equal to the share of Philadelphia that is Black, per city data.\n\nBilal\u2019s research, however, now finds that in predominantly Black and highly populated areas like the Oxford Circle neighborhood of Philadelphia, where the median household income is $41,000, just 60.9 per every 1,000 people are now getting tested. Compare that to the more affluent and plurality white Center City neighborhoods, where testing rates are now 133 per every 1,000 people, according to Bilal.\n\n\u201cThe epidemic that we really need to control long term is social inequality,\u201d said Bilal as the coronavirus outbreak in Philadelphia first took hold. \u201cIt has many different intersecting axes. So there is racism: that is places, that is classism, that is gender discrimination, there are many, many things going on there.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Philadelphia area illustrates the extent to which disparities in coronavirus testing access grow out of systemic inequality in American society. Philadelphia is one of the poorest big cities in the nation, with about 25 percent of residents living below the poverty line. Bilal found that while the distribution of testing sites in Philadelphia has vastly improved from where it was at the beginning of the outbreak \u2014 with multiple options now available for residents in even the poorest areas \u2014 Black Americans in many low-income areas are still likely to find it difficult to get a COVID-19 test. Our analysis of the sites active in mid-June confirmed this.\n\nIn Kingsessing, a southwestern neighborhood that\u2019s around 80 percent Black, there\u2019s only one COVID-19 testing site, and that site has limited testing hours. Meanwhile, in the Center City area, there are several sites \u2014 some within a short walking distance of each other.\n\nAs is the situation in Philadelphia, many cities are now responding to calls to provide more resources to communities of color by increasing the number of pop-up sites to accommodate residents and ease the demand for more tests.\n\nSOUTH FLORIDA\n\nMartin Torres waited seven hours in line for a COVID-19 test at Hard Rock Stadium, an open-air venue best known as the home of the Miami Dolphins, while showing what he believed to be symptoms of the virus. When he finally reached the front, he was told he\u2019d get results back in five days.\n\nTwo weeks later, he is still waiting.\n\n\u201cI am kind of in a limbo waiting for when I can have a response for that,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nIn a statement responding to the demand in testing and the slower turnaround times, Quest Diagnostics, one of the major labs processing COVID-19 tests, said it will \u201ccontinue to ramp up capacity to reach 150,000 molecular diagnostic tests a day.\u201d\n\nFlorida, where the pandemic has recently spiked to nearly 370,000 confirmed cases, expanded testing capacity in response to problems surrounding testing access equity. But being a resident of a lower-income neighborhood still presents a challenge in terms of getting a COVID-19 test.\n\nThe South Florida region, which the census refers to as the Miami urbanized area, contains at least part of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, and has deep disparities in testing site availability in majority-Black, majority-Hispanic and majority-white neighborhoods, according to our analysis.\n\nThe neighborhoods included in the Miami urbanized area also have massive economic inequality, and disparities exist within different Hispanic communities. Yet the few testing sites in wealthy areas \u2014 such as Cooper City, a majority-white town located in Broward County just north of Miami-Dade \u2014 had a much smaller potential patient demand than sites in many of the more densely populated lower-income neighborhoods, many of which are majority Black or Hispanic.\n\nOn average, majority-Black areas had a potential community need 13 percent larger than majority-white census blocks. In majority-Hispanic areas, it was 29 percent larger, with the densely populated, predominantly Hispanic areas around South Miami showing a particularly high potential need.\n\nJust 10 miles south of Cooper City is Miami Gardens, a predominantly Black area in Miami-Dade County where the median household income is less than half that of Cooper City. If residents there want to get a test, they have to travel to Hard Rock Stadium and wait in a line that officials have advised could be as long as four hours in a summer heat that sometimes nears 100 degrees.\n\nThe long lines cause other problems, too. On most days at the Hard Rock Stadium testing site, it is not uncommon for testing to temporarily pause due to lightning in the area or because a car waiting in line breaks down due to mechanical issues.\n\n\u201cWe have seen cars run out of gas at some of the busier test sites, but we tell people that a little bit of planning and a lot of patience are required,\u201d said Mike Jachals, a state spokesman for several of the federally supported testing sites across the state.\n\nIn an emailed statement to ABC News and FiveThirtyEight, a state emergency management spokesman said Florida \u201cis continuing to increase COVID-19 testing daily.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said the county has made \u201ca concerted effort\u201d to put more testing facilities in lower-income communities throughout the county. As part of that effort, new pop-up sites at the Joseph Caleb Center in central Miami and Harris Field Park in south Miami-Dade, both located in predominantly Black or Hispanic areas, have been installed.\n\nIn Miramar, a city of about 140,000 just north of the Hard Rock Stadium, there\u2019s only one public COVID-19 testing center even though it happens to be the city with one of the largest percentages of Black people in Broward County. The city received the state funding necessary to open its first state-supported testing site just over a month ago, which local officials believe was far too late.\n\n\u201cInitially, I was very concerned, very upset,\u201d said Miramar Mayor Wayne Messam in response to a question about the lack of urgency in establishing testing facilities in the city. \u201cIt was very disappointing and upsetting, but I was actually happy once we did get the call notifying me that we would have the site and since that determination was made, we\u2019ve made the best of that site. It would have been ideal to have it up since the onset.\u201d\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA\n\nAfter touting a massive expansion of testing and stable case counts earlier this summer, California has in recent weeks been rolling back on its earlier promise of easy access to testing for every resident.\n\nCoronavirus hot spots in Southern California, in particular, are now putting back restrictions on community testing to prioritize symptomatic patients or those most at risk, such as nursing home residents and staff members.\n\nBased on ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis and reporting, communities of color and lower income-level neighborhoods in the San Diego and Los Angeles urbanized areas \u2014 where some of the biggest gaps in potential community need were seen between majority-white and majority-Black neighborhoods \u2014 are expected to suffer the most from the testing restrictions.\n\nAccording to our analysis of site locations in mid-June, in both the San Diego and Los Angeles areas, majority-Black neighborhoods were estimated to have around 30 percent higher potential need than majority-white neighborhoods.\n\nSAN DIEGO\n\nIn the San Diego urbanized area, much of which falls within the coastal section of San Diego County, many of the sites with lower potential patient demand are located in the predominantly white and wealthy neighborhoods along the northern part of the coast, while the sites expected to serve more people were all in the poorer, predominantly Black communities in the southern end of the city of San Diego.\n\nMost of the community sites in San Diego County, which tend to be busier than private sites, are by appointment, county Health and Human Services Agency spokesperson Tim McClain said, and with the recent spike in cases people have had to make appointments a week or more in advance.\n\nThat was the case for Holly Young, who lives in La Mesa, a suburb just east of the city of San Diego. Young, 60, said she sought testing earlier this month after she discovered that her son and his girlfriend had been in contact with a COVID-positive friend prior to seeing her.\n\nShe said her health care provider was unable to test her because she didn\u2019t show any symptoms, so she turned to a county testing site, for which she had to wait almost 10 days just to book an appointment and then drive an hour and 15 minutes to get to the site.\n\n\u201cI am in an essential industry, and part of my job is making the bank deposits, going to the post office and other routine tasks that were outside the business,\u201d said Young, who is a self-employed accountant with clients in retail. \u201cSo even though I was always masked, I still felt very vulnerable. I\u2019m overweight, take blood pressure medication and I smoked for 20 years, so I am not at all confident I would survive COVID-19.\u201d\n\nYoung was tested on July 11, and told she\u2019ll get her results in five to seven business days. But she went off a two-week self-quarantine last Thursday, meaning she had to return to work before getting her test results.\n\nThe disparity in access to tests hasn\u2019t been lost on Young, who said she is on Obamacare and does not get health care from her job: \u201cWe all know people who just call their doctor and get a test the next day. It shouldn\u2019t be this way.\u201d\n\nMcClain said San Diego County is exceeding state guidelines and offers widespread free and public testing access, but intends to do more to meet increasing public demand and reach deeper into at-risk communities. As of July 6, the county was surpassing the state goal of 4,950 daily tests \u2014 1.5 tests per day per every 1,000 residents \u2014 by 56 percent.\n\n\u201cAs tests became more widely available in spring, the county placed the greatest concentration of testing in our communities of diversity, and those near the border, and continues to bring more sites online,\u201d McClain said. \u201cTesting access is widely dispersed but we intend to make it more convenient with new locations, will add sites to address hotspots and will bring more no-appointment locations online.\u201d\n\nLOS ANGELES\n\nThe Los Angeles area has also managed to at least narrow some of the disparities. The poorer urban centers of Los Angeles were estimated to have greater community need than the relatively wealthier suburbs outside the city, as well as in Pasadena, though to a lesser degree.\n\nSince California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an aggressive expansion of the statewide testing capacity back in late April, the state has also significantly ramped up testing in underserved communities, setting up close to 100 state-supported community sites in its communities of color and lower-income neighborhoods. According to our analysis, predominantly Asian communities actually had less potential demand than other groups, including white neighborhoods.\n\nThat expansion appears to have helped collapse testing disparities in the region, according to our analysis of testing data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\n\nAt the end of April, mostly white cities and communities in Los Angeles County had, on average, more than 1,200 tests completed per 100,000 people. That was more than 65 percent more completed tests than communities of color.\n\nAfter Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced free COVID-19 testing for everyone in the county and expanded testing operations, the number of tests administered tripled.\n\nA month later, the racial testing gap had shrunk to just 24 percent between the most-white areas and the least white. About 6,200 tests per 100,000 people were completed in whiter areas and about 5,000 tests per 100,000 people in less white areas, according to the analysis of the city\u2019s testing data.\n\nThere was a similar pattern in wealthier and poorer areas. At the end of April, people were tested at a rate 60 percent higher in areas where the median household income was in the top quartile versus the bottom quartile. But by May 31, that gap had shrunk to just 13 percent.\n\nSince April, California has scaled up its statewide testing capacity from just 2,000 tests per day to more than 100,000 now, and has completed nearly 4.8 million tests since the pandemic began, the state\u2019s health department spokesperson told ABC News and FiveThirtyEight.\n\nAs cases and hospitalizations hit new records in the past couple weeks, however, the state is again struggling with testing capacity. The governor last week issued a new advisory to hospitals and labs, asking them to prioritize testing turnaround for individuals who are most at risk of spreading the virus to others, including those in nursing homes and congregate living settings.\n\nThe Castlight data analysis has helped shed light on the racial, ethnic and income disparities in the allocation of COVID-19 testing resources, and ABC News and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s reporting shows how gaps created by systemic inequity in the health care system continue to persist even as states, cities and counties step up efforts to address them.\n\nAs cases rise and states across the country begin to face testing constraints, more local governments and private providers say they are considering going back to prioritizing testing access to symptomatic patients and those most at risk. In some places, such as Sacramento, Calif., and Omaha, Neb., testing sites are even closing because of supply shortages. This is expected to create additional strain on testing for underserved communities as state or county-sponsored public sites and labs further limit testing access.\n\n\u201cOur response to COVID is a reflection of the existing biases we have in our healthcare system,\u201d said John Brownstein, the epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School. \u201cWhile governments are trying to close the gap, we still have a long way to go to make sure Americans have equal access to testing resources.\u201d\n\nFor Dr. Ala Stanford and her colleagues at the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium in Philadelphia, the choice early on was clear: adjust to a new normal of life indoors, or move swiftly to implement testing on the streets of Philadelphia to combat a virus that was proving deadly to Black communities.\n\nStanford says she felt compelled to respond as she did because she knew that the same health care disparities she learned about in medical school, and as a practicing doctor, were still at play in Philadelphia during the coronavirus crisis \u2014 the city in which she\u2019s spent her entire life.\n\n\u201cI stopped and said to myself: I\u2019m a business owner in private practice, I have access, I can order these lab kits like anybody else, I know where the people are that are hurting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am not afraid to go there.\u201d\n\nABC News\u2019 Briana Stewart and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Rachael Dottle contributed reporting.\n\nCLARIFICATION (July 23, 2020, 3:50 p.m.): This story has been updated to avoid using the phrase \u201cpeople of color\u201d for Hispanic people, some of whom are white.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-neighborhoods-have-more-access-to-covid-19-testing-sites/", "author": ["Soo Rin Kim", "Matthew Vann", "Laura Bronner", "Grace Manthey"]}, {"title": "How We Analyzed 7,914 COVID-19 Testing Sites And Found Racial Disparities", "text": "For our story on the distribution of COVID-19 testing sites, we wanted to develop a measure of how busy coronavirus testing sites were likely to be.

Every Risk Is A Decision.", "text": "It has been a summer of compromises, a season of bending the rules. If I wear a mask and I keep my distance, I can go for a walk with a friend. Hand sanitizer is a bulwark that allows my kids to play on an otherwise empty jungle gym. I believe the backyard has magical properties that will, probably, make it just safe enough to see people and talk to them. In the sun and fresh breeze, we give each other air hugs from six-ish feet away.\n\nMeanwhile, my hair grows, untrimmed, past my clavicle. When my friend, in some ways far more stringent on her social distancing and mask wearing than I am, told me about going in for her first cut since March, I winced involuntarily. I assume it\u2019s roughly the same face that she made when I confessed my masked trip to a clothing store to buy some summer dresses. Both of us know the safest thing \u2014 the thing most likely to prevent the spread of COVID-19 \u2014 would be to stay at home, alone. But we know we won\u2019t do that now. Can\u2019t do it. The idea of sticking with the safest thing has become almost as unthinkable as indulging in the danger of a movie in a theater or a drink at the bar. But in between those extremes, life has become a sticky bog in which we wade through evidence and convenience, hoping we\u2019re stepping on solid ground.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nWe can\u2019t live like we did before coronavirus. We won\u2019t live like we did immediately after it appeared, either. Instead, we\u2019re in the muddy middle, faced with choices that seem at once crucial and impossible, simple and massively complicated. These choices are an everyday occurrence, but they also carry a moral weight that makes them feel different than picking a pasta sauce or a pair of shoes. In a pandemic that\u2019s been filled with unanswerable questions and unwinnable wars, this is our daily Kobayashi Maru. And no one can tell us exactly what we ought to do.\n\nNot that there haven\u2019t been attempts at providing structure.\n\nRight now, you can go online and find multiple charts that will visually categorize what were once the activities of daily life by risk level. Some of these charts are evidence based, compiled by experts and (in my opinion) genuinely helpful. I particularly liked the one designed by epidemiologist Saskia Popescu and bioethecist Ezekiel Emanuel because it lays out not just the risk levels of various behaviors \u2014 getting a haircut, visiting the dentist, buying a new shirt \u2014 but also the underlying factors that can make an activity more or less risky. In general, research has shown that indoors is riskier than outside, long visits riskier than short ones, crowds riskier than individuals \u2014 and, look, just avoid situations where you\u2019re being sneezed, yelled, coughed or sung at.\n\nBut the trouble with the muddy middle is that a general idea of what is riskier isn\u2019t the same thing as a clear delineation between right and wrong. These charts \u2014 even the best ones \u2014 aren\u2019t absolute arbiters of safety: They\u2019re the result of surveying experts. In the case of Popescu\u2019s chart, the risk categorizations were assigned based on discussions among herself, Emanuel and Dr. James P. Phillips, the chief of disaster medicine at George Washington University Emergency Medicine. They each independently assigned a risk level to each activity, and then hashed out the ones on which they disagreed.\n\nTake golf. How safe is it to go out to the links? Initially, the three experts had different risk levels assigned to this activity because they were all making different assumptions about what a game of golf naturally involved, Popescu said. \u201cAre people doing it alone? If not, how many people are in a cart? Are they wearing masks? Are they drinking? \u2026. those little variables that can increase the risk,\u201d she told me.\n\nGolf isn\u2019t just golf. It\u2019s how you golf that matters.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nThose variables and assumptions aren\u2019t trivial to calculating risk. Nor are they static. There\u2019s different muck under your boggy feet in different parts of the country, at different times. For instance, how safe is it to eat outdoors with friends? Popescu\u2019s chart ranks \u201coutdoor picnic or porch dining\u201d with people outside your household as low risk \u2014 a very validating categorization, personally. But a chart produced by the Texas Medical Association, based on a survey of its 53,000 physician members, rates \u201cattending a backyard barbeque\u201d as a moderate risk, a 5 on a scale in which 9 is the stuff most of us have no problem eschewing.\n\nWhen we first noticed this apparent contradiction at FiveThirtyEight, some of us joked about how maybe a Texas barbecue wasn\u2019t the same thing as a picnic in New York or Minnesota. Ha ha, everything\u2019s bigger in Texas, even the guest list. But, come to find out, yeah, that\u2019s actually exactly the deal.\n\n[Related: How To Make Indoor Air Safer]\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of social distancing. And different sauce,\u201d said Mark Casanova, a Dallas palliative care specialist and member of the Texas Medical Association\u2019s COVID-19 task force, summing up what makes a Texas barbecue different. When he rated a backyard barbecue, he was thinking of a crowded event, where people roam from indoors to out and back again, and masks are scarce. When he was ranking risk, he was trying to think about real-world behavior, not necessarily the way to do each activity most safely. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a bar and saying, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll just sit by myself.\u2019\u201d Casanova said.\n\nExperts like Popescu and Casanova have focused on harm reduction \u2014 the same philosophy that leads thousands of American gym teachers to demonstrate putting condoms on bananas. We know, from basic understandings of human behavior, that people are going to do a thing (have sex, that is, not put condoms on a banana). So how can we help them be safer?\n\nBut we\u2019re used to safer sex \u2014 we\u2019re not used to safer daily existence. The muddy middle is frustrating not because we\u2019ve never found ourselves in this type of quagmire before, but because the scale of the swamp is so vast and because, just yesterday, it was a garden.\n\n[Related: Why It Took So Long For Politicians To Treat The Child Care Crisis As A Crisis]\n\nWe are faced with too many choices \u2014 not just what to do, but how to do it and when and where. The stakes are high, 140,000 people are dead in the U.S. and death rates are starting to climb again. And because of those stakes, we\u2019ve assigned a morality to all these choices \u2014 something that psychology researchers have shown leads us to frame things as \u201call good\u201d or \u201call bad\u201d and lose sight of the gray areas all around us. We\u2019re all bogged down and floundering, questioning our own goodness while we arch our eyebrows at our friends and argue over whose patch of muck is really solid ground.\n\nIn some ways, it would be easier to just not care, to be one of those people who see no difference among a park, a swamp and the rim of an active volcano, to be one of those people who is mentally living six months ago. Then I could cheerfully traipse from my backyard to a neighbor\u2019s driveway and then on to a dark corner booth somewhere with no worries. No stress. It would hardly even be a decision. Maybe I could even get angry about stores and cities setting up rules and see something like a mask requirement as a violation of my freedoms. Then I could be oblivious to the far more terrible freedom of the muddy middle \u2014 where everything is a choice, and they\u2019re all mine to make and to live with.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-decision-is-a-risk-every-risk-is-a-decision/", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"title": "How To Make Indoor Air Safer", "text": "If you\u2019re waiting for a break from bad news about COVID, don\u2019t hold your breath \u2014 or, actually, do hold your breath.\n\nExperts have understood for months that the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, can be spread by hitching a ride inside large respiratory droplets that are expelled when someone coughs, sneezes or talks. But there\u2019s growing evidence that smaller airborne particles called aerosols can carry and spread the virus, too.\n\nThe methods for preventing spread from respiratory droplets are familiar: social distancing, frequent hand-washing and wearing a mask. But the methods for stopping aerosols, which are lightweight and may be able to hang in the air for hours, are less obvious and often rely on technology. But can something like an air filter really stop a seemingly unstoppable pandemic?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the basics. The larger respiratory droplets that are known to spread the coronavirus are larger bits of spit and mucus that a person propels outward when they forcefully exhale. If the person is infectious, these droplets can be spiked with virus particles which, if they can find their way to your nose, mouth or eyes, can enter your body and cause infection. The droplets are between 5 and 10 microns across (a human hair is, on average, roughly 70 microns in diameter), and they\u2019re heavy, as far as bodily secretions go, so they quickly fall to the floor \u2014 or nearby surface, or nearby facial orifice. But when we talk or laugh or sing or even just breathe, we also produce smaller, lighter droplets (less than 5 microns) that evaporate before gravity can do its thing, causing the dried remnants to stay aloft like a microscopic feather.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, experts weren\u2019t sure if these aerosols could contain enough virus or hang around long enough to actually infect anybody. A person can\u2019t be infected by inhaling one or two viruses \u2014 they need to be exposed to a certain concentration of the virus before it can gain a foothold, though experts still aren\u2019t sure what this threshold, called the infectious dose, is. But now there\u2019s growing evidence that, yes, the aerosols carry the virus and, in a high enough concentration, can cause infection.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a process of elimination. You get to the point where you say, \u2018It sort of looks like aerosol transmission,\u2019\u201d said Lisa M. Brosseau, a research consultant at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. \u201cIn the midst of a pandemic, that\u2019s what you have. You take what evidence you have, what you can observe, and you draw conclusions from that.\u201d\n\nWhen people are outside, aerosol transmission is less of a concern because in wide-open spaces, these particles are quickly dispersed and diluted, making it difficult for an infectious concentration to accumulate, Brosseau said. It\u2019s like dropping some food coloring into a river. But indoors, especially if the ventilation is poor, it\u2019s much easier for aerosols to accumulate \u2014 more like dropping food coloring into a birdbath.\n\nSometimes, though, you can\u2019t avoid taking a dip in those murky waters. The good news is there are ways to dilute and clear out aerosols from indoor spaces. But it requires more effort.\n\nOpening a window can help because it forces fresh air in, and some of the contaminated air will make its way outside. \u201cThere is no doubt that, over time, on average, the concentration of aerosols is going to go down if you open up the windows,\u201d said Rajat Mittal, a mechanical engineering professor who studies aerodynamics at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBut if you\u2019re, say, sitting in a classroom in Minnesota in January, or Arizona in September, opening up the windows might not be the most practical solution.\n\nInstead, school boards and offices should look to their heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. But you can\u2019t just shuffle air around the building \u2014 that could spread the virus to even more places. Instead, you have to replace the air itself.\n\n\u201cYou can achieve an air change by one of two ways,\u201d said David Krause, a certified industrial hygienist and the owner of HealthCare Consulting and Contracting. The first is \u201cthrough the gross changeout of air, bringing in outside air and exhausting air from the room. Or you can achieve it by using high-efficiency filters that effectively remove virus-containing particles from the air.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nFilters can capture virus-laden particles through a number of methods, including physically trapping them with a fine enough filter and using electrostatic attraction to charge particles and force them to settle out of the air.\n\nTo catch the tiny aerosols that might be carrying the coronavirus, filters need a high enough MERV \u2014 yes, MERV. Surely you\u2019ve heard of the minimum efficiency reporting value before, no? A filter with a MERV rating of 1, for example, will capture less than 20 percent of particles that are 3 to 10 microns across. As the MERV rating increases, so does the number of particles it captures, along with the amount of force an HVAC system needs to push the air through the fine filter.\n\nTo effectively neutralize indoor transmission of the novel coronavirus, you\u2019d need a MERV of at least 13, according to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not recommending major modifications to most air conditioning systems. Many of them can simply change out one efficiency of filter for another,\u201d said William Bahnfleth, a professor of architectural engineering at Pennsylvania State University and the chair of ASHRAE\u2019s epidemic task force. \u201cI have MERV-13 filters in my home air conditioner.\u201d\n\nBut changing out the filter alone might not be enough. Krause pointed to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which were published before the COVID-19 pandemic, that outline exactly what standards buildings need to have to achieve \u201cairborne infection isolation,\u201d which means stopping the spread of aerosols smaller than 5 microns. At a minimum, buildings need to be reaching six air changes per hour, according to these CDC guidelines. Krause said the average commercial building now only performs one or two air changes per hour, and could squeeze in another with an air filtration system.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\n\u201cThe other four and a half or five air changes per hour, you\u2019re really going to have to rely on in-room, standalone, HEPA filter air cleaners,\u201d Krause said, referring to high efficiency particulate air filters. \u201cWe should be looking at these if we have any illusions of sending kids back to school.\u201d\n\nAll that filtration can be expensive, though. A commercial-sized MERV-13 filter can cost three to four times more than a lower-standard filter, and portable air cleaners can be up to $1,000 each, according to Krause, so the cost for offices and schools is not small. And using a filtration system creates a new risk for whoever has to change out the virus-soaked filters.\n\nStill, HVAC systems can\u2019t guarantee 100 percent safety. The idea behind all these air changes and filters is to dilute and clean the air so that aerosols can\u2019t build up into high concentrations. But it\u2019s impossible to guarantee that an aerosol will get sucked up by a filter or a ventilation system before it gets sucked up by a person, especially if a lot of people are close together for long periods of time.\n\nUltraviolet light filters could also help: UV light can kill microorganisms, including viruses, but the experts I spoke to raised concerns about this method. For one, killing the virus this way requires continually exposing it to UV light for several minutes \u2014 if it simply floats by a light, such as one in a vent, that might not be enough. For another, UV has other potential risks, including skin and eye damage.\n\nRegardless of what building managers choose to do, their efforts will be moot if people aren\u2019t also taking measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets by wearing masks, washing their hands frequently and practicing social distancing. All the open windows in the world can\u2019t help if you\u2019re swallowing globs of virus-laden spit.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci | FiveThirtyEight", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-make-indoor-air-safer/", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers"]}, {"title": "When Does A Pandemic Start To Erode Civil Liberties?", "text": "Mask mandates have become a polarizing issue across the country, from Arizona to Georgia.

But only recently has a broader swath of America tuned into the mess nestled inside it, one that parents have been sitting with for months: what to do with the kids.\n\nThere has been no federal plan to help American parents with child care, and they continue to wonder whether schools will really open their doors come the new school year. That lack of action is in direct contrast to other crises that have struck America recently. After the financial crash of 2008, there was a bailout and a stimulus plan. After the protests against police over the last few months, officials in cities and states responded with promises of better actions in the future but also, immediate policy implementation: New York state repealed a law that had shielded police personnel files, while the Minneapolis City Council voted to begin a process that could eventually lead to the dissolution of the city police as it\u2019s now known.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nBut on child care and school, a specific, urgent response has been missing, or at least one that acknowledges our new reality. President Trump threatened to withhold federal funding for education if schools didn\u2019t open back up, counter to schools\u2019 insistence they need more money to provide a safe education amid the pandemic. While the CARES Act, an omnibus COVID-19 relief bill signed into law in late March, gave extra stimulus funding to families with children, schools and child care businesses so they could remain afloat, a Democratic-backed bill to give a $50 billion bailout of the child care industry has gotten little attention. Teachers around the country have voiced doubt that necessary safety measures for in-school teaching will be sufficient, and Los Angeles Unified School District, one of the country\u2019s largest school systems, has decided not to reopen classrooms when schools go back in session in August. Some worry that while distance learning is safer, socially different children and those without stable internet connections or computers \u2014 who are already at the margins in normal times \u2014 will fall irrevocably behind.\n\nThere is no cohesive solution to America\u2019s child care problem. But the relative inattention to this crisis, one that\u2019s so foundational to a functioning society, the economy and family units across the country, is revealing. It shows that for all the changes that have happened in American life \u2014 more female elected officials, a MeToo movement and a workforce that is around 47 percent female \u2014 our power dynamics remain fundamentally skewed. We are failing to collectively understand what our most critical and pressing problems actually are.\n\n\u201cCare in general has always been seen as a sideline issue,\u201d Vicki Shabo of the left-leaning think tank New America said. \u201cA nice-to-have and not something that\u2019s necessary, and not something that\u2019s central for adults to be productive in the economy.\u201d Of course, now we\u2019re seeing how much of a misunderstanding that is. In a country where most men and women work even when they have children, having child care is inextricably linked to economic productivity \u2014 and not having it often hurts women most. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2015 found that in households with children under 6, women spent an hour a day doing child care, compared to the 25 minutes of care provided by men. It\u2019s easy to extrapolate this trend for pandemic times: American women will bear the brunt of the school and child care crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: COVID-19 deaths are rising. What will the U.S. do?\n\nYet, child care in particular hasn\u2019t often found itself at the forefront of political debate. Experts and activists I talked to for this story all used the same framing to talk about why: an American narrative that child care problems are individuals\u2019 problems, not society\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIf you think about child care traditionally before the pandemic, you probably didn\u2019t think about it too much before you had kids,\u201d Melissa Boteach, vice president of income security and child care at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said. \u201cThen you have kids, you\u2019re in the most stressful and resource-strapped part of your life: You\u2019re operating on three hours of sleep a night, you\u2019re financially squeezed, because at the very time you\u2019re taking off of work, you have diapers and wipes and formula and whatever else. You\u2019re in this total daze of early motherhood. That\u2019s probably not the time when you say, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to call my member of Congress.\u2019 You\u2019re feeling it like a personal issue.\u201d\n\nChild care isn\u2019t necessarily seen as a macroeconomic issue or a driver of labor force participation or GDP, Shabo said. And because of that, she said, it often takes a backseat to economic issues like wages when lobbying efforts happen. This is not to say that child care issues don\u2019t get attention \u2014 in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, which featured several female candidates, child care plans took a more front and center role in the campaign than they had in the past. One leading candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, co-authored a 2004 book, \u201cThe Two-Income Trap,\u201d which was about the ways the rising incomes of households with two full-time employed adults belied the heavy costs of essentials like child care. Warren thought child care costs were among the reasons the American middle class was in an economic crisis.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\n\u201cOur workplaces were built for white men,\u201d said Danielle Atkinson, the founder and director of Mothering Justice, a Detroit-area advocacy group for working families. The fact that parents are left to fend for themselves from birth to kindergarten and then during the after-school, pre-dinner hours, is an American tradition that seems to assume a readily available, at-home caregiver. (Atkinson pointed out the inextricable role black women have played in American child care; enslaved women often took care of white children.) The nuclear family with a stay-at-home parent (usually a mother) is an ideal that persists, or at the very least lingers in American life: only 18 percent of Americans in a 2018 Pew Research Survey thought it was ideal for both parents to work full time.\n\n\u201cThis conversation about school is really a conversation about work,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cThe conversation about returning to school is not based on health. It\u2019s about returning those workers to working and not looking after their children, so those children have to be somewhere.\u201d Essential workers in particular are being forced to make difficult choices about their children\u2019s care \u2014 many essential-worker jobs are lower wage \u2014 and many child care providers are in strapped situations. The work of child care providers, Atkinson said, is often undervalued \u2014 their median annual wage in 2017 was a little more than $22,000 annually, which is just above the federal government\u2019s poverty line for a family of three \u2014 and as Boteach pointed out, those workers could continue to risk greater infection rates as schools and work open back up. She highlighted the plan put forth by Senate Democrats, the Child Care Is Essential Act \u2014 which would provide a bailout to the suffering industry and additional money for those providers to buy personal protective equipment \u2014 and cited an estimate that the U.S. child care industry would need a $9.6 billion injection monthly to survive the pandemic.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nIt\u2019s more likely the next governmental nod to parents and their school-age children will come in the next iteration of the omnibus coronavirus relief package. Congressional Democrats have proposed $350 billion in funds for schools and universities to purchase PPE and clean their facilities. Republicans agree about more funds, though it\u2019s not clear what their proposed number is \u2014 some have argued that since many schools will be operating on a partly virtual basis, less federal funding is needed.\n\nThe moral tussling that many parents have been doing \u2014 go back to work and risk potential COVID-19 infection at day care or school \u2014 will likely continue to be subjected to partisan politics. Trump and his Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have been the loudest voices in recent days about sending children back to school at all costs, much to the chagrin of teachers, many of whom feel ill-prepared for the safety precautions necessary for in-person pandemic teaching. Ultimately, though, it is parents who are forced to make a choice. Atkinson, a mother of six, told me she would be keeping her children home in the fall.\n\n[Related: The Latest Political Polls Collected By FiveThirtyEight]\n\nFor those who focus on child care, the pandemic has perversely presented an opportunity to advance the cause of greater access to guaranteed services. \u201cThis pandemic has created greater alignment of experience, potentially, between white middle class folks who saw this as an individual issue that they were struggling with and outraged by but hadn\u2019t really taken action on and the longtime, long-standing lived experience of lower wage folks and people of color who have struggled for decades with the unaffordability of child care and the lack of care options to meet their work schedules,\u201d Shabo said.\n\nAtkinson said she also hoped the individualism narrative would be shattered by the current crisis. \u201cWe want to lift the veil away and help women, especially white women, know that you\u2019ve been lied to. You were sold a bunch of lies: \u2018if you just work harder, if you just slay sexism, you\u2019ll be OK.\u2019 But really, it\u2019s a tool to divide,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pandemic has shattered norms and paradigms ever since it arrived in the U.S. \u2014 our expectations of child care is no exception.

The transcript below has been lightly edited.\n\nsarah (Sarah Frostenson, politics editor): Earlier today, President Trump tweeted that the 2020 election should be delayed \u201cuntil people can properly, securely and safely vote.\u201d\n\nPostponing the election, of course, is not something the president can legally do. But it\u2019s also kind of besides the point. Trump has already been fighting to delegitimize the results come November, claiming that voting by mail can lead to mass voter fraud.\n\nSo let\u2019s dive into that. How would you describe Trump\u2019s efforts to throw November\u2019s results into question? He did something similar in 2016 when facing Hillary Clinton. How is this different?\n\nclare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): Well, in many ways it\u2019s exactly what Trump was doing in 2016. It\u2019s just that he\u2019s president now. And thus, his words are even more damaging (and they were already very damaging in 2016).\n\ngeoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, elections analyst): There\u2019s also a very important distinction here. Before, Trump was just a candidate casting doubt on the election, but now he\u2019s a sitting president doing that.\n\njulia_azari (Julia Azari, political science professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): I\u2019d characterize this as an exercise in control and influence over his party and the news cycle. Everyone is forced to respond to what he says, even if they\u2019re not responding positively. Trump isn\u2019t effective at that many aspects of the job, but he\u2019s pretty effective at agenda control.\n\nclare.malone: I would also say that calling for the delay of the actual vote feels VERY dictatorial in nature. Like, we\u2019ve perversely gotten used to the \u201cfake votes,\u201d \u201cfake news\u201d stuff. But encouraging a change in the election date feels sort of explicitly over a line.\n\nsarah: And to ask a somewhat obvious question \u2014 but one that has to be asked \u2014 this is another unprecedented, norm-defying and democratic-value jeopardizing moment, right? To put it another way, has another sitting president ever done this?\n\njulia_azari: I\u2019m always nervous about the \u201cnever\u201d question with past presidents, but yeah, most presidents have not been willing to take on all the formal rules, the legal system and other branches of government while in office. Congress \u2014 which has the power to change the date of an election \u2014 used to be stronger, too, and there was no Twitter. My go-to example for this is we still had a presidential election in 1864, during the Civil War.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: And in modern times, incumbents who have lost reelection have exited office without too much of a fuss. Take George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, or if we go further back, Herbert Hoover. Granted, incumbents don\u2019t often lose. So it\u2019s important to note that each of those incumbents lost decisively, meaning there wasn\u2019t much to stand on even if they had wanted to fight the result. But it\u2019s not like Gerald Ford created a stir in 1976 when he lost narrowly.\n\njulia_azari: Candidates have also conceded even when the election was a mess. See Al Gore in 2000, Samuel Tilden in 1876.\n\nsarah: But on this question of actually changing the election date. How much power does Trump have to do that?\n\nclare.malone: He does not have the power to change the date of the election.\n\njulia_azari: None. It\u2019s up to Congress, and elections are administered by the states.\n\nclare.malone: Here\u2019s my question, though: What happens if Trump refuses to leave the White House on Jan. 20, and there are no official election results at that point?\n\nLike, in that dire scenario (Trump not leaving, no clear winner) does House Speaker Nancy Pelosi become president and someone has to haul him out of the building?\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: If for some reason the Electoral College hasn\u2019t acted or the electoral votes haven\u2019t been certified by Congress, Trump\u2019s term ends on Jan. 20, according to the 20th Amendment. So there\u2019d be an acting president, who would be the Speaker of the House per the order set out by the Presidential Succession Act \u2014 assuming congressional elections occurred.\n\nBut of course, that\u2019s how it\u2019s written, not how it might go.\n\nsarah: Did someone mention \ud83e\udd41the 20th amendment\ud83e\udd41?\n\njulia_azari: I keep imagining this scenario, and I have to say, I have a hard time imagining that Trump refuses to leave office. I don\u2019t want to be complacent, but like a lot of people on Twitter, Trump seems to be comfortable tweeting out bold ideas and not as great at standing firm under political pressure.\n\nSo as I see it, there would be a couple of components needed for this to actually happen. There would be the political pressure \u2014 what are advisors, including Jared and Ivanka, telling him to do? This would help us understand if there are people who have influence over Trump who have some interest in seeing the system remain intact and legitimate.\n\nThe second thing would be the actual formal power \u2014 does the Secret Service force him out? Does the military gets involved? These are wild scenarios.\n\nI would be surprised if these institutions don\u2019t have plans for this somewhere, even if they are not publicly known.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: Not to take things down an even darker road, but in this scenario, I think it\u2019s important to consider how other institutions like the military act and how the president\u2019s supporters behave in the face of attempts to delegitimize the election results.\n\nclare.malone: Totally. I think that\u2019s where many people\u2019s minds go, too. And as a country, I think we are deeply uncomfortable (and rightly so) with the military being involved with a power transition. I mean, I personally find it incredibly chilling to consider.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: I\u2019ve seen Seven Days In May. Great movie but, uh yeah, disturbing.\n\nBut it\u2019s a sign of the times when you have Biden actually saying he thinks the military would escort Trump out of the White House if he refused to leave.\n\nsarah: Because that\u2019s the thing, as you\u2019re all saying, there are mechanisms via the 20th amendment to ensure Trump leaves office. But there\u2019s still a very real question of how some of this would actually be enforced if it came to this, right?\n\njulia_azari: Exactly. The 20th amendment was ratified to shorten the period between the presidential election in November and the inauguration, which had been in March. There was growing instability around the time it was ratified, after the 1932 election, and that\u2019s some of what it intended to deal with, but it wasn\u2019t really designed with this problem in mind.\n\nI\u2019m trying to stake out the ground that acknowledges a lot of people won\u2019t have much incentive to let Trump violate the rules in this way.\n\nclare.malone: Julia, when you say that a lot of people won\u2019t have incentive to let Trump act contrary to the rules, whom are you thinking of?\n\njulia_azari: I guess I\u2019m thinking of people who might want to run for president later.\n\nclare.malone: Republicans?\n\njulia_azari: Or make money off the Trump brand. This includes his kids, and yeah, other Republicans.\n\nclare.malone: That is, people with sway over him. Got it.\n\njulia_azari: Military leaders, too, as we saw many of them push back after the D.C. protesters incident in June.\n\nsarah: So let\u2019s talk about the other big doomsday scenario here: The results aren\u2019t considered legitimate. What are the signs that that idea is already taking root?\n\njulia_azari: That\u2019s a good way to frame that, but I\u2019m not sure there are signs that it\u2019s taking root any more than it\u2019s sorta been lurking in the conversation since 2016 \u2014 and even before.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: In the face of COVID-19, states are expanding absentee voting and, in some cases, vote-by-mail. But the president is making the case that mailed ballots are illegitimate and highly vulnerable to fraud \u2014 this is not true, of course, but by casting aspersions, he\u2019s setting up the potential for delegitimizing the results as they come in, on and after Election Day. And the after part is probably what really matters, especially if the election is close.\n\nclare.malone: Yeah, I was going to say, we\u2019ve spent the past 4 to 5 years conditioning a certain segment of the population to distrust most everything in American life, unless it comes from the president\u2019s mouth.\n\nSomeone shared this 2017 survey that found that around half of Republicans would be ok with delaying the 2020 election. Granted, the question was framed around whether people would support delaying the election to make sure people weren\u2019t voting illegally (a big claim of Trump\u2019s in 2016). But I still thought that was surprising.\n\nIt\u2019s especially striking when you get to 2020, and the questions revolve around the pandemic. I was shocked to see, for instance, the share of Republicans and Democrats who were willing to delay the election because of the pandemic (roughly 39 percent of Americans supported delaying the election, according to that survey from April).\n\nsarah: Yeah \u2026 it is mind boggling. That finding is also at least somewhat corroborated in this paper FiveThirtyEight contributor Lee Drutman published with the Voter Study Group earlier this year. In an examination of democracy in the U.S., Drutman and his coauthors found that both Republicans and Democrats were open to their preferred presidential candidate \u201crejecting the legitimacy of the election if they claim credible evidence of illegal voting or foreign interference.\u201d And in that vein, 29 percent of Republicans said it would be appropriate for Trump \u201cto refuse to leave office because he claims that he has credible evidence of illegal voting.\u201d\n\njulia_azari: One quibble with that study, though, knowing I have the utmost respect for Lee and his coauthors, is that each scenario lays out a justification for delaying the election, which I think makes it harder to say no. And I think people\u2019s willingness to tolerate this in practice is conditional on their evaluation of that evidence, the credibility of the claims and the person making the claims. (E.g., Trump, who isn\u2019t very popular.)\n\nclare.malone: Totally fair.\n\nI was pretty shocked in general to see how amenable people were to changing this very foundational thing! Even with the reasonings the survey questions provided them.\n\njulia_azari: I was, too, but I think it\u2019s not unreasonable for people to have limits on how much they trust elections if they think those elections were not administered fairly.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: And if the election is close and a state or two is in doubt, any questions about administration could become explosive. See: the 2000 election.\n\njulia_azari: Right. It\u2019s actually amazing how explosive that wasn\u2019t. But things are different now \u2014 I wonder how this plays out if we flip it around.\n\nLet\u2019s say Trump wins.\n\n(I mean, this sorta already happened in 2016. Trump won, yet he went right ahead and tried to delegitimize parts of an election he had won.)\n\nBut let\u2019s say it happens again, and he wins narrowly once again? Who questions the results? And would that be the right thing to do?\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: Yes, I wanted to bring this up! Trump said there were at least 3 million illegal votes in an election he won \u2014 conveniently undoing Clinton\u2019s popular vote margin. And then he set up a task force to investigate fraud after he took office. It found nothing.\n\njulia_azari: But there will likely be this question of \u201ccredible evidence,\u201d as they cite in that Voter Study group paper. What if Trump wins, and people were standing in hours-long lines in Black neighborhoods in Ohio?\n\nIn other words, I think there will be a question of how much skepticism about elections is reasonable, and how much is chaos?\n\nclare.malone: I think there is just going to be skepticism about this election, full stop.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: I would not discount opponents of Trump taking to the streets in that scenario. A recent simulation by a group of experts about what could happen in these sorts of scenarios did not bring me much comfort. They found that every scenario \u2014 Trump winning or losing but someone defying the result \u2014 ended in street-level violence and political gridlock.\n\nsarah: Oof. It\u2019s interesting to me, though, that the desire to delegitimize results isn\u2019t purely a Republican thing, as that Voter Study paper found. Democrats also showed signs of also being willing to reject the legitimacy of the election if it helps their preferred candidate.\n\nclare.malone: Stacey Abrams\u2019s non-concession concession speech in 2018 provided an interesting template for a potential Biden response (in case of a loss to Trump).\n\nThough I do think Biden is such a conventional politician and institutionalist that he wouldn\u2019t respond in the same way Abrams did, justified or not.\n\nsarah: Yeah and Biden obviously isn\u2019t waging a campaign of disinformation in the way that Trump is either. But perhaps one unintended effect of all this is, to Clare\u2019s point, that skepticism of the election (depending on its margin) is going to be rampant.\n\njulia_azari: Although Biden seems like \u2026 truly angry at times about the Trump presidency. It\u2019s not obvious what the institutionalist move is in that scenario, IMO.\n\nclare.malone: A good point!\n\njulia_azari: I think there\u2019s a strong possibility that skepticism is persistent and embedded in Trumpist ideology and among his followers, but not that widespread if the election is not close.\n\nclare.malone: I mean, let\u2019s go back to 2016.\n\nIf Trump had lost, we were all preparing for the launch of Trump TV, a perch from which he would rail for the impeachment of President Clinton.\n\nI can sort of see something similar happening if Trump loses (unless, of course, he\u2019s too tired to start the Trump TV experiment!)\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: OANN would love to have him.\n\njulia_azari: Again, I don\u2019t want to be complacent. I spend way too much time on politics Twitter. I spend all my time on politics Twitter.\n\nBut if Biden wins by a lot and Trump tweets a bunch, most Americans will just go on about their lives. That\u2019s sorta how 2000 played out, and that was obviously really close and subject to questions, too.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: Thing is, I can\u2019t imagine Trump conceding in a 2000-esque situation in the way Gore eventually did.\n\nclare.malone: Of course, 2000 is the election that a lot of people point to as the start of mistrust in elections as institutions. And like, the era of \u201cvoter fraud\u201d alarmism really ramped up under George W. Bush.\n\njulia_azari: But the angry minority has demonstrated that it can drive politics and policy to a great degree. So I don\u2019t want to be complacent, but I do want to be specific in my fears.\n\nclare.malone: So you could say people went on with their lives, but there were corrosive effects.\n\njulia_azari: If he loses, I sometimes imagine that people around Trump will say, \u201cPeople will say nice things about you if you do a good concession speech,\u201d and so he does. But it\u2019s not encouraging that that\u2019s what it might come to.\n\nclare.malone: Right, the integrity of democratic institutions might come down to a pep talk from \u201cJavanka?\u201d\n\nsarah: So at the outset of this chat, I asked how Trump\u2019s tweet to postpone the election was different from what he\u2019s already done to try and delegitimize November\u2019s result. And we\u2019ve also pointed out that there have been prior points in American history where voters have mistrusted election results.\n\nBut I think given the abnormal aspects of Trump\u2019s presidency, it\u2019s easy to point to historical comparisons without really probing whether the moment we\u2019re in doesn\u2019t have a historical comparison, as historian Rick Perlstein did in his tweet, telling the media he didn\u2019t want to do more interviews on how this moment might compare to 1968.\n\njulia_azari: I think Perlstein is right, but I also think that we should be precise about how abnormal politics interacts with normal politics, because that has been the story of the Trump presidency IMO.\n\nclare.malone: So, I mean, I take Rick\u2019s point in this tweet; there\u2019s this instinct that we have to comfort ourselves with history (i.e., American democracy has weathered much worse) but I do think that we sometimes dwell a bit in history without facing the new challenges that Trump presents us.\n\nWe sort of have to respect the new paradigm that\u2019s been created and understand that there are limits to what history can teach us in this particular case; i.e., Twitter, plus Trump, plus 20 years of diminishing electoral trust.\n\ngeoffrey.skelley: It\u2019s interesting that people would comfort themselves with history \u2014 I take little comfort from it. We\u2019ve been on the brink before with the 1876 election, for instance.\n\njulia_azari: I think that\u2019s absolutely true. I don\u2019t see history as a comfort but rather as a guide to how much luck and skill it takes to maneuver through this stuff.\n\nI also think history is helpful because it shows what\u2019s not normal.

But for more than a century, this hasn\u2019t posed much of an issue: Until the 1960s, Republicans and Democrats competed for both densely and sparsely populated states at roughly the same rate\n\nBut over the last several decades, that\u2019s changed. The parties have reorganized themselves along urban-rural lines, and there is now a clear and pronounced partisan small-state bias in the Senate thanks to mostly rural, less populated states voting increasingly Republican. In fact, it\u2019s reached the point that Republicans can win a majority of Senate seats while only representing a minority of Americans.\n\nOne way to observe this growing partisan bias in the Senate is to compare the party makeup of senators elected to represent the 15 most populous states (which have collectively housed about two-thirds of population since the turn of the 20th century) to the partisan makeup of senators elected to represent the 25 least populous states (which have collectively housed roughly a sixth of the population consistently since the 1960s). As the chart below shows, the partisan makeup of the Senate was fairly even until the 1960s, when Republicans started to amass a partisan advantage in less populated states.\n\nWhat happened? Much of this follows from the post-civil rights realignment of American partisan politics, in which the Democratic Party became more consistently liberal (and thus more appealing in big, largely urban states), and the Republican Party became more consistently conservative (and thus more appealing in small, largely rural states). But that gap has also widened in recent years, especially starting in 2015, when Republicans took back a Senate majority, flipping seats in small states like West Virginia, South Dakota, Arkansas, Alaska and Montana \u2014 all states that will be tough for Democrats to regain in 2020.\n\nAnd what this has meant practically is that Republicans now hold a majority of Senate seats while only representing a minority of Americans, as you can see in the chart below.\n\nThis imbalance is significant because it poses a real obstacle to Democrats taking back a Senate majority in 2020. Take Democrats\u2019 current odds of retaking the chamber. The Cook Political Report recently said Democrats are favored to win the Senate, but considering Democrats currently lead the generic ballot for Congress by over 8 percentage points and have a similar margin nationally in the presidential race, it\u2019s remarkable that they still are only slight favorites to control the upper chamber.\n\nEven if D.C. or Puerto Rico were states (as some on the left advocate), Republicans would still have the advantage. It\u2019s true that the statehoods of D.C. and Puerto Rico would help Democrats close the small-state gap, but even if both were states and elected two Democratic senators, Republicans would still have had a two-seat majority in 2019, while only representing 48 percent of the population.\n\n[Related: The Latest Political Polls Collected By FiveThirtyEight]\n\nThe Senate has always held a contested place in America\u2019s democratic system because of its non-proportional qualities. For the first half of the 19th century, the Senate was a bulwark for the South, with an equal balance of slave and free states despite the growing Northern population advantage. And in the second half of the 19th century, Republicans attempted to \u201cstack\u201d the Senate by admitting a large number of Republican states into the union, starting with Nevada in 1864 (population of just 6,857(!) in the 1860 census), Nebraska (1867), Colorado (1876), Montana, Washington, and North and South Dakota as separate states in an 1889 omnibus, and Idaho and Wyoming in 1890.\n\nBut despite rising prairie populism spreading through the Great Plains to the Mountain West in the 1890s, Republicans\u2019 hopes for a stacked Senate didn\u2019t work out quite as planned. And thanks to the way the American two-party system developed in the 20th century, with Democrats and Republicans both containing urban liberal and rural conservative wings, the small-state bias of the Senate never became a real partisan issue \u2014 until now. It will likely remain an issue, too, as long as one party is able to win a majority in the chamber while only representing a minority of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence Interval: Democrats could win 60 Senate seats | FiveThirtyEight", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-senate-has-always-favored-smaller-states-it-just-didnt-help-republicans-until-now/", "author": ["Lee Drutman"]}, {"title": "What Trump Could Learn From NASCAR", "text": "NASCAR is niche. A recent Morning Consult survey of the sport\u2019s fans found that they\u2019re much more male, white and Southern than other sports fans are. It\u2019s a subculture status that some fans have relished but which NASCAR itself seems eager to shake \u2014 in the last two years, its TV ratings bottomed out after peaking in the mid-2000s, according to SportsBusiness Journal. They\u2019ve declined for six years running, in fact. Since the mid-aughts, the sport has actively sought to expand its fan base \u2014 seeking race venues outside the South, for example \u2014 and in doing so, sometimes drawing the ire of its core fans. \u201cWe believe strongly that the old Southeastern redneck heritage that we had is no longer in existence. But we also realize that there\u2019s going to have to be an effort on our part to convince others to understand that,\u201d then-NASCAR President Mike Helton said in 2006.\n\nLike so many institutions in American life, the sport was grappling with what its place would be in a more diverse county and culture.\n\nSo when the NASCAR Cup Series\u2019 only Black driver, Bubba Wallace, called for a ban of the Confederate flag earlier this summer, saying \u201cNo one should feel uncomfortable when they come to a NASCAR race,\u201d NASCAR readily complied. It had already formally asked fans to stop bringing the flags to events in 2015 following the murders of nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., by a white supremacist. President Trump weighed in on NASCAR\u2019s decision, tweeting that its flag ban was to blame for its \u201clowest ratings EVER!\u201d (ratings are actually up following the flag ban).\n\nBut according to the Morning Consult survey from June, 44 percent of NASCAR fans agree with the president and said that fans should be allowed to bring the flag to races. Only 30 percent were fine with the ban. And at NASCAR races in June and July, Confederate flags reappeared. Not in the stands, but high above them; a group called the Sons of Confederate Veterans rented planes to fly the flag over the racetracks. The group\u2019s leader, Paul Gramling Jr., told the Columbia Daily Herald that \u201cThe Sons of Confederate Veterans is proud of the diversity of the Confederate military and our modern Southland. We believe NASCAR\u2019s slandering of our Southern heritage only further divides our nation.\u201d\n\n[Related: Confederate Statues Were Never Really About Preserving History]\n\nGramling\u2019s statement about the \u201cdiversity\u201d of the Confederate army and his use of the term \u201cmodern Southland\u201d speak volumes. Enslaved men were conscripted as soldiers and servants in the Confederate Army \u2014 they were hardly volunteers for the Southern cause \u2014 and Gramling\u2019s \u201cSouthland\u201d conjures the image of a cohesive nation, as if the Confederacy, which existed for less than five years, had not been decimated long ago.\n\nThe SCV and NASCAR\u2019s oblique tussling might seem like a fringe issue in an election year when a pandemic and an economic crisis imperil millions of lives, but their divergent visions of what the culture of the American South is \u2014 who it\u2019s for and of \u2014 embodies much about the political and cultural climate in which we find ourselves. Trump and NASCAR are in similar positions: overly reliant on a slowly shrinking, mostly white base. NASCAR is trying to expand its audience in order to stay relevant; Trump is not. The sport has realized something that the president can\u2019t seem to grasp, which is that overt shows of racism turn most Americans off.\n\nElectoral politics has played a role in normalizing on a national level the kind of neo-Confederate views that the SCV \u2014 and Trump \u2014 have condoned and promoted in recent weeks. You don\u2019t have to have grown up in the American South to have thought that the Confederate flag was inextricably tied to what the SCV calls \u201cSouthern heritage,\u201d but which really means a particular slice of Southern white culture. Going back decades, blocks of white votes in the South have been courted aggressively by non-Southerners who have played to the culture that has grown around these symbols and a particular nostalgic language about the Confederate past. During his 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan, a California governor of Illinois birth, appeared in Neshoba County, Mississippi \u2014 where Freedom Rider activists were famously murdered in 1964 \u2014 and gave a speech about \u201cstates\u2019 rights,\u201d which was read by many as euphemistic in the most loaded way possible, given the context of the place. The country had gotten comfortable with delicate work-arounds like that \u2014 the Civil War wasn\u2019t about slavery, it was about states\u2019 rights. For decades, parts of the country have tolerated a semantic category that blandly normalized a strain of white resentment at the Confederate defeat. Sometimes the language is more blunt, of course: the War of Northern Aggression, \u201cthe South will rise again\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s only halftime.\u201d\n\n[Related: Our 2020 National Polling Averages]\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, 55 percent of the country\u2019s Black population live in the South. While the region is still nearly 60 percent white, its Black and Hispanic populations are significant, and while traditionally rural, diverse, growing cities like Atlanta and Charlotte have become important business hubs. North Carolina\u2019s Research Triangle region boasts the sort of academic power and national draw often associated with the Northeast Corridor\u2019s Ivy League. NASCAR\u2019s bid to diversify, geographically and otherwise, is in keeping with the modern South\u2019s changes.\n\nBut strong vestiges of the racist Confederacy have held on in the region. Mississippi removed the Confederate stars and bars from its state flag only last month, becoming the last state in the Union to do so. While the majority of Americans \u2014 52 percent \u2014 favored the removal of Confederate statues from public spaces, according to a Quinnipiac University survey from June, 52 percent of those from the South opposed removal, the only region of the country where a majority supported keeping the statues.\n\nIn the midst of a floundering campaign, Trump grasped onto Southern white culture \u2014 that particular strain of it \u2014 as a way to pull his head above water. A large base of his support does indeed lie in the South, as has been the case for all recent Republican presidential candidates; Bill Clinton won Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia in 1996, but no Democrat has since. Trump ran a race-baiting campaign in 2016, and his 2020 campaign has continued to play on long-standing tropes of racial fear, like violent \u201cliberal Democrat\u201d cities. Ironically, his use of federal law enforcement officers in Portland, Ore., is about as far from states\u2019 rights as you can get.\n\nBut Trump seems to be speaking to the SCV types and not the more \u201cmainstream\u201d white voters he actually needs to win. The SCV, for what it\u2019s worth, is more than the \u201chistorical, patriotic, and non-political organization\u201d that its website says it is. Its branches have donated to Republican politicians and it controversially purchased the Silent Sam Confederate statue that was torn down at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In other words, the group is representative of the types of (white) voters who are Trump\u2019s ride-or-dies.\n\n[Related: How Popular Is President Donald Trump?]\n\nBut Trump has misjudged \u2014 or refuses to see \u2014 that much of white America is changing how it thinks about racial issues. A Monmouth University survey from June found that 49 percent of white Americans thought police were more likely to use excessive force against a Black person, up from only 25 percent in 2016. A Morning Consult poll from May and June of this year found that 49 percent of white Americans supported the protests unfolding across the country, and 54 percent of suburbanites supported them (white people are the majority in 90 percent of America\u2019s suburban counties, according to Pew Research Center).\n\nSomeone seems to have leaned into Trump\u2019s ear and told him he needs these white suburbanites in order to have a fighting chance of winning in November. Last week, he called on \u201cThe Suburban Housewives of America\u201d \u2014 as if harkening to a membership organization from 1955 \u2014 and said that presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden would \u201cdestroy\u201d their American dream by promoting affordable housing for all in the suburbs. In Trump\u2019s framing, by hoping to diversify the suburbs, Biden would destroy the \u201cSuburban Lifestyle Dream.\u201d A majority of Americans in a Pew survey conducted in 2019 said Trump had made race relations in the country worse, and while white, Black and Hispanic people still differ in their views on racial issues, it\u2019s clear that recent events have brought greater racial awareness to the forefront of white Americans\u2019 minds.\n\n[Related: A Tale Of Two Suburbs]\n\nRepublicans are increasingly worried about Trump losing a state like Ohio \u2014 once thought solidly in Trump\u2019s camp \u2014 in large part because of the president\u2019s diminishing support in suburban areas. (I wrote at length about this Ohio suburban phenomenon back in 2019.) His embrace of the racist totems of the white South \u2014 which large swaths of the white South itself eschews \u2014 could now potentially cost Trump with the Midwestern or Northeastern (whatever you want to call Pennsylvania) voters he needs to hold onto in order to win.\n\nTrump, a New York City-born pol who doesn\u2019t quite seem to \u201cget\u201d the \u2018burbs \u2014 and has never been a particularly subtle political thinker or communicator \u2014 crucially misunderstood that the muscular Southern racism the Confederate flag has long represented doesn\u2019t work in the white suburban realms of respectability anymore. That cohort \u2014 Republican and Democratic \u2014 absorbs and displays its biases more mutedly in 2020. Trump, who came to political power riding a wave of racist conspiracy theory \u2014 it was only fair to ask questions about whether the first Black president was actually American, wasn\u2019t it? \u2014 now suddenly seems ill-equipped for the political times.\n\nHe forgot that most of the country requires a modicum of plausible deniability in its dog whistles.\n\n\n\n\n\nNate Silver doesn\u2019t buy that Trump\u2019s fate is sealed, \u2018a lot could change in 100 days\u2019", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-trump-could-learn-from-nascar/", "author": ["Clare Malone"]}, {"title": "Fear Not, Readers: We Have RSS Feeds", "text": "Fear Not, Readers: We Have RSS Feeds\n\nUpdate (March 28): Our readers have spoken, and we listened.

But are you going to vote for Trump this fall?\n\nWill Hurd: Like a lot of Americans, I wish I had different options on the ballot. And my plan is always to support a Republican and we\u2019re going to be making those decisions over the next 98 days.\n\nGD: So you\u2019re going to decide whether or not to vote for him over the next 98 days?\n\nWH: That is how I always approach my election. I\u2019m just like everybody else.\n\nGD: Well, you previously said that you will vote for Trump this fall. So I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re hesitant a little bit now?\n\nWH: I think that\u2019s accurate.\n\nYour polling is showing that. I\u2019m like everybody else. I don\u2019t want to vote for a Joe Biden because in the end, some of the policies, I think that a unified Democratic Party is going to pass \u2026 would be tough for the country, and things that I don\u2019t support, and haven\u2019t supported during my time in Congress. And as somebody who\u2019s represented a large, competitive district, I know something about competitive districts and what needs to be done in order to win.\n\nGD: I understand that desire not to vote for Joe Biden, but I guess more specifically on whether or not you\u2019ll vote for Trump, what could change your mind in the next 98 days that would make you view him and his presidency differently than what he\u2019s shown us so far?\n\nWH: It\u2019s a good question and who knows. I don\u2019t think a year ago we would have been thinking about a global pandemic that would have impacted the entire world and brought the world economy to a standstill. And so who knows what can happen over these next few weeks.\n\nBut in the end, what I think that I\u2019ve been trying to preach to my colleagues is that we have to change as a Republican Party. We have to start appealing to broader groups of people. And if we don\u2019t, and also if the Republican Party doesn\u2019t start looking like America, we\u2019re not going to have a Republican Party in America.\n\nGD: Everything you\u2019re saying here makes it sound like you aren\u2019t voting for Trump. Is that the case?\n\nWH: As I said, I don\u2019t like either one of my choices. And in the end, we\u2019re going to evaluate this over the next 90 days, or 96 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Will Hurd on whether he\u2019ll vote for Trump l FiveThirtyEight\n\nOn delaying the election:\n\nGD: President Trump suggested delaying the presidential election, which Congress has the power to do, your branch of government. Do you support delaying the election?\n\nWH: We are not an authoritarian government where the head of state gets to decide on a whim when an election happens. So no, this is Congress\u2019s role, as you said. It should go forward as has been established. And ultimately, look, I\u2019m of the opinion that we should be increasing the ways for people to vote, right, the more people that vote, the better off it is. And this is something that I\u2019ve been able to prove, during my time in Congress, that if you take a message to more people, you can get it to resonate with more people and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep. Will Hurd On President Trump\u2019s Suggestion To Delay The Election\n\nOn the U.S. response to COVID-19:\n\nGD: Overall, do you think the country is doing a good job combating the pandemic?\n\nWH: No. We have increasing death rates, right? We have the most number of people that are dealing with this right? I think the impact it\u2019s had on the United States of America versus other countries is still \u2026 we\u2019re dealing with one of the worst cases. We\u2019re having debates on whether you should be wearing a mask or not. Wear a mask! Right? A mask is to protect yourself but also to protect the people around you. So why are we debating that? This debate and fights around whether school should open or not \u2014 we should be talking about, \u2018how do we work together in order to exceed CDC guidelines on opening schools?\u2019, not whether or not it should happen.\n\nAnd so yeah, there are all kinds of problems. But I\u2019m always trying to work with these folks to deal with the problem as it is right now. I know in Texas, a third of the deaths of coronavirus have been in nursing homes. That\u2019s outrageous. And then also in prisons. And so if we couldn\u2019t handle this in nursing homes or in prisons, how are we going to be handling it in an educational environment where it is even more chaotic than those other places? So yeah, we have a long way to go.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep. Will Hurd On How The U.S. Is Doing On COVID-19\n\nOn the future of the Republican party:\n\nGD: Let\u2019s talk about where the Republican Party is headed. You said that the Republican Party needs to look more like America. And you know, right now, it doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re the only Black lawmaker on the Republican side in the House. Why do you think there are so few Black lawmakers in the Republican caucus in the house?\n\nWH: Everybody asked me when I first got elected, how does a Black Republican represent a 71 percent Latino district? And I say it\u2019s because you know, I work hard and I show up to communities that had never seen a Republican show up, and you do that multiple times. If you\u2019re showing up 90 days before an election, that\u2019s called pandering.\n\nYou have to be in those communities. Showing up is half the battle. And unfortunately, I think over time, professional political consultants talk about focusing on your likely \u201cx voter\u201d \u2014 whether that\u2019s a Republican primary voter or Democratic primary voter \u2014 rather than trying to grow and appeal to a broader group of people. It\u2019s hard.\n\nGD: Do you think that part of the reason has to do with Republicans actively appealing to a white identity?\n\nWH: Look, I think when you look at a person like a Steve King \u2014 and you know Steve King losing his primary is ultimately a good thing \u2014 but when you know folks that that have been elected as a Republican that say racist or misogynistic or homophobic things, that hurts all of us that identify with with being a Republican.\n\n\u2026 But what I found is that\u2019s not everybody. But yeah, over time, have those things been said? Yes. And Does that hurt? Yes. And that\u2019s why we have to speak out when those things do happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep.

The team, which opened its 2020 training camp on Tuesday, lost the 2018 AFC wild card game at home to the Los Angeles Chargers before suffering a stunning upset in the divisional round last season at the hands of the upstart Tennessee Titans.\n\nBut the way the team finished doesn\u2019t diminish what it did between those two losses. Head coach John Harbaugh said during a preseason interview last year that his team would have a revolutionary offense in its first full season with Lamar Jackson under center, and he was right.\n\nJackson was unanimously voted the league\u2019s MVP, and the team finished the regular season with the best record in the NFL, the league\u2019s top-scoring offense and the best rushing attack in NFL history. While the second-year quarterback\u2019s elevated play was key to the unit\u2019s success, the usage of its trio of tight ends and the stable of backfield mates for Jackson allowed the offense to truly flourish \u2013 especially out of heavy formations.\n\nAlthough the Ravens used a variety of personnel sets, their heavy formations garnered national attention because they contradicted the rest of the NFL. While the rest of the league was building offenses out of spread formations, Baltimore designed a system that ran nearly half of its plays from heavy formations, according to ESPN\u2019s Stats & Information Group. Out of 1,060 total offensive snaps in the regular season, Baltimore lined up 453 times (or 42.7 percent of its snaps) in heavy formations that featured different pairs of the tight ends plus Ricard. Meanwhile, the rest of the league lined up for only 27 percent of plays from heavy sets.\n\nIn 2019, Baltimore relied extensively on fullback Patrick Ricard and tight ends Mark Andrews, Nick Boyle and Hayden Hurst. The team traded Hurst to Atlanta in the offseason, but undrafted rookie Eli Wolf will compete for that third tight end spot with Charles Scarff, who spent last year on the practice squad. So it seems likely that the Ravens will continue this scheme this year.\n\nThe members of Baltimore\u2019s tight end/fullback crew were reliable blockers for Jackson and the running backs (Mark Ingram, Gus Edwards and Justice Hill) as well as viable receivers, which allowed the offense to use multiple variations of the group within the heavy sets to keep defenses guessing. In some cases, the team even had all four on the field at once.\n\nDespite having fewer total rushing yards and yards per carry with heavy personnel than with spread personnel (the Ravens rushed for 1,089 yards in heavy sets while rushing 1,560 yards in spread sets), the team\u2019s production within the heavy sets was vital to its success because it used them to extend drives and control the clock. But perhaps even more important was Baltimore\u2019s third-down conversion rate on plays from heavy packages: The unit converted 69 percent of third downs during the regular season. Converting on these downs at such a high rate led to the team averaging nearly 35 minutes of possession time.\n\nTheir production on the ground also regularly opened up the passing game by forcing defenses to use personnel packages designed for crowding the line of scrimmage. This created opportunities for the offense to capitalize on mismatches by forcing bigger and slower defenders to cover the tight ends. Jackson was able to make the most of these moments, as each of the three tight ends recorded at least 20 receptions for over 200 yards. Andrews, Boyle and Hurst averaged 12.3 yards per reception while accounting for over half of the team\u2019s 1,569 total passing yards from heavy formations. Although Ricard was mostly used as a blocker throughout the season, he also recorded a touchdown catch out of a heavy set and finished the regular season with eight total catches for 47 yards.\n\nThe depth and versatility of the group enabled them to account for nearly half of the team\u2019s total receiving yards and 15 of Jackson\u2019s 36 passing touchdowns. Andrews finished the regular season as the team\u2019s leading receiver, with 852 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns, and he led all tight ends in touchdowns.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s postseason loss to the Titans showed what can happen if teams are able to limit the team\u2019s dynamic rushing attack. After allowing the Titans to take a 14-point lead early in the second quarter, the Ravens started favoring the pass in an attempt to cut the lead. Jackson recorded a career-high 22 pass attempts in the first half, while the team had only 16 first-half rushing attempts. Jackson finished the game with 59 passing attempts, another career high.\n\nJackson and the offense went into halftime with season lows in total rushing yards and yards per carry. The unit averaged 3.81 yards per rush and gained only 61 yards on the ground. After averaging more than 37 rush attempts per game during the regular season, Baltimore finished the game with 29 carries \u2013 tying the second-lowest total of carries the team recorded in a game all season.\n\nThe Ravens\u2019 struggles were most apparent on a pair of fourth downs. Coming into the postseason, Baltimore had converted on eight of eight fourth-and-1 attempts, but it failed to convert on fourth-and-1 in the second quarter and again in the third against the Titans. The offense posted its third-lowest total of snaps and yards gained from heavy formations in the loss (17 plays for 77 yards) and also completed a season-low 37.5 percent of passes from heavy sets.\n\nWhile Baltimore\u2019s last outing was another postseason disappointment, the team\u2019s future is still bright as it heads into another season. What remains to be seen is whether the rest of the league will have caught on to the Ravens\u2019 unconventional offensive approach and devised a way to stop it, or if Jackson and his plethora of diverse weapons will carry them to another postseason.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-baltimore-ravens-used-their-tight-ends-differently/", "author": ["Andres Waters"]}, {"title": "Gun Sales Are Surging, But Background Checks Aren\u2019t Keeping Up", "text": "Gun sales were so slow earlier this year that in February, The New York Times ran a piece on how some gun manufacturers were looking to rebrand to make up for the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d\n\nBut then the pandemic hit. And on Friday, March 13, when President Trump declared a national emergency, the number of background checks went through the roof, according to the FBI system that vets gun buyers.\n\nIn March, the FBI received almost 1.5 million requests for background checks, according to data the bureau released to FiveThirtyEight in response to a public records request. On Friday, March 20 alone, 104,084 background check requests were sent to the bureau; according to a slightly different measure that includes checks run by state systems, that day saw the highest daily number of background checks on record. In fact, by that broader measure, five of the gun background check system\u2019s 10 busiest days were in March 2020. While March is usually a busy month for background checks, it was off the charts this year.\n\nBut the number of background checks didn\u2019t just go up. As you can see in the chart below, as the number of background checks sent to the FBI rose, so did the percentage that were delayed more than three business days \u2014 a critical deadline after which federal law allows dealers to legally sell a gun without a completed background check.\n\nThis is significant because it means that it may have been easier for guns to get into the hands of people who cannot legally own them.\n\nThe danger here isn\u2019t theoretical. Dylann Roof was able to buy the gun he used to kill nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 because of this loophole. Roof had a record for drug possession that meant he couldn\u2019t legally own a gun, but after the three-day period passed, the gun dealer sold him a gun anyway.\n\nTo be sure, these numbers aren\u2019t a perfect portrait of gun sales: They don\u2019t include data from 20 states that process some or all of their background checks themselves rather than through the FBI. And not every background check represents a gun sale \u2014 many checks are run when people apply for gun permits, when states check on the status of gun permit holders, or for other purposes. A single background check can also represent multiple gun sales.\n\n[Related: Where The Latest COVID-19 Models Think We\u2019re Headed \u2014 And Why They Disagree]\n\nWe also don\u2019t know how many background checks from March the FBI never completed. When a background check drags on for 88 days, the bureau stops researching the potential buyer and purges the background check request from its systems to comply with federal regulations. The bureau hasn\u2019t yet released data on purged requests made in March.\n\nWe do know that the bureau never completes the overwhelming majority of background checks that take longer than three business days. For instance, 79 percent of such checks were never completed in 2019. This year, it purged over 80 percent of such checks from January and 78 percent from February.\n\nStill, Jurgen Brauer, chief economist at Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting, and other experts agree that the spike in background checks in March represented a real surge in retail gun sales. For instance, Brauer\u2019s consulting firm analysed FBI data and found that retail gun sales drove the surge in March, along with a second surge in June that was likely tied to Black Lives Matter protests. In total, the firm estimated that gun sales rose year-over-year by 85 percent in March and 145 percent in June.\n\nAnd a team of researchers at the University of California, Davis\u2019s Violence Prevention Research Program compared FBI data on gun background checks to gun violence data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, finding a nearly 8 percent increase in gun violence over expected levels from March through May 2020. This study hasn\u2019t yet been peer reviewed, but if it\u2019s accurate, that\u2019s 776 additional fatal and nonfatal injuries, not including suicides and accidents.\n\n[Related: How Americans View The Coronavirus Crisis And Trump\u2019s Response]\n\nThis surge in gun sales during the pandemic has meant that an already brittle background check system is getting overloaded, causing massive delays, according to Brauer. He compared background checks to a drainage system that backs up during a big storm. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive flow of rainwater, and the systems can\u2019t handle it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FBI, however, disputed that characterization in a statement to FiveThirtyEight.\n\nHolly Morris, a spokesperson for the bureau, said the agency hasn\u2019t found a relationship between the rise in the share of delayed background checks and the increased volume of requests. \u201cThe influx in the percentage of delayed transactions and any extended processing times can be\u200b attributed to a number of variables,\u201d Morris wrote via email, adding that staffing levels for the background check system have remained the same throughout the pandemic.\n\nThere are signs that the influx in gun sales might not be slowing anytime soon. The initial spikes in gun sales in March lined up closely with events related to the pandemic, including Feb. 26, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first confirmed that the virus was spreading within the U.S. and not just being brought back by travelers, and Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration on March 13. But as the pandemic has worn on, the reasoning driving the spike in gun sales has changed, too. By the time gun sales soared even higher in June, research suggests it was no longer the coronavirus on buyers\u2019 minds but the protests over the police killing of George Floyd.\n\n[Related: The Latest Political Polls Collected By FiveThirtyEight]\n\nPhillip Levine and Robin McKnight of Wellesley College compared the FBI\u2019s state-by-state background check data with data on Google searches for the N-word to see if states with more searches for the racist slur saw a larger increase in gun sales. They found what Levine described as a \u201cmodest correlation\u201d in June, suggesting that at least some of those sales were driven by concerns over Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\u201cAs the pandemic settled down, gun sales settled down too, until it got to June,\u201d Levine said in an interview. \u201cIn the aftermath of the George Floyd killing, there was another very dramatic spike.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how gun sales in the U.S. will continue to progress, as we don\u2019t yet have data for July. The data released to FiveThirtyEight did not include June, but less-detailed data the FBI published online shows that last month the agency ran more background checks than any other month on record. And, of course, sales rose in 2016 in part over fears that Hillary Clinton would take the White House and impose new gun regulations, so with presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden ahead in the polls, another surge in gun sales may not be far behind. Not to mention that another surge in coronavirus cases could again drive a spike in sales like the one we saw in March.\n\nWhatever happens, more gun sales will likely mean more delays \u2014 potentially putting guns into the hands of people who can\u2019t legally own one.\n\n\n\n\n\nNate Silver doesn\u2019t buy that Trump\u2019s fate is sealed, \u2018a lot could change in 100 days\u2019", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-sales-are-surging-but-background-checks-arent-keeping-up/", "author": ["Joshua Eaton"]}, {"title": "Confidence Interval: Will Biden Choose Kamala Harris As His VP?", "text": "Welcome to another episode of Confidence Interval, where we make a persuasive case for a hot take \u2026 and then reveal how confident we really feel about the idea.

Some of those bids have a better chance than others; for instance, our prediction model thinks the Dallas Mavericks and Orlando Magic have effectively zero chance of missing the playoffs, no matter how the restart goes. For the other eight teams, though, there are at least some stakes in the prelude to the postseason, even if they\u2019re mostly along for the ride.\n\n[Related: Our NBA Predictions]\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s highlight the players on those eight clubs \u2014 the Brooklyn Nets, Memphis Grizzlies, New Orleans Pelicans, Phoenix Suns, Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings, San Antonio Spurs and Washington Wizards \u2014 who rate highest this season according to our RAPTOR player ratings and who might have the biggest impact on the pre-playoff bubble action.\n\n[Related: Who\u2019s Who In The NBA Bubble: The Teams Just Along For The Ride]\n\nDamian Lillard\n\nPG, Portland Trail Blazers\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +5.9 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 12 percent\n\nWill the restart be Dame Time? RAPTOR thinks Lillard is the best player among all the playoff hopefuls, after yet another outstanding season that saw him rank sixth among all NBA players in RAPTOR wins above replacement (WAR). Despite maintaining a usage rate north of 30 percent, Lillard also set a new career high in true shooting percentage \u2014 61.9 percent \u2014 thanks in large part to his glossy conversion rates from 2-point (51.8 percent) and 3-point (39.4 percent) range. Add in a career-best assist rate of 34.1 percent, and Dame is an incredible offensive machine, even if RAPTOR considers his defense (-2.0 points/100) subpar. Lillard has been hobbled in practice with a foot injury, but reports are that he should be ready when the real games tip off \u2014 essential news for an offensive-minded Portland team trying to gun its way into the postseason.\n\nOther Blazers to watch: C Hassan Whiteside (+3.2 RAPTOR); SG CJ McCollum (+1.4)\n\nJrue Holiday\n\nSG, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +4.8 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 45 percent\n\nWhat, were you expecting Zion Williamson here? It\u2019s true that Zion has been a revelation for the Pelicans since his debut on Jan. 22, posting a RAPTOR of +2.4 points/100 in 19 games. But the rookie might not hit the ground running in the restart; he hasn\u2019t been practicing with his team over the past few weeks because of a family emergency (though he has now cleared quarantine in the bubble). And besides, Holiday has been better according to RAPTOR anyway, with a +4.8 rating per 100. That might be surprising, but Holiday has rated better than +4.0 per 100 in each of the past three seasons, making him one of the more underappreciated two-way players in the league. Only four players this season \u2014 Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard and Holiday \u2014 have a RAPTOR offensive and defensive rating of at least +2.0 points/100. And that might actually understate the breadth of Holiday\u2019s contributions, between his mix of efficient shooting from the field, low-turnover playmaking and disruptive perimeter defense. Without question, the Pels need Williamson at his best to crash the playoff party, but they also need Holiday to keep up his quiet brand of all-around excellence in order to have a chance.\n\nOther Pelicans to watch: C Derrick Favors (+3.4 RAPTOR); PF Zion Williamson (+2.4); F Brandon Ingram (+1.1)\n\n[Related: Which NBA Contracts Were Gems This Season, And Which Were Stinkers?]\n\nPatty Mills\n\nPG, San Antonio Spurs\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +3.5 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: <1 percent\n\nMills doesn\u2019t even start for San Antonio \u2014 in 63 games, his lone appearance in the opening lineup came in late November. But he has still managed to make his presence felt this season, leading San Antonio in RAPTOR WAR (4.6) despite coming off the bench. Mills has long been an unsung player for the Spurs, dating back to their dynasty days. But at age 31, the creaky veteran still scores plenty (18.5 points/36 minutes), knocking down nearly 150 3-pointers this year (at a 38 percent clip) while almost never giving the ball away (7.6 percent turnover rate). The Spurs have little chance to make the playoffs, sitting four games out of the West\u2019s No. 8 seed with four teams ahead of them and highly paid big man LaMarcus Aldridge out for the year. But they are a markedly better team with Mills on the court, evidence of his value even in a down year for coach Gregg Popovich\u2019s crew.\n\nOther Spurs to watch: C Jakob Poeltl (+3.3 RAPTOR); SG Derrick White (+2.6); SF DeMar DeRozan (+0.1)\n\nJonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas\n\nC, Memphis Grizzlies\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +2.7 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 34 percent\n\nGuard Ja Morant has had a fine debut season (1.8 WAR) and is overwhelmingly likely to win Rookie of the Year honors, but the No. 2 pick in last year\u2019s draft was not RAPTOR\u2019s pick as the best Grizzly of 2019-20. That distinction goes to Valan\u010di\u016bnas, who\u2019s enjoying an outstanding year in his second season with Memphis, posting a career-high +2.7 RAPTOR (including a +2.2 mark on defense). Valan\u010di\u016bnas has been at his hyper-efficient best all season, ranking 12th in the league in effective field-goal percentage while averaging 14.9 points and 11.2 rebounds per game and playing tough D. According to Basketball-Reference.com, Memphis\u2019s defense allowed 109.2 points/100 with Valan\u010di\u016bnas on the court, 3.0 points/100 fewer than when he sat \u2014 a big part of why Memphis is even here. (Its defense is exactly average, while its offense has been 1 point/100 worse than the league norm.) Valan\u010di\u016bnas has looked good in warmup games, so watch for more efficient play from him if the Grizz are going to hang onto the eighth seed in the West.\n\nOther Grizzlies to watch: PG De\u2019Anthony Melton (+2.5 RAPTOR); C Gorgui Dieng (+2.3); PF Brandon Clarke (+1.2); PG Ja Morant (-0.8)\n\n[Related: Who\u2019s Who In The NBA Bubble: The Inner-Circle Contenders]\n\nJarrett Allen\n\nC, Brooklyn Nets\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +1.9 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 95 percent\n\nThe Nets have been absolutely devastated by injuries, opt-outs and COVID-19 diagnoses, costing them Kyrie Irving, Spencer Dinwiddie, DeAndre Jordan, Taurean Prince and Wilson Chandler, among others. However, Brooklyn does have a couple of solid RAPTOR-rated starters left over in Allen (+1.9) and guard Caris LeVert (+1.3), plus a six-game buffer to work with over the No. 9 Washington Wizards to avoid being in danger of missing the playoffs. The 22-year-old Allen has been one of the most improved players in the NBA this season, following up a dreadful -4.3 RAPTOR in the 2018-19 regular season to post a rating 6.2 points/100 better this year. The improvement came mostly on defense, where Allen went from -2.8 to +2.5 points/100, with much better numbers in our player-tracking measures like shot defense and opposing matchup performance. Allen\u2019s offense is still negative (-0.6 points/100), but he did improve his true shooting percentage, turnover rate, offensive rebound rate and fouls drawn per 100 shots this season. In tandem with LeVert\u2019s scoring and passing skills and forward Joe Harris\u2019s shooting, Allen leaves the Nets with at least some productive options in the bubble going forward.\n\nOther Nets to watch: SG Caris LeVert (+1.3 RAPTOR); SF Joe Harris (-0.5)\n\nRicky Rubio\n\nPG, Phoenix Suns\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +1.8 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: <1 percent\n\nThe Suns have a good ensemble cast of starters, so a few of them could make a case as Phoenix\u2019s player to watch. But the team\u2019s best RAPTOR rating (+1.8) belongs to Rubio, whose arrival via free agency last summer helped the Suns improve enough to even be in this position. With Rubio on the court, the Suns score 6.7 more points/100 than when he sits, and they allow 3.3 fewer points/100 \u2014 meaning Phoenix\u2019s overall performance is about 10 points/100 better when Rubio is in the game. Why? Rubio has great chemistry with running mates Devin Booker and Kelly Oubre Jr. \u2014 two strong scorers \u2014 because he is such a good facilitator, leading the team in assist rate (39.9 percent), and his ability to draw fouls makes him an efficient fallback option on offense. Defensively, Rubio\u2019s RAPTOR has slipped some this year (from +1.2 last regular season to +0.1 points/100), but he still ranks among the league leaders in steal rate (2.3 percent), long one of the \u201chidden\u201d ways Rubio\u2019s value exceeds his reputation.\n\nOther Suns to watch: SF Mikal Bridges (+1.7 RAPTOR); SG Devin Booker (+1.0); C Deandre Ayton (+0.8); SF Kelly Oubre Jr. \u2014 if healthy (+0.6)\n\n[Related: Who\u2019s Who In The NBA Bubble: The Potential Party-Crashers]\n\nRichaun Holmes\n\nC, Sacramento Kings\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +1.5 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 9 percent\n\nHolmes isn\u2019t exactly a household name, but in the restart, he\u2019ll lead a crop of six Kings who have played at least 1,000 minutes with a positive RAPTOR this season. Holmes had spent the previous four years of his NBA career carving out a niche as a shot-blocking big man with good finishing ability around the rim, but this year he\u2019s upgraded his rating from -1.3 to +1.5 points/100 \u2014 a huge improvement. Fueling the change has been a career-best true shooting percentage (fifth-best in the league) and slightly expanded shooting range, plus improved defensive numbers in terms of both RAPTOR\u2019s on-versus-off court and player-tracking categories. Before the season was put on hold, Holmes had just returned from an injury that sidelined him from early January into March; now he should be one of the best-kept secrets of the playoff chase, even if his Kings are up against long odds to snag the No. 8 seed and extend their season.\n\nOther Kings to watch: PF Nemanja Bjelica (+0.8 RAPTOR); PG De\u2019Aaron Fox (+0.6); SG Bogdan Bogdanovic (+0.3); SG Buddy Hield (+0.2)\n\nIsaac Bonga\n\nSF, Washington Wizards\n\nRAPTOR plus/minus: +1.2 points/100 possessions\n\nTeam playoff odds: 5 percent\n\nWith high-scoring guard Bradley Beal (+1.5 RAPTOR) sitting with a shoulder injury and efficient forward D\u0101vis Bert\u0101ns (+2.4) opting out of the bubble, the Wizards are running low on decently rated players for the restart. According to RAPTOR, their only above-average guys left are center Moritz Wagner (+0.6), who has logged just 707 minutes this season, and Bonga (+1.2), who may prove to be Washington\u2019s under-the-radar MVP if it manages to overcome the Nets or Magic to make the playoffs. Bonga doesn\u2019t produce big numbers; he\u2019s averaging just 4.6 points per game this season. But he is efficient with what chances he gets \u2014 producing 121.4 points per 100 possessions he personally ends \u2014 and he\u2019s been stellar when he gets corner threes, on which he\u2019s gone 11-for-23 this season. On defense, Bonga creates havoc with both steals and blocks, and the Wizards play more like a competent NBA defense with him on the court, a huge bonus for the league\u2019s worst defensive team.\n\nOther Wizards to watch: C Moritz Wagner (+0.6 RAPTOR); PG Shabazz Napier (-0.1); C Ian Mahinmi (-0.1)\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-players-to-watch-on-the-nba-teams-just-trying-to-hang-around/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "How The NHL\u2019s New Format Changed The Stanley Cup Race", "text": "On Saturday, the NHL joins the ranks of sports returning to action, with 24 teams plotting out one of the strangest paths to the Stanley Cup in hockey history.\n\nLike the NBA, the NHL season will restart in a \u201cbubble,\u201d with early games split between two \u201chub\u201d sites: Toronto (for the Eastern Conference) and Edmonton (for the West). Also like its basketball-playing cousins, hockey will have a bit of a convoluted format upon its return. Each conference\u2019s top four teams will play a round-robin tournament (under regular-season rules) for playoff seeding, while the other eight teams from each conference have a best-of-five series (under playoff rules) to determine who reaches the Round of 16.\n\n[Related: A Home Playoff Game Is A Big Advantage \u2014 Unless You Play Hockey]\n\nFrom there, though, the playoffs will look roughly the same as usual, aside from reseeding after every round and a lack of crowds or home-ice advantage \u2014 which isn\u2019t worth much in hockey anyway \u2014 for anyone except the Maple Leafs and Oilers. So with the playoffs set to begin, I wanted to see how much the Stanley Cup picture has changed since the last time players took the ice, on March 11. Using Hockey-Reference.com\u2019s Simple Rating System (SRS) for each team \u2014 and a set of logistic regressions relating SRS to win probabilities for games under rules for both the regular season and the postseason \u2014 I programmed 10,000 simulations for the rest of the season and playoffs under two scenarios: if the season had played out as planned back in March and under the current expanded format.\n\nBefore the break, the Stanley Cup favorites (according to SRS) were the Boston Bruins (13 percent), Colorado Avalanche (12 percent), Tampa Bay Lightning (11 percent), St. Louis Blues (9 percent), Philadelphia Flyers (8 percent), Washington Capitals (7 percent) and Vegas Golden Knights (6 percent). Under the new system, those seven are still the front-runners, with essentially the same odds \u2014 except Boston dropped to 12 percent and Tampa Bay moved up to 12 percent. So in that sense, the big picture of the playoffs hasn\u2019t changed much.\n\nCup favorites, then and now Most likely 2019-20 NHL champions under original* and new playoff systems Original System New System Rk Team Prob.

The Arizona Coyotes (whose Cup chances rose by 1.3 percentage points) and New York Rangers (up 0.8 points) saw their odds increase because both are reasonably good teams by SRS \u2014 each ranks in the league\u2019s top half \u2014 that had relatively long playoff odds beforehand, but now can potentially do damage in the expanded bracket. Others, such as the Montreal Canadiens and Chicago Blackhawks, watched their Cup odds go up mainly because they had next to no shot at making the playoffs under the standard system; now, the qualifying series gives each a fighting chance. And the Dallas Stars\u2019 probability went up because they are the fourth seed in the West \u2014 meaning they can avoid the qualifying round entirely and skip straight to the Round of 16, despite ranking among the league\u2019s bottom half in SRS.\n\nHow did Cup odds shift under the new playoff format?

As an example, the Pittsburgh Penguins rank eighth in SRS and possess plenty of star power \u2014 when healthy \u2014 but also finished 3 points behind the rival Flyers for the fourth-best record in the East. That means Pittsburgh must play an extra series \u2014 with just a 59 percent chance of winning it \u2014 to even make it into the Round of 16, despite having a 98 percent chance to get that far before the pause. Even though the Pens will play the Canadiens, who are tied with the Columbus Blue Jackets for the lowest SRS of any team in the restart field, Pittsburgh is a clear victim of the NHL\u2019s modified playoff system.\n\nWhose playoff odds improved under the new format?

All three of those teams \u2014 Edmonton, Carolina and Pittsburgh \u2014 would see their Cup odds double if they do survive the qualifying round.)\n\n[Related: Apparently The Regular Season Is Irrelevant In The NHL]\n\nThis effect could also hurt Canadian teams\u2019 chances of winning the Stanley Cup for the first time since 1993. Although Montreal was among the biggest beneficiaries of the amended format, Canada\u2019s other postseason entries all saw their odds of mounting a deep playoff run drop, some significantly. (This despite Canada hosting the entire restart, with two of its teams \u2014 Toronto and Edmonton \u2014 having at least some extra familiarity by playing in their home facilities.) Overall, the six Canadian teams in the restart \u2014 sorry, Ottawa \u2014 are, on average, 10 percentage points less likely to make the Round of 16, 5 percentage points less likely to make the conference semifinals, 3 percentage points less likely to make the conference finals and 1 percentage point less likely to make the Cup Final now than if the season had been allowed to play out normally.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of one of the teams hurt by the change in format, though, these playoffs should be as exciting and compelling as ever. Can the defending-champion Blues keep beating the odds? Can the Bruins avenge last year\u2019s Game 7 defeat? Can the Lightning find redemption after their historic 2019 collapse? Or will one of the nonfavorites crash the party, because it\u2019s hockey? All of those storylines are why, despite months of waiting and a byzantine new playoff format (as per the NHL\u2019s typical style), the battle for the 2020 Cup still promises to be a good one.\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-nhls-new-format-changed-the-stanley-cup-race/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "Forget Norms. Our Democracy Depends On Values.", "text": "President Trump this week tweeted his intention to order the Department of Justice to investigate whether the FBI had \u201cinfiltrated\u201d the Trump campaign for political purposes. He then met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray to push the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. The episode, like many before it, set off alarms among legal and political commentators. Throughout the 2016 campaign, the outsider candidate demonstrated that he would not be bound by the usual unwritten rules of the game. Political scientists, in particular, have emphasized the decline of \u201cnorms\u201d in their efforts to explain the danger posed by the Trump administration and the president\u2019s possible role in the decline of liberal democracy in the U.S.\n\nBut as with any word that has picked up heavy traction in political discussions, \u201cnorms\u201d has gotten a bit imprecise. What do we actually mean when we talk about norms? Why do such informal rules exist? And what norm violations should we really care about?\n\nWhy we need norms\n\nInformal rules tend to emerge around things that we are anxious or doubtful about. Think about social manners. We have norms against cutting in line or eating all the cake at a birthday party precisely because humans don\u2019t seem to be naturally inclined to be generous. We have to be taught to be considerate of other people and socially sanctioned into doing so.\n\nThis principle turns out to be especially applicable to presidential politics. Presidential power is vaguely defined in the Constitution, and the office is designed in a way that allows for very broad use of power. Presidents can make decisions about how to conduct foreign policy, fire executive branch officials who don\u2019t do what they want, and make policy by executive order.\n\nBecause the executive branch concentrates substantial power and influence in a single person, there are plenty of opportunities for those powers to become political weapons \u2014 if they\u2019re left unchecked. In \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt describe norms as guarding against just that, as preventing institutions from being used as \u201cpolitical weapons.\u201d We have norms about when and how presidents use their \u201cbully pulpit,\u201d for example, as well as when they should use their power to fire executive branch officials.\n\nWhy do we have informal rules (norms) about some things and formal rules (laws and regulations) about other things? One answer that Jennifer Smith and I developed in our research on the topic is that informal rules emerge when there\u2019s some agreement that a rule needs to exist but deep disagreement on the particulars. One example of this is the norm established in the country\u2019s early years that presidents would serve only two terms. There was widespread agreement that there should be limits on how long a single person could hold the presidency. But there were enough objections to any specific time span to make it difficult to put a formal rule in place. Making formal term limits would have forced a difficult conversation about exactly how long presidents should serve and about whether the limits on public accountability were worth it. Adopting an informal rule allowed the country to skip these more difficult conversations and instead just follow George Washington\u2019s lead. (Of course, it took only one violation of this informal rule \u2014 FDR\u2019s four terms \u2014 to push things over the edge for a more formal change, and that happened only after the country had grown used to the informal two-term convention.)\n\nWhen we should actually care about norm violations\n\nOK, we really need norms. But we don\u2019t need all norms equally. In the Trump era, norms are invoked with dizzying frequency, and Trump won the White House while violating all sorts of unwritten rules of campaigning. So which norms should we really try to protect?\n\nIn short, some norms are more cosmetic and about tradition and convention, and some norms are really about \u201cdemocratic values.\u201d We care about the latter.\n\nHow can we tell which is which? Three categories of norms about presidential behavior tap into crucial aspects of democracy: respecting the independence of other institutions, acknowledging that political conflict is part of the process, and keeping private profit separate from government operations.\n\nIndependence of other institutions \u2014 American politics depends on the independence of the three formal branches of the national government. So any action that erodes that independence is worth worrying about. Of course, autonomy across branches has been a tricky subject. Presidents obviously try to influence Congress and even sometimes congressional primaries. Members of Congress try to influence presidential elections. You might remember the Supreme Court getting involved in a presidential election. Because interbranch meddling has such a long history, norms may be a less powerful guideline than thinking about whether the president is trying to do something that will weaken the ability of other branches to challenge him.\n\nPolitical conflict \u2014 Let\u2019s see if we can thread this needle. First, the idea of legitimate opposition \u2014 that people can oppose and criticize the government without posing a threat to the nation \u2014 is a fundamental tenet of democracy. Trump\u2019s violation of that norm has primarily taken the form of tweets about the media and about his Democratic opponents. Journalists and opposition party members have very different roles to play here, and the implications of presidential criticism is different for each. Efforts to delegitimize criticism of the president by the media are alarming (well, I might have a bit of a vested interest here), as are threats to jail opponents. Attacks on congressional Democrats, however nasty, may violate norms of civility but don\u2019t necessarily threaten core democratic values.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s the peaceful resolution of political disagreement \u2014 not the absence of dissenting views \u2014 that\u2019s central to democracy. Corey Robin points out that sometimes norms are actually quite repressive, such as the informal rules and expectations that allowed American slavery to persist in the 19th century until the abolitionists \u201cpolarized society.\u201d It\u2019s the criminalizing of political dissent \u2014 either by attacking the opposition or denying its standing \u2014 that should be worrying.\n\nPublic and private \u2014 Since Trump won the 2016 election, there have been numerous examples of his family\u2019s private business interests becoming intertwined with government operations. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway drew criticism for advertising Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing brand during a televised interview. The real estate dealings of the Trump Organization across the globe have made critics nervous. Trump\u2019s hotels and resorts have become part of official state and government business, making it difficult to separate the president\u2019s private business interests from the work of governing. These potential conflicts of interest have thus far attracted many questions and at least one lawsuit. This kind of behavior is constrained through a mix of formal and informal rules. Thus far, it\u2019s proved difficult to rein in, despite widespread agreement that public officials should not profit from their positions.\n\nThinking more carefully and precisely about norms might actually lead us to more pessimistic conclusions about the risks to U.S. democracy. We depend a great deal on informal rules to constrain the presidency, both because of the powerful nature of the office and because it\u2019s difficult to find agreement about the kinds of formal rules that would limit presidential power. Much of the time when we\u2019re talking about norm violations, we don\u2019t so much mean a departure from standard practice as a breach in democratic principles. The ability to adopt informal rules has sometimes saved Americans from hard conversations about power and the tradeoffs that democracy requires. Those are exactly the kinds of hard conversations we might need to have now.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/forget-norms-our-democracy-depends-on-values/", "author": ["Julia Azari"]}, {"title": "How Biden\u2019s VP Pick Could Shape Perceptions Of The Ticket Overall", "text": "How Biden\u2019s VP Pick Could Shape Perceptions Of The Ticket Overall\n\nIn this week\u2019s FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, the crew discusses the upsides and downsides of Joe Biden\u2019s choices for a running mate.

Will Hurd of Texas\u2019s 23rd Congressional District. And as you\u2019ll hear in the podcast and read in selected excerpts below, we covered a lot of ground, including whether Hurd will vote for President Trump in November.\n\nThe transcript below has been lightly edited.\n\nOn whether Hurd will vote for Trump:\n\nGalen Druke: I want to talk about all that strategy and what the future of the party looks like. But are you going to vote for Trump this fall?\n\nWill Hurd: Like a lot of Americans, I wish I had different options on the ballot. And my plan is always to support a Republican and we\u2019re going to be making those decisions over the next 98 days.\n\nGD: So you\u2019re going to decide whether or not to vote for him over the next 98 days?\n\nWH: That is how I always approach my election. I\u2019m just like everybody else.\n\nGD: Well, you previously said that you will vote for Trump this fall. So I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re hesitant a little bit now?\n\nWH: I think that\u2019s accurate.\n\nYour polling is showing that. I\u2019m like everybody else. I don\u2019t want to vote for a Joe Biden because in the end, some of the policies, I think that a unified Democratic Party is going to pass \u2026 would be tough for the country, and things that I don\u2019t support, and haven\u2019t supported during my time in Congress. And as somebody who\u2019s represented a large, competitive district, I know something about competitive districts and what needs to be done in order to win.\n\nGD: I understand that desire not to vote for Joe Biden, but I guess more specifically on whether or not you\u2019ll vote for Trump, what could change your mind in the next 98 days that would make you view him and his presidency differently than what he\u2019s shown us so far?\n\nWH: It\u2019s a good question and who knows. I don\u2019t think a year ago we would have been thinking about a global pandemic that would have impacted the entire world and brought the world economy to a standstill. And so who knows what can happen over these next few weeks.\n\nBut in the end, what I think that I\u2019ve been trying to preach to my colleagues is that we have to change as a Republican Party. We have to start appealing to broader groups of people. And if we don\u2019t, and also if the Republican Party doesn\u2019t start looking like America, we\u2019re not going to have a Republican Party in America.\n\nGD: Everything you\u2019re saying here makes it sound like you aren\u2019t voting for Trump. Is that the case?\n\nWH: As I said, I don\u2019t like either one of my choices. And in the end, we\u2019re going to evaluate this over the next 90 days, or 96 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nRep. Will Hurd on whether he\u2019ll vote for Trump l FiveThirtyEight\n\nOn delaying the election:\n\nGD: President Trump suggested delaying the presidential election, which Congress has the power to do, your branch of government. Do you support delaying the election?\n\nWH: We are not an authoritarian government where the head of state gets to decide on a whim when an election happens. So no, this is Congress\u2019s role, as you said. It should go forward as has been established. And ultimately, look, I\u2019m of the opinion that we should be increasing the ways for people to vote, right, the more people that vote, the better off it is. And this is something that I\u2019ve been able to prove, during my time in Congress, that if you take a message to more people, you can get it to resonate with more people and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep. Will Hurd On President Trump\u2019s Suggestion To Delay The Election\n\nOn the U.S. response to COVID-19:\n\nGD: Overall, do you think the country is doing a good job combating the pandemic?\n\nWH: No. We have increasing death rates, right? We have the most number of people that are dealing with this right? I think the impact it\u2019s had on the United States of America versus other countries is still \u2026 we\u2019re dealing with one of the worst cases. We\u2019re having debates on whether you should be wearing a mask or not. Wear a mask! Right? A mask is to protect yourself but also to protect the people around you. So why are we debating that? This debate and fights around whether school should open or not \u2014 we should be talking about, \u2018how do we work together in order to exceed CDC guidelines on opening schools?\u2019, not whether or not it should happen.\n\nAnd so yeah, there are all kinds of problems. But I\u2019m always trying to work with these folks to deal with the problem as it is right now. I know in Texas, a third of the deaths of coronavirus have been in nursing homes. That\u2019s outrageous. And then also in prisons. And so if we couldn\u2019t handle this in nursing homes or in prisons, how are we going to be handling it in an educational environment where it is even more chaotic than those other places? So yeah, we have a long way to go.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep. Will Hurd On How The U.S. Is Doing On COVID-19\n\nOn the future of the Republican party:\n\nGD: Let\u2019s talk about where the Republican Party is headed. You said that the Republican Party needs to look more like America. And you know, right now, it doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re the only Black lawmaker on the Republican side in the House. Why do you think there are so few Black lawmakers in the Republican caucus in the house?\n\nWH: Everybody asked me when I first got elected, how does a Black Republican represent a 71 percent Latino district? And I say it\u2019s because you know, I work hard and I show up to communities that had never seen a Republican show up, and you do that multiple times. If you\u2019re showing up 90 days before an election, that\u2019s called pandering.\n\nYou have to be in those communities. Showing up is half the battle. And unfortunately, I think over time, professional political consultants talk about focusing on your likely \u201cx voter\u201d \u2014 whether that\u2019s a Republican primary voter or Democratic primary voter \u2014 rather than trying to grow and appeal to a broader group of people. It\u2019s hard.\n\nGD: Do you think that part of the reason has to do with Republicans actively appealing to a white identity?\n\nWH: Look, I think when you look at a person like a Steve King \u2014 and you know Steve King losing his primary is ultimately a good thing \u2014 but when you know folks that that have been elected as a Republican that say racist or misogynistic or homophobic things, that hurts all of us that identify with with being a Republican.\n\n\u2026 But what I found is that\u2019s not everybody. But yeah, over time, have those things been said? Yes. And Does that hurt? Yes. And that\u2019s why we have to speak out when those things do happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nGOP Rep.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. New registrations have fallen off a cliff.\n\nThe spring of a presidential election year is often a busy time for adding new voters to the rolls, and a recent report from the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonprofit organization that aims to improve voter turnout and election security, shows registration numbers were even stronger in early 2020 than early 2016. But things changed dramatically in March, at least in the 12 places where FiveThirtyEight or CEIR were able to obtain data on new voters, a category that includes first-time voters, voters who recently moved to the state and, in some states (Texas, for example) even voters who moved between counties in the state.\n\nConsider Florida, for example, where 109,859 new voters registered in February of this year, compared to 87,351 registrants in February of 2016. But in April 2020, only 21,031 new voters registered, compared with 52,508 in 2016. The same pattern holds in 10 other states, plus Washington, D.C.: Each one registered fewer new voters in April 2020 than in April 2016, including in states where online voter registration is available.\n\nCurrently, 39 states plus Washington, D.C., offer the ability to register to vote online, and a 40th (Oklahoma) is expected to implement it this year. However, in the three places for which we have the relevant data (Florida, Maryland and Washington), online voter registration has not taken off during the pandemic \u2014 certainly not enough to make up for the lost in-person registrations. Even in Washington, where online registrations have ticked up since the beginning of the year, the pace is comparable to 2016: 2,956 people registered online in April and May 2020, similar to the 2,771 people who registered online in April and May 2016.\n\nThe fact that new voter registrations were outpacing the 2016 numbers in January and February was predictable, according to David Becker, the executive director and founder of CEIR. For one thing, population growth means that voter registration always climbs a bit, he said. The expansion of automatic voter registration makes getting on the rolls more convenient than ever in many states, too. Voters were also clearly interested in registering, Becker said.\n\n\u201cEvery piece of data we had looked at with regard to enthusiasm about engaging in this presidential election cycle indicated that we had to be prepared for the highest-turnout presidential election that almost anyone living had ever seen,\u201d Becker said, \u201cwhich makes the decline in March and especially April all the more striking.\u201d\n\nBased on the timing, it seems safe to assume that COVID-19 had something to do with the drop-off, but there\u2019s data to back that assumption up, too. In addition to how many new voters register, some states track how these new voters get their name on the books. In 2016 and in the pre-pandemic months of 2020, in-person registration at places like departments of motor vehicles made up a large plurality, or even a majority, of new registrants in the four places for which we have data on how new voters are registering. But after the pandemic caused most states to shutter many government offices, those registrations dwindled. By contrast, remote registrations (e.g., online or by mail) held relatively steady.\n\n\u201cThis is completely expected, but very concerning,\u201d said Wendy Weiser, director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s School of Law. \u201cThe coronavirus shut down most of the primary avenues through which Americans register to vote: government offices, and all the malls, theaters and public places where voter registration drives operate.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the closing of schools and public events like festivals has hindered in-person voter registration drives run by third-party organizations. \u201cWe had planned to go to 850 high schools leading up to graduation, but as schools closed, that work was clearly disrupted,\u201d said Jeanette Senecal, a senior director for the League of Women Voters who focuses on voter education.\n\nFor example, in Florida, third-party organizations registered 14,144 voters in January 2020 \u2014 a huge increase from the 1,196 they registered in January 2016. But in April 2020, they registered only 133 voters \u2014 down from 3,806 in April 2016.\n\nStates and third-party groups can still get around social distancing restrictions to get more voters on the poll books, though. Voto Latino, an organization that works to register and encourage Latino Americans to vote, has been operating digitally almost since its inception and was well prepared to continue its work during a pandemic. It uses digital campaigns to help voters register, which can even work in states like Texas, which does not have online voter registration \u2014 Voto Latino created an app that makes it easy to fill out the required form, which is then emailed to the voter to print off and mail in.\n\nDanny Turkel, the communications manager for Voto Latino, said the group has actually seen a surge in voter registration, especially since protests in response to the killing of George Floyd began. \u201cOur original goal entering 2020 was to register 500,000 voters,\u201d said Turkel. \u201cAs the numbers have come in and surged, we are now thinking that we could surpass 500,000.\u201d\n\nSo what kind of people might have registered if the coronavirus hadn\u2019t struck? Well for one thing, they\u2019re probably disproportionately young. \u201cIn any given year, far more young people register than older people, just because 18-year-olds age in [to being able to vote] and young people are more likely to move\u201d and need to register at a new address, said Kevin Morris, a quantitative researcher focusing on voting rights and elections at the Brennan Center. According to Morris\u2019s data, 57 percent of new registrants in Florida in the first four months of 2016 were under the age of 40, as were 65 percent of new registrants in Georgia. While the proportions were similar in the beginning of 2020, the total number was much lower than in the past, which means that lots of young people aren\u2019t registering as usual in at least two key 2020 swing states.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew voter registrations have nosedived during COVID-19\n\nSome of these delayed registrants may never end up registering at all. Though we don\u2019t have data for how a pandemic has affected registration in the past (since the U.S. hasn\u2019t faced a similar situation for a good century), Weiser cited another instance when voter registration dipped due to extenuating circumstances. In May of 2011, Florida passed a new bill that placed tough restrictions on third-party voter registration organizations, prompting many of them, such as the League of Women Voters, to stop operating in the state. The restrictions were suspended by a judge in May 2012 but the damage had been done; a subsequent study found that about 14 percent fewer voters registered in 2011 compared to the same period in 2007, with a notable drop following the introduction of the bill \u2014 and those registrations never completely caught up. In 2008, more than 1 million new voters registered in Florida. In 2012, fewer than 900,000 did, according to the state\u2019s voter registration data.\n\nOf course, one unusual law in Florida isn\u2019t exactly analogous to a pandemic, and it\u2019s possible that the high level of enthusiasm for this election will be enough to close the gap that COVID-19 created, especially as states begin to reopen and voters return to registration sites like the DMV. So it\u2019s difficult to know whether this drop in registrations is permanent. But it is clear that despite voters\u2019 intense interest in this election, the coronavirus has already made it harder for new voters to participate in it.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-registrations-are-way-way-down-during-the-pandemic", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers", "Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "It\u2019s Time To Give Basketball\u2019s Other GOAT Her Due", "text": "ESPN recently finished airing a 10-part documentary, \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d that gave Michael Jordan the last word on his career narrative, solidifying his place atop the NBA\u2019s GOAT hierarchy.

But she was often overshadowed by teammates Cheryl Miller and Pam and Paula McGee, all of whom were named All-Americans (an honor Cooper-Dyke never received) as part of a dominating Trojans team that went 114-15, won two championships and visited another NCAA final during Cooper-Dyke\u2019s career.\n\nMiller was often regarded as the Michael Jordan of women\u2019s basketball by the time she finished her storied career, and Cooper-Dyke sometimes chafed in her shadow. \u201cThere was always this friction/competition between Cheryl and I,\u201d Cooper-Dyke said in \u201cWomen of Troy,\u201d an HBO documentary about USC\u2019s \u201980s dynasty. \u201cI think she had something to prove, and I definitely had a chip on my shoulder having to prove to her and everyone watching that, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m kind of talented too.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Cooper-Dyke\u2019s skills were evident even then, particularly when she was named to the NCAA\u2019s All-Tournament team in 1986 after averaging 19.0 points per game on 54.3 percent shooting during USC\u2019s journey to the championship game.\n\nBecause of the lack of professional opportunities for women\u2019s players at the time \u2014 the WNBA wouldn\u2019t exist for another 11 years after Cooper-Dyke left college \u2014 Cooper-Dyke had to play in Europe, bouncing between teams in Spain and Italy for a decade while producing some incredible stats along the way. In her lone season with Samoa Betera, for instance, Cooper-Dyke led the Spanish league in scoring with 45 points per game, according to her autobiography. She had unlocked a part of her game that had been lurking under the surface at USC.\n\n\u201cI was pumped,\u201d Cooper-Dyke wrote. \u201cNot only was it my first professional experience, but it was the first time I had been a go-to player. I finally had my first real opportunity to showcase my talent. I was ready to shout \u2014 \u2018Hey! Look at me. I\u2019m on the scene.\u2019\u201d\n\nCooper-Dyke would go on to lead her league in scoring eight times during her 10 years overseas, never finishing any lower than second. She also won a variety of gold medals for Team USA, including at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. By the beginning of 1997, when the was WNBA preparing a list of players for its inaugural allocation draft, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s exploits in Europe were enough put her in the initial group of 16 franchise players used to seed the league\u2019s eight teams \u2014 along with superstars such as Lisa Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes, Teresa Weatherspoon and Rebecca Lobo.\n\nSubscribe to our sports podcast, Hot Takedown\n\nStill, Cooper-Dyke was somewhat unknown to American fans on the eve of the WNBA\u2019s debut. \u201cNobody was following what was going on overseas, but she was dominating the Italian league, [she was] the leading scorer, won championships,\u201d Hall of Famer Ticha Penicheiro said in a WNBA feature on Cooper-Dyke. \u201cPeople just didn\u2019t know about her.\u201d\n\nThat changed in a hurry during the WNBA\u2019s initial season. Cooper-Dyke was instantly and obviously the new league\u2019s best player: She won MVP honors while leading the Comets to the league\u2019s best record and the first-ever WNBA championship. She also swept the league\u2019s advanced-stats leaderboard, finishing No. 1 in player efficiency rating, win shares and win shares per 40 minutes. According to a composite mix of PER and WS/40 designed to mimic our RAPTOR NBA ratings, Cooper-Dyke added 10.6 points per 100 possessions more than average to Houston\u2019s league-leading +8.7 net rating, carrying the Comets while Swoopes missed the majority of the season after giving birth to her son.\n\nCooper-Dyke did it all at 34, too \u2014 well past the prime age for basketball players. It makes you wonder what feats she might have accomplished if the WNBA had existed just a decade earlier. And as great as Cooper-Dyke was in the WNBA\u2019s first season, she was even better in Year 2. In 1998, she once again:\n\nWith apologies to recent accomplishments of Elena Delle Donne and Nneka Ogwumike, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s 1998 may have been the best single-season performance in WNBA history. In terms of composite rating, it trails only Lauren Jackson\u2019s 2006 among seasons of at least 375 minutes:\n\nCooper-Dyke\u2019s early WNBA seasons are among the best ever Best single-season composite ratings \u2014 based on a mix of player efficiency rating (PER) and win shares per 40 minutes \u2014 for WNBA players who played at least 375 minutes that season, 1997-2019 Player Season Age Team PER WS/40 Composite Rating Lauren Jackson 2006 25 SEA 34.7 .416 +11.5 Cynthia Cooper 1998 35 HOU 31.1 .382 +10.7 Cynthia Cooper 1997 34 HOU 32.2 .385 +10.6 Sheryl Swoopes 2000 29 HOU 32.0 .361 +10.5 Lauren Jackson 2007 26 SEA 35.0 .373 +10.4 Nneka Ogwumike 2016 25 LAS 31.3 .370 +10.3 Sylvia Fowles 2017 31 MIN 30.8 .350 +10.0 Elena Delle Donne 2019 29 WAS 31.8 .343 +9.9 Elena Delle Donne 2015 25 CHI 32.8 .346 +9.4 Lauren Jackson 2003 22 SEA 32.1 .333 +9.2 Cynthia Cooper 1999 36 HOU 29.5 .335 +9.2 Yolanda Griffith 1999 29 SAC 31.9 .330 +9.1 Lauren Jackson 2010 29 SEA 27.9 .333 +8.8 Tamika Catchings 2007 27 IND 29.4 .325 +8.6 Nneka Ogwumike 2017 26 LAS 28.1 .321 +8.5 Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nJackson didn\u2019t play as much as Cooper-Dyke did, and Jackson\u2019s team didn\u2019t have nearly as much success in 2006 as Houston did in 1998. Cooper-Dyke\u2019s performance came while logging 35 minutes per game for a team that still holds the record for highest single-season winning percentage (.900) in league history. That season, Cooper-Dyke had as thorough a stranglehold on the WNBA as MJ ever had on the NBA in any of his seasons. (And again, she did it at the ripe old age of 35!)\n\nIn 1999, Cooper-Dyke was still dominant, leading the league in win shares (overall and per 40) and composite rating \u2014 although Sacramento\u2019s Yolanda Griffith wrested away the PER crown and MVP honors. The Comets won their third consecutive WNBA title, however, with Cooper-Dyke once again earning Finals MVP honors. It continued a Jordanesque stretch that helped solidify Cooper-Dyke\u2019s place in history as the WNBA\u2019s GOAT.\n\nAnd then, in 2000, the Comets had the most impressive run in the history of women\u2019s pro basketball.\n\nAt age 37, Cooper-Dyke\u2019s individual stats were beginning to decline. She ranked third on the team in composite rating (+6.3) behind Swoopes (+10.5) \u2014 who had fully come into her own as a dominating superstar, winning MVP honors \u2014 and Tina Thompson (+6.5). But the 2000 Comets were the best version of their dynasty teams. After a 27-5 regular season, Houston blazed through the playoffs without losing a single game, as Cooper-Dyke won Finals MVP for a fourth consecutive season with 22.5 points and 6 assists per game against the New York Liberty.\n\nWe can measure Houston\u2019s rise from a new team to a legendary four-time WNBA champion using Elo ratings, a FiveThirtyEight staple. Before each game, Elo assigns each team a rating that essentially represents their current strength; those ratings (after incorporating home-court advantage and other factors) can be turned into win probabilities for both teams. After the game, the ratings are then adjusted based on the result, with the winner gaining Elo points in proportion to how unexpected the victory was. This spring, my colleague Jay Boice created Elo ratings for the WNBA, which follow the same general framework as our other Elo ratings from the NBA and other sports.\n\nAccording to Elo, the 2000 Houston Comets peaked with a rating of 1743 after completing their sweep of the Liberty, which, even two decades later, is still the highest rating ever achieved by a WNBA team.\n\nSadly, the Comets no longer exist, having folded in 2008. But their legacy as the GOAT lives on. The closest any recent WNBA teams have come to matching the Comets\u2019 peak Elo were the 2014 Phoenix Mercury, who topped out at 1736 after sweeping the Sky for the championship, and the 2017 Los Angeles Sparks, who reached a 1729 Elo when they took a 2-1 lead over the Minnesota Lynx in the Finals. (L.A. would go on to lose its next two games \u2014 and the series.) Delle Donne\u2019s 2019 Washington Mystics were the best offensive team in WNBA history, but in terms of Elo, their peak was just 1717, nowhere near the Comets\u2019 best mark.\n\nIn retrospect, Houston was lucky to have randomly drawn both Cooper-Dyke and Swoopes in the WNBA\u2019s initial allocation draft, and then to have taken Thompson No. 1 overall in the regular 1997 draft \u2014 it instantly gave the Comets a trio of all-time legends from the very start. With all three playing to their full potential, surrounded by solid role players like Janeth Arcain, Kim Perrot and Monica Lamb, it\u2019s no wonder that Houston blossomed into a historic dynasty.\n\nBut at the center of it all was Cooper-Dyke, who retired after that 2000 season at the top of the basketball world (before making a brief, four-game comeback in 2003). To this day, she remains the WNBA\u2019s all-time leader in PER (28.7), win shares per 40 (.335) and composite rating (+9.0), with Jackson and Delle Donne distantly tied behind her at +7.3. Statistically, Cooper-Dyke is the best ever on a per-possession basis, and it isn\u2019t particularly close:\n\nCooper-Dyke dominated each and every possession Best composite ratings \u2014 based on a mix of player efficiency rating (PER) and win shares per 40 minutes \u2014 for WNBA players with at least 2,250 career minutes played, 1997-2019 Player Games Minutes PER WS/40 Composite Rating Cynthia Cooper 124 4,363 28.7 .335 +9.0 Elena Delle Donne 190 5,900 28.7 .289 +7.3 Lauren Jackson 317 10,130 28.0 .288 +7.3 Nneka Ogwumike 250 7,309 25.8 .267 +6.4 Yolanda Griffith 311 8,956 25.4 .265 +6.3 Tamika Catchings 457 14,387 26.1 .260 +6.1 Jonquel Jones 136 3,126 25.0 .254 +6.0 Maya Moore 271 8,466 24.6 .253 +6.0 Sylvia Fowles 340 10,387 25.2 .240 +5.6 Breanna Stewart 101 3,339 25.3 .225 +5.2 Candace Parker 315 9,836 25.3 .216 +4.9 Liz Cambage 117 2,910 26.5 .207 +4.7 Brittney Griner 212 6,481 24.8 .213 +4.7 Lisa Leslie 363 11,634 24.3 .206 +4.6 Sheryl Swoopes 324 10,591 23.3 .212 +4.5 Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nCooper-Dyke is the only four-time (or even three-time) Finals MVP in league history, and she is still the only back-to-back league MVP winner. She led the greatest dynasty in WNBA history, rising from a relative unknown plying her trade in Europe to become the top player in women\u2019s hoops.\n\nIt\u2019s a great story. In fact, now that Jordan\u2019s film is in the books, and once they finish telling Tom Brady\u2019s tale, maybe Cooper-Dyke should be the subject of ESPN\u2019s next documentary about GOAT athletes.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/its-time-to-give-basketballs-other-goat-her-due/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "We\u2019ve Updated Our Pollster Ratings Ahead Of The 2020 General Election", "text": "The competitive phase of the 2020 presidential primaries is over \u2014 which means we\u2019ve updated FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings. These ratings cover this year\u2019s presidential primaries, the 2019 gubernatorial elections and the occasional straggler poll we only just discovered from a past election. They include polls conducted in the final 21 days before every presidential, U.S. Senate, U.S. House and gubernatorial general election (including special elections), as well as every presidential primary, since 1998. We encourage you to check out the new ratings, especially when a new poll comes out and you want to gauge its reliability.\n\nSo far, it hasn\u2019t been a great year for pollsters. The 2020 presidential primary polls had a weighted average error \u2014 i.e., the absolute difference between a poll\u2019s margin (between the top two candidates) and the actual vote share margin \u2014 of 10.2 percentage points. That\u2019s roughly tied with the 2016 presidential primaries for the biggest error in primary polling this century.\n\nBut we don\u2019t blame pollsters too much for this: They have some good excuses because the 2020 Democratic primary race changed so quickly. In the span of a week (from roughly Feb. 25 to Super Tuesday), former Vice President Joe Biden dramatically reversed his electoral fortunes, and surveys just weren\u2019t able to keep up with how fast the mood of the electorate was changing. We can see that by breaking down the error of 2020 primary polls by election date:\n\nPolls of the contests on Super Tuesday had a weighted average error of 12.8 points, with 60 percent of them conducted mostly before Biden\u2019s big South Carolina win and subsequent endorsements by onetime 2020 presidential contenders former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar.\n\nSouth Carolina polls had a weighted average error of 17.2 points (!), and 75 percent of them were conducted mostly before Rep. Jim Clyburn\u2019s endorsement of Biden.\n\nPolls of all other contests \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and every post-Super Tuesday state \u2014 had a weighted average error of 7.1 points, which is quite good by historical standards for primary polls.\n\nOne week torpedoed the 2020 primary polls Weighted average error of polls in the final 21 days* before each contest, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Contest Error Iowa 5.3 New Hampshire 4.9 Nevada 8.8 South Carolina 17.2 Super Tuesday 12.8 March 10 9.7 March 17 6.6 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular election date. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *Excluding New Hampshire primary polls taken before the Iowa caucuses, other states\u2019 primary polls taken before the New Hampshire primary, and primary polls whose leader or runner-up dropped out before that primary was held.\n\nIn addition, some pollsters fared better in the 2020 primaries than others. We\u2019d encourage you not to read too much into a pollster\u2019s performance in the 2020 primaries, as it typically takes a larger sample size to ascertain a pollster\u2019s true accuracy. But if there was a \u201cwinner\u201d for the 2020 primaries, it was Monmouth University, whose average error of 7.5 points was the lowest among firms that released five or more primary polls. Probably not by coincidence, Monmouth also has the highest FiveThirtyEight pollster rating overall \u2014 a sterling A+.\n\nIn general, pollsters that use the time-honored methodology of interviewing respondents live over the phone are more reliable than those that use alternative platforms like the internet, and that was mostly true in the 2020 primaries too. Suffolk University, another live-caller pollster, also performed pretty well (an average error of 8.0), although Marist College had an off year (13.3). Among online pollsters, YouGov \u2014 whose online methodology is more proven than most \u2014 excelled with a 7.6-point error, almost matching Monmouth\u2019s accuracy. The pollster with the highest average error (at least among those with five or more polls to analyze) was Change Research, at 16.1 points.\n\nThe best and worst pollsters of the 2020 primaries Average error of polls in the final 21 days* before 2020 presidential primaries and caucuses, for pollsters that conducted at least five polls, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Pollster Methodology No. of Polls Average Error Monmouth University Live 7 7.5 YouGov Online 9 7.6 Suffolk University Live 6 8.0 Emerson College IVR/Online/Text 13 8.5 AtlasIntel Online 8 8.8 Data for Progress Online/Text 29 9.3 Point Blank Political Online/Text 6 10.7 Swayable Online 22 12.0 Marist College Live 6 13.3 University of Massachusetts Lowell Online 6 14.0 Change Research Online 7 16.1 *Excluding New Hampshire primary polls taken before the Iowa caucuses, other states\u2019 primary polls taken before the New Hampshire primary, and primary polls whose leader or runner-up dropped out before that primary was held.\n\nFinally, as is our custom when updating the pollster ratings, let\u2019s take a look at the accuracy of polls as a whole through three different lenses \u2014 error, \u201ccalling\u201d elections correctly and statistical bias \u2014 each with an accompanying heat map.\n\nThe first lens is polling error \u2014 a.k.a. the same metric we\u2019ve been using so far in this article. Here\u2019s the weighted average error of polls for each election cycle since 1998, broken down by office. We already mentioned how polls of the 2020 primaries were not all that accurate historically speaking. But the limited polls we have for governor and U.S. House races this cycle have been pretty accurate so far. They had weighted average errors of 4.9 and 6.0, respectively, which is perfectly normal for these types of elections, although the sample size is still quite small.\n\n2020 primary polls misfired, but the polls are still all right Weighted average error of polls in the final 21 days before elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database President Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 8.2 7.5 7.1 7.7 1999-2000 4.8 6.1 4.4 4.4 7.7 5.6 2001-02 5.2 4.8 5.5 5.2 2003-04 4.8 5.0 5.5 3.2 6.9 4.6 2005-06 5.0 4.2 6.2 5.2 2007-08 4.2 4.7 5.7 3.5 7.6 5.4 2009-10 4.8 4.8 6.7 5.7 2011-12 4.9 4.7 5.3 3.7 9.0 5.3 2013-14 4.6 5.4 6.7 5.4 2015-16 5.4 4.9 5.8 4.9 10.3 6.8 2017-18 5.1 4.3 5.0 4.9 2019-20* 4.9 TBD 6.0 TBD 10.2 TBD All years 5.3 5.2 6.1 4.0 9.3 6.0 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential general elections to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nQuantifying polling error is arguably the best way to think about the accuracy of polls, but there are other lenses too. But say all you care about is whether polls \u201ccalled\u201d the election correctly \u2014 i.e., how often the candidate who led a poll ended up winning the election. We\u2019ve got a heat map for that too (although this isn\u2019t our preferred method, as it\u2019s a bit simplistic). Overall, since 1998, polls have picked the winner 79 percent of the time. And by this measure, the accuracy of 2020 primary polls clocked in at exactly average.\n\nPolls pick the winner 79 percent of the time Weighted average share of polls that correctly identified the winner in the final 21 days before elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database President Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 86% 87% 49% 76% 1999-2000 81 84 54 67% 95% 76 2001-02 87 82 73 81 2003-04 76 82 64 79 94 79 2005-06 89 92 73 84 2007-08 95 95 84 94 79 88 2009-10 85 85 77 82 2011-12 91 87 70 82 62 77 2013-14 80 75 76 77 2015-16 68 78 58 71 86 77 2017-18 74 74 79 75 2019-20* 88 TBD 41 TBD 79 TBD All years 82 83 72 79 81 79 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential general elections to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nFrankly, though, this isn\u2019t a great way to think about polls. Say a poll had the Republican ahead by 1 point but the Democrat ended up winning the election by 1 point \u2014 that\u2019s a pretty accurate result even though the winner was incorrectly identified. On the other hand, if the Republican ended up winning by 20 points, the poll did correctly identify the winner \u2014 but the absolute error was quite large.\n\nAdditionally, polls of close elections unsurprisingly make the wrong call much more frequently than races where there is no doubt which candidate is going to win. In both the 2020 primaries and overall, polls showing a blowout (i.e., the leader led by 20 points or more) picked the correct winner almost all the time, but they were right only about half the time when they showed a lead smaller than 3 points.\n\nPolls often miss close races Share of polls that correctly identified the winner in the final 21 days before elections, by how close the poll showed the race % of Polls Picking Winner Margin 2020 Primaries All Races Since 1998 <3 pts 46% 57% 3-6 72 70 6-10 79 84 10-15 75 93 15-20 82 97 \u226520 98 99 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nThis is why, when a poll shows a close race, your takeaway shouldn\u2019t be, \u201cThis candidate leads by 1 point!\u201d but rather, \u201cThis race is a toss-up.\u201d Polls\u2019 true utility isn\u2019t in telling us who will win, but rather in roughly how close a race is \u2014 and, therefore, how confident we should be in the outcome.\n\nThe third and final lens we\u2019ll use is polls\u2019 statistical bias. Statistical bias is different from error in that it tells us in which direction the error ran \u2014 i.e., did the polls consistently under- or overrate a specific political party? Not much has changed in this final table since the last time we published it, because we exclude presidential primaries from calculations of statistical bias (since all primary candidates belong to the same party), but we think it\u2019s worth reemphasizing its findings as we enter the 2020 general election.\n\nPolling bias is small and unpredictable Weighted average statistical bias of polls in the final 21 days before general elections, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings database Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House President Combined 1998 R+5.6 R+4.5 R+0.8 R+3.8 1999-2000 R+0.4 R+2.7 D+1.2 R+2.4 R+1.9 2001-02 D+3.0 D+1.3 D+1.5 D+2.2 2003-04 D+1.7 D+1.1 D+2.7 D+1.1 D+1.5 2005-06 D+0.2 R+1.3 D+0.7 D+0.0 2007-08 R+0.1 D+0.4 D+1.1 D+1.0 D+0.8 2009-10 R+0.1 R+0.7 D+1.7 D+0.6 2011-12 R+1.6 R+3.1 R+2.9 R+2.5 R+2.8 2013-14 D+2.3 D+2.6 D+3.8 D+2.7 2015-16 D+3.3 D+2.7 D+4.1 D+3.3 D+3.0 2017-18 R+0.9 D+0.1 R+0.6 R+0.5 2019-20* D+2.9 TBD D+6.0 TBD TBD All years D+0.5 D+0.1 D+0.8 D+0.3 D+0.3 Bias is calculated only for elections where the top two finishers were a Republican and a Democrat. Therefore, it is not calculated for presidential primaries. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis. *The gubernatorial and U.S. House figures are preliminary and based on small sample sizes. Because there are no polls of Senate or presidential races to incorporate, no combined score is given.\n\nThose findings: Over the long term, there is no meaningful partisan statistical bias in polling. All the polls in our data set combine for a weighted average statistical bias of 0.3 points toward Democrats. Individual election cycles can have more significant biases \u2014 and, importantly, it usually runs in the same direction for every office \u2014 but there is no pattern from year to year. In other words, just because polls overestimated Democrats in 2016 does not mean they will do the same in 2020. It\u2019s good to be aware of the potential for polling error heading into the election, but that error could benefit either party. In fact, we\u2019ve observed that preelection attempts to guess which way the polling error will run seem to have an uncanny knack for being wrong \u2014 which could be a coincidence or could reflect very real overcompensation.\n\nSo despite a rocky primary season, we recommend that you trust the polls in 2020. Of course, \u201ctrust the polls\u201d doesn\u2019t mean trust all the polls; that\u2019s why we have our pollster ratings. In addition to our handy letter grades, that page contains each pollster\u2019s average error, statistical bias and the share of races it called correctly, plus details on whether it adheres to methodological best practices and a lot more. You can also download our entire pollster ratings data set, including all the polls that went into the tables in this article, to investigate further on your own. (Wondering how much more accurate live-caller polls are than online ones? Or which state\u2019s polls are the most error-prone? Wonder no more.)\n\nFor a detailed methodology of the pollster ratings, check out this 2014 article; we made a few tweaks in 2016 and 2019, such as giving a \u201cslashed\u201d letter grade (e.g., \u201cA/B\u201d) to pollsters with a smaller body of work. There are no methodological changes this year, except we do have a bit of housekeeping that probably only pollsters will be interested in: Starting with our next pollster ratings update (after the 2020 elections), we will no longer give active pollsters a ratings boost for once belonging to the National Council on Public Polls (a now-defunct polling consortium whose members were committed to methodological transparency). Active pollsters will need to participate in the American Association for Public Opinion Research\u2019s Transparency Initiative or contribute to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archive to get credit in the \u201cNCPP/AAPOR/Roper\u201d column, which also determines which pollsters we consider \u201cgold standard.\u201d As always, if anyone has any questions about any aspect of the pollster ratings, you can always reach us at polls@fivethirtyeight.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Does Trump Really Want A Fight With Obama?", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/weve-updated-our-pollster-ratings-ahead-of-the-2020-general-election/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "The State Of The Polls, 2019", "text": "The State Of The Polls, 2019 Polls just had one of their best election cycles, ever \u2014 but challenges abound in the industry\n\nMuch maligned for their performance in the 2016 general election \u2014 and somewhat unfairly so, since the overall accuracy of the polls was only slightly below average that year by historical standards \u2014 American election polls have been quite accurate since then. Their performance was very strong in the 2018 midterms, despite the challenge of having to poll dozens of diverse congressional districts around the country, many of which had not had a competitive election in years. Polls have also generally been accurate in the various special elections and off-year gubernatorial elections that have occurred since 2016, even though those are also often difficult races to poll.\n\n[Related: FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings]\n\nDoes that mean everything is looking up in the industry? Well, no. We\u2019ll introduce some complications in a moment. But I do want to re-emphasize that opening takeaway, since the media is just flatly wrong when it asserts that the polls can\u2019t be trusted. In fact, American election polls are about as accurate as they\u2019ve always been. That doesn\u2019t mean polls will always identify the right winner, especially in close elections. (As a simple rule of thumb, we\u2019ve found polls \u201ccall\u201d the right winner 80 percent of the time, meaning they fail to do so the other 20 percent of the time \u2014 although upsets are more likely to occur in some circumstances than others.) But the rate of upsets hasn\u2019t changed much over time.\n\nBefore we go any further, I want to direct you to the latest version of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings, which we\u2019ve updated for the first time since May 2018. They include all polls in the three weeks leading up to every U.S. House, U.S. Senate and gubernatorial general election since then, including special elections, plus a handful of polls from past years that were missing from previous versions of our database. You can find much more detail on the pollster ratings here, including all the polls used in the ratings calculation. Our presidential approval ratings, generic congressional ballot and impeachment trackers have also been updated to reflect these new ratings, although they make little difference to the topline numbers.\n\nNow then, for those complications: The main one is simply that response rates to traditional telephone polls continue to decline. In large part because of caller-ID and call-blocking technologies, it\u2019s simply harder than it used to be to get people to answer phone calls from people they don\u2019t know. In addition to potentially making polls less accurate, that also makes them more expensive, since a pollster has to spend more time making calls for every completed response that it gets. As a result, the overall number of polls has begun to slightly decline. There were 532 polls in our pollster ratings database, which covers polls in the 21 days before elections occur, associated with elections on Nov. 6, 2018, which is down from 558 polls for Election Day 2014 and 692 polls for Election Day 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The races we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re watching on Election Day 2019\n\nSo why not turn to online polls or other new technologies? Well, the problem is that in recent elections, polls that use live interviewers to call both landlines and cellphones continue to outperform other methods, such as online and automated (IVR) polls. Moreover, online and IVR polls are generally more prone toward herding \u2014 that is, making methodological choices, or picking and choosing which results they publish, in ways that make their polls match other, more traditional polls. So not only are online and automated polls somewhat less accurate than live-caller polls, but they\u2019d probably suffer a further decline in accuracy if they didn\u2019t have live polls to herd toward.\n\nStill, online polling is undoubtedly a large part of polling\u2019s future \u2014 and some online polling firms are more accurate than others. Among the most prolific online pollsters, for example, YouGov stands out for being more accurate than others such as Zogby, SurveyMonkey, and Harris Insights & Analytics. And many former IVR pollsters are now migrating to hybrid methods that combine automated phone polling with internet panels. In the 2018 elections, this produced better results in some cases (e.g., SurveyUSA) than in others (e.g., Rasmussen Reports).\n\nPolls have been quite accurate \u2014 and unbiased \u2014 in post-2016 elections\n\nEach time we update our pollster ratings, we publish a few charts that depict the overall health of the industry \u2014 so let\u2019s go ahead and run the numbers again. The first chart is the one we consider to be the most important: the average error of polls broken down by the type of election. A few quick methodological notes:\n\nBy average error, I mean the difference between the margin projected by the poll and the actual election result. For instance, if the poll shows the Democrat up by 1 percentage point and the Republican wins by 2 points, that would be a 3-point error.\n\nTo not give any one polling firm too much influence, the values in the chart are weighted based on the number of polls a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle\n\nPolls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect that they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nNote that I\u2019ve included the handful of elections that have occurred so far in 2019 with the 2017-18 election cycle, even though we\u2019ll classify them them later as part of the 2019-20 cycle instead.\n\nOK, here\u2019s the data:\n\nPost-2016 polls have been accurate by historical standards Weighted-average error of polls in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Presidential Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 8.2 7.4 6.8 7.6 1999-2000 4.9 6.1 4.4 4.4 7.6 5.5 2001-02 5.2 4.9 5.4 5.2 2003-04 6.0 5.6 5.4 3.2 7.1 4.8 2005-06 5.0 4.2 6.5 5.3 2007-08 4.1 4.7 5.7 3.6 7.4 5.4 2009-10 4.9 4.8 6.9 5.7 2011-12 4.9 4.7 5.1 3.6 8.9 5.2 2013-14 4.6 5.5 6.5 5.4 2015-16 5.4 5.0 5.5 4.8 10.1 6.7 2017-19 5.3 4.3 5.0 5.0 All years 5.4 5.3 6.1 4.0 8.7 5.8 Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nAs I said, the 2017-19 cycle was one of the most accurate on record for polling. The average error of 5.0 points in polls of U.S. House elections is the second-best in our database, trailing only 1999-2000. The 4.3-point error associated with U.S. Senate elections is also the second-best, slightly trailing 2005-06. And gubernatorial polls had an average error of 5.3 points, which is about average by historical standards.\n\nCombining all different types of elections together, we find that polls from 2017 onward have been associated with an average error of 5.0 points, which is considerably better than the 6.7-point average for 2015-16, and the best in any election cycle since 2003-04.\n\nBut note that there\u2019s just not much of an overall trajectory \u2014 upward or downward \u2014 in polling accuracy. Relatively strong cycles for the polls can be followed by relatively weak ones, and vice versa.\n\nOne more key reminder now that the Iowa caucuses are only three months away: Some types of elections are associated with considerably larger polling errors than others. In particular, presidential primaries feature polling that is often volatile at best, and downright inaccurate at worst. Overall, presidential primary polls in our database mispredict the final margin between the top two candidates by an average of 8.7 points. And the error was even worse, 10.1 points, in the 2016 primary cycle. Leads of 10 points, 15 points or sometimes more are not necessarily safe in the primaries.\n\nWe can also look at polling accuracy by simply counting up how often the candidate leading in the poll wins his or her race. This isn\u2019t our preferred method, as it\u2019s a bit simplistic \u2014 if a poll had the Republican ahead by 1 point and the Democrat won by 1 point, that\u2019s a much more accurate result than if the Republican had won by 20, even though it would have incorrectly identified the winner. But across all polls in our database, the winner was \u201ccalled\u201d 79 percent of the time.\n\nPolls \u201ccall\u201d the winner right 79 percent of the time Weighted-average share of polls that correctly identified the winner in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Presidential Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House General Primary Combined 1998 86% 86% 57% 78% 1999-2000 80 80 56 68% 95% 76 2001-2002 87 87 77 82 2003-2004 76 76 69 78 94 79 2005-2006 89 89 71 83 2007-2008 95 95 83 94 80 88 2009-2010 85 85 75 82 2011-2012 90 90 70 81 63 77 2013-2014 80 80 76 77 2015-2016 68 68 57 71 86 77 2017-2019 77 77 78 76 All years 82 82 72 79 83 79 Pollsters get half-credit if they show a tie for the lead and one of the leading candidates wins. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nIn recent elections, the winning percentage has been slightly below the long-term average \u2014 it was 76 percent in 2017-19. But this reflects the recent uptick in close elections, and that resource-constrained pollsters tend to poll these close elections more heavily.\n\nAs basic as this analysis is, it\u2019s essential to remember that polls are much more likely to misidentify the winner when they show a close race. Polls in our database that showed a lead of 3 percentage points or less identified the winner only 58 percent of the time \u2014 a bit better than random chance, but not much better. But polls showing a 3- or 6-point lead were right 72 percent of the time, and those with a 6- or 10-point lead were right 86 percent of the time. (Errors in races showing double-digit leads are quite rare in general elections, although they occur with some frequency in primaries. And errors in races where one candidate leads by 20 or more points are once-in-a-blue-moon types of events, regardless of the type of election.)\n\nPolls often misidentify the winner in a close race Share of polls that correctly identified the winner in final 21 days before the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Leading candidate\u2019s margin Share of polls correctly identifying winner 0-3 points 58% \u2013 \u2013 3-6 points 72 \u2013 \u2013 6-10 points 86 \u2013 \u2013 10-15 points 94 \u2013 \u2013 15-20 points 98 \u2013 \u2013 \u226520 points >99 \u2013 \u2013 Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nAnother essential measure of polling accuracy is statistical bias \u2014 that is, whether the polls tend to miss in the same direction. We\u2019re particularly interested in understanding whether polls systematically favor Democrats or Republicans. Take the polls in 2016, for instance. Although they weren\u2019t that bad from an accuracy standpoint, the majority underestimated President Trump and Republicans running for Congress and governor, leading them to underestimate how well Trump would do in the Electoral College. Overall in the 2015-16 cycle, polls had a Democratic bias (meaning they overestimated Democrats and underestimated Republicans) of 3.0 percentage points. And that after a 2013-14 cycle when polls also had a Democratic bias (of 2.7 percentage points).\n\nPolling bias is not very consistent from cycle to cycle Weighted-average statistical bias of polls in final 21 days of the election, among polls in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Cycle Governor U.S. Senate U.S. House Pres.

Therefore, it is not calculated for presidential primaries. Averages are weighted by the square root of the number of polls that a particular pollster conducted for that particular type of election in that particular cycle. Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nIn 2017-19, however, polls had essentially no partisan bias, and to the extent there was one, it was a very slight bias toward Republicans (0.3 percentage points). And that\u2019s been the long-term pattern: Whatever bias there is in one batch of election polls doesn\u2019t tend to persist from one cycle to the next. The Republican bias in the polls in 2011-12, for instance, which tended to underestimate then-President Obama\u2019s re-election margins, was followed by two cycles of Democratic bias in 2013-14 and 2015-16, as previously mentioned. There is simply not much point in trying to guess the direction of poll bias ahead of time; if anything, it often seems to go against what the conventional wisdom expects. Instead, you should always be prepared for the possibility of systematic polling errors of several percentage points in either direction.\n\nWhich pollsters have been most accurate in recent elections?\n\nAlthough it can be dangerous to put too much stock in the performance of a pollster in a single election cycle \u2014 it takes dozens of polls to reliably assess a pollster\u2019s accuracy \u2014 it\u2019s nonetheless worth briefly remarking on the recent performance of some of the more prolific ones. Below, you\u2019ll find the average error, statistical bias and a calculation we call Advanced Plus-Minus (basically, how the pollster\u2019s average error compares to other pollsters\u2019 in the same election), for pollsters with at least five polls in our database for the 2017-19 cycle. Note that negative Advanced Plus-Minus scores are good; they indicate that a firm\u2019s polls were more accurate than others in the same races.\n\nHow prolific pollsters have fared in recent elections Advanced Plus-Minus scores and other metrics for pollsters who conducted at least five surveys for the 2017-19 cycle, in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Pollster Methodology No. of Polls Avg.

In exciting news for fans of innovative polling, the list includes polls from our friends at The New York Times\u2019s Upshot, who launched an extremely successful and accurate polling collaboration with Siena College in 2016. (It also includes ABC News, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s corporate parent, which usually conducts its polls jointly with The Washington Post.)\n\nConversely, the five of the top six worst-performing pollsters \u2014 including firms such as Carroll Strategies, Dixie Strategies, and Rasmussen Reports/Pulse Opinion Research \u2014 were IVR pollsters (sometimes in conjunction with other methods), several of which had strong Republican leans in 2017-19. Some IVR pollsters did perform reasonably well in 2015-16, a cycle where most pollsters underestimated Republicans. In retrospect, though, that may have been a case of two wrongs making a right; IVR polls tend to be Republican-leaning, so they\u2019ll look good in years where Republicans beat their polls, but they\u2019ll often be among the worst polls otherwise.\n\nIndeed, aggregating the pollsters by methodology confirms that live caller polls continue to be the most accurate. Below are the aggregate scores for the three major categories of polls \u2014 live caller, online, and IVR \u2014 by our Advanced Plus-Minus metric, average error and statistical bias.\n\nLive-caller polls have been most accurate in recent elections Advanced Plus-Minus scores and other metrics for pollsters who conducted at least five surveys for the 2017-19 cycle, in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Pollster Ratings database Methodology No. of Polls Avg.

Polls that are banned by FiveThirtyEight because we know or suspect they faked data are excluded from the analysis.\n\nThe differences are clearest when looking at pollsters that exclusively used one method. Polls that exclusively used live callers (including calling cellphones) had an average error of 4.4 percentage points in the 2017-19 cycle, as compared to 5.0 points for polls exclusively conducted online or via text message, and 6.9 points for polls that exclusively used IVR. (Pure IVR polls, however, are now quite rare. Polls that used a hybrid of IVR and other methods did better, with an average error of 5.0 percentage points.)\n\nPolling firms that are members of professional polling organizations that push for transparency and other best practices also continue to outperform those that aren\u2019t. In particular, our pollster ratings give credit to firms that support the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) Transparency Initiative, belong to the National Council on Public Polls (NCPP), or contribute data to the Roper Center archive. Pollsters that are part of one or more of these initiatives had an average error of 4.3 percentage points in the 2017-19 cycle, as compared to 5.4 percentage points for those that aren\u2019t.\n\nAnother way to detect herding\n\nOur pollster ratings have also long included an adjustment to account for the fact that online and automated polls tend to perform better when there are high-quality polls in the field. We\u2019ve confirmed that this still applies. For instance, polls that are conducted online or via IVR are about 0.4 percentage points more accurate based on our Advanced Plus-Minus metric when their polls are preceded by \u201cgold standard\u201d polls in the same race. (\u201cGold standard\u201d is the term we use for pollsters that are exclusively live caller with cellphones and are also AAPOR/NCPP/Roper members.) Live-caller polls do not exhibit the same pattern, however; their Advanced Plus-Minus score is unaffected by the existence of an earlier \u201cgold standard\u201d poll in the field. This is probably the result of herding; some of the lower-quality pollsters may be doing the equivalent of peeking at their more studious classmate\u2019s answers in a math test. In fact, these differences are especially strong in recent elections, suggesting that herding has become more of a problem.\n\nThere is also a second, more direct method to detect herding, which we\u2019re also now applying in our pollster ratings. Namely \u2014 as described in this story \u2014 there is a minimum distance that a poll should be from the average of previous polls based on sampling error alone. For instance, even if you knew that a candidate was ahead 48-41 in a particular race \u2014 a 7-point lead \u2014 you\u2019d miss that margin by an average of about 5 percentage points in a 600-person poll because sampling only 600 people rather than the entire population introduces sampling error. That is, because of sampling error, some polls would inevitably show a 12-point lead and some would show a 2-point lead instead of all the polls being bunched together at a 6- or 7- or 8-point lead exactly. If the polls are very tightly bunched together, this is not a good thing \u2014 you should be suspicious of herding, which can sometimes yield embarrassing outcomes where every poll gets the answer wrong\n\nOf course, there are other complications in the real world. There\u2019s no guarantee that the race will have been static since other pollsters surveyed the race; one candidate may be losing or gaining ground. And pollsters have healthy methodological disagreements from one another, so the same race may look different depending on what assumptions they make about turnout and so forth. But these should tend to increase the degree to which polls differ from each other, and not produce herding.\n\nBut our herding penalty only applies if pollsters show too little variation from the average of previous polls of the race based on sampling error alone. If a pollster is publishing all its data without being influenced by other pollsters \u2014 including its supposed outliers \u2014 it should be fairly easy to avoid this penalty over the long run.\n\nMany polls are closer to the average of previous polls than they \u201cshould\u201d be, however. Unlike the previous type of herding I described, which is concentrated among lower-quality pollsters who are essentially trying to draft off their neighbors to get better results, this tendency appears among some higher-quality pollsters as well. In some cases, we suspect, this is because, late in the race, a pollster doesn\u2019t want to deal with the media firestorm that would inevitably ensue if it published a poll that appears to be an outlier. In other cases, frankly, we suspect that pollsters rather explicitly look at the FiveThirtyEight or RealClearPolitics polling average and attempt to match it.\n\nIn any event, our formula now detects this type of herding, and it results in a lower pollster rating when we catch it. . Our pollster ratings spreadsheet now calculates each pollster\u2019s Average Distance from Polling Average, or ADPA, which is how much the pollster\u2019s average poll differs from the average of previous polls of that race. Among pollsters with at least 15 polls, the largest herding penalties are as follows:\n\nWhich pollsters show the clearest signs of herding? Pollster Herding Penalty Research Co. 1.17 Muhlenberg College 0.84 Angus Reid Global 0.82 Grove Insight 0.71 NBC News/Wall Street Journal 0.53 The list is limited to pollsters with at least 15 polls for which an average of previous polls can be computed.\n\nOther methodological changes\n\nUnless you\u2019re really into details \u2014 or you\u2019re a pollster! \u2014 you probably aren\u2019t going to care about these \u2026 but there are a few other methodological changes we\u2019ve made to our pollster ratings this year.\n\nPreviously, pollsters got a bonus if they exclusively conducted their polls via live callers with cellphones, since these have been the most accurate polls over time. But this year, if a pollster uses live-caller-with-cellphone polls in combination with other methodologies, we now give them partial credit for the live-caller bonus. Even though these hybrid polls did not have a particularly good performance in 2017-19, they\u2019ve been reasonably strong in the long run; also, we\u2019re bowing to the reality that many formerly live pollsters are increasingly incorporating online or other methods into their repertoire.\n\nIn determining whether a poll\u2019s result fell into or outside the margin of error, a calculation that\u2019s available in our spreadsheet, we now use a more sophisticated margin of error formula that accounts for the percentages of the top two candidates and not just the distance between them. The margin of error is smaller in lopsided races, e.g., when one candidate leads 70-20.\n\nOur Predictive Plus-Minus scores and pollster letter grades are based on a combination of a pollster\u2019s empirical performance (how accurate it has been in the past) and its methodological characteristics. The more polls a firm has conducted, the more the formula weights its performance rather than its methodological prior. In assigning the weights, our formula now considers how recent a particular firm\u2019s polls were. In other words, if a pollster has conducted a lot of surveys recently, its empirical accuracy will be more heavily weighted. But if most of its polling is in the distant past, its pollster rating will gradually revert toward the mean based on its methodology.\n\nFor pollsters with a relatively small sample of polling, we now show a provisional rating rather than a precise letter grade. (An \u201cA/B\u201d provisional rating means that the pollster has shown strong initial results, a \u201cB/C\u201d rating means it has average initial results, and a \u201cC/D\u201d rating means below-average initial results.) It now takes roughly 20 recent polls (or a larger number of older polls) for a pollster to get a precise pollster rating.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now! Once again, you can find an interactive version of the pollster ratings here, and a link with further detail on them here. And if you have questions about the pollster ratings, you can always reach us here. Good luck to pollsters on having a strong performance in the primaries.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-state-of-the-polls-2019/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "The State Of The Polls, 2016", "text": "Two years ago, in advance of the 2014 midterms and in conjunction with the release of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s pollster ratings, I wrote an article headlined \u201cIs The Polling Industry In Stasis Or In Crisis?\u201d It pointed out a seeming contradiction: Although there were lots of reasons to be worried about the reliability of polling \u2014 in particular, the ever-declining response rates for telephone surveys \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much evidence of a crisis in the results pollsters were obtaining. Instead, the 2008, 2010 and 2012 election cycles had all featured fairly accurate polling.\n\nHas the reckoning come for the polls since then? The evidence is somewhat mixed. The 2014 midterm elections were not a banner year for pollsters, with most polls showing a statistical bias toward Democrats (reversing their statistical bias toward Republicans in 2012). As a result, there were a handful of major upsets by Republican candidates, along with a few near misses. Still, the error in the polls was reasonably in line with historical norms. It wasn\u2019t the disaster that pollsters have experienced in other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Greece, or even in previous U.S. midterm elections, such as 1994 and 1998.\n\nPollster Ratings: We\u2019ve analyzed the historical accuracy of more than 350 polling agencies and rated them according to performance and methodology. See all of our pollster ratings \u00bb\n\nIf the 2014 midterm polls were a little better than reputed, however, the reverse might be true of the 2016 presidential primaries polls. Importantly, the polls (and even more so, the polling averages) had a good track record of calling winners, with the polling front-runner winning the vast majority of the time. Furthermore, the polls caught wind of Donald Trump\u2019s popularity among Republicans early in the cycle, even as a lot of journalists (including, uhh, yours truly) were deeply skeptical about his chances. But the margins were often pretty far off, especially in the Democratic race, with Hillary Clinton often blowing away her polling numbers in the South and Bernie Sanders often doing so elsewhere in the country. Furthermore, although there weren\u2019t many upsets, at least one of them \u2014 Sanders\u2019s win in Michigan \u2014 was historically epic.\n\nDon\u2019t take our word for it, though: We\u2019d encourage you to explore the data for yourself. We\u2019ve just released a new set of pollster ratings, based on data up through and including the Oregon presidential primary May 17. We\u2019ve also published the raw data behind these ratings: more than 7,900 polls conducted in the final three weeks before presidential primaries and caucuses and general elections for president, governor, and the U.S. Senate and House since 1998.\n\nThe methodology we use to calculate the pollster ratings is highly similar to the procedures we followed to generate our 2014 ratings, with a handful of exceptions that I describe in the footnotes.\n\nAs before, the ratings are based both on a pollster\u2019s past accuracy and on two easily measurable methodological standards:\n\nThe first standard is whether the firm participates in the American Association for Public Opinion Research Transparency Initiative, is a member of the National Council on Public Polls or contributes its data to the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archive. Polling firms that do one or more of these things generally abide by industry-standard practices for disclosure, transparency and methodology and have historically had more accurate results.\n\nThe second standard is whether the firm usually conducts its polls by placing telephone calls with live interviewers and calls cellphones as well as landlines. Automated polls (\u201crobopolls\u201d), which are legally prohibited from calling cellphones, do not meet this standard even if they use hybrid or mixed-mode methodologies (for example, robocalling landlines and then supplementing with cellphone calls placed by live interviewers). It\u2019s increasingly essential to call cellphones given that about half of American households no longer have a home landline. Although internet polls show promise as a potential alternative, they do not yet have a long enough or consistent enough track record to be placed on the same pedestal as high-quality, live-interview telephone polls, based on our view of the evidence.\n\nBut enough about methodology; let\u2019s return to the question of how the polls fared in the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential primaries.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a calculation we call Simple Average Error. It measures the difference between the percentage of the vote separating the top two finishers in the election and the margin shown by the polls. For instance, if a poll had projected Trump to beat Ted Cruz by 2 percentage points in an election and Trump won by 10 points, that would count as an 8 percentage point error. Likewise, it would count as an 8-point error if Trump had been projected to beat Cruz by 2 points but lost to him by 6 instead.\n\nIn 2014, the average gubernatorial poll had an error of 4.5 percentage points as defined in this way, and the average Senate poll had an error of 5.4 percentage points. The gubernatorial polls were a bit more accurate than usual and the Senate polls a bit less, but both figures are reasonably in line with historical norms. A bigger problem is that most of these polls missed in the same direction, underestimating the Republican candidate. (We\u2019ll take that point up in a moment.)\n\nHouse polls are typically less accurate than Senate or gubernatorial polls \u2014 the further down the ballot you go, the larger the polling error tends to be \u2014 and 2014 was no exception, with the average House poll missing by 7.9 percentage points. That\u2019s not a good result by any stretch of the imagination, although that number is inflated somewhat by a single polling firm, YouGov, which ambitiously released polls of all 435 congressional districts. Most of those polls had small sample sizes of fewer than 200 respondents, and most of them were in noncompetitive districts, which can be difficult to poll. (Our Advanced Plus-Minus and Predictive Plus-Minus calculations adjust for these factors, but Simple Average Error does not.) Excluding YouGov, the average error for House polls was 6.6 percentage points, still a mediocre performance, although similar to past years such as 1998 and 2010.\n\nIf House races can be tricky to poll, presidential primaries are even harder, for some of the reasons I mention here. Turnout is relatively low, people are sometimes choosing among several similar candidates, and voters often wait until the last minute to make their decisions. So primary polling is almost always a fairly wild ride. Still, the average error in primary polls this year was a whopping 9.4 percentage points, worse than the average of 8.1 percentage points in all presidential primaries since 2000. The problems were worse on the Democratic side, with an average error of 10.6 percentage points, compared with 8.3 percentage points in the Republican race.\n\nAnd yet, the primary polls have done a pretty good job of picking winners. In 85 percent of polls this year, the leading candidate in the poll matched the winning candidate in the election. That\u2019s much better than in 2012, when the leading candidate won in the polls only 61 percent of the time.\n\nWhat gives? A lot of primaries and caucuses were lopsided this year, with strongly regional voting patterns; Clinton dominated in the South, and Trump cleaned up in the Northeast, for example. (By contrast, a lot of Republican primaries came down to the wire in 2012.) It\u2019s easier to call the winners right, of course, when an election isn\u2019t competitive. On the other hand, it can be harder for pollsters to nail down the margin in such races. A seemingly noncompetitive race can discourage turnout, either allowing the leading candidate to run up the score or, occasionally, the trailing candidate to do much better than expected because the leading candidate\u2019s voters become complacent. As a technical matter, the handling of undecided voters also matters more in noncompetitive races. In a slight change this year, our Advanced Plus-Minus and Predictive Plus-Minus ratings account for the fact that less-competitive races are associated with a larger error, on average. Still, this doesn\u2019t entirely excuse the polls.\n\nAnother useful measure of polling performance is statistical bias, which indicates whether polls consistently miss in the same direction. If over a large number of races, for example, your polling firm projects Democratic candidates to win by an average of 5 percentage points, and they win by 2 percentage points instead, that means those polls had a pro-Democratic (and anti-Republican) statistical bias of 3 percentage points. Statistical bias isn\u2019t necessarily an indication of partisan bias; some media outlets that are accused of having a pro-Republican bias in their coverage have a pro-Democratic statistical bias in their polls, and vice versa. But it has nevertheless been a problem in recent years:\n\nIn 2012, the polls had a 2 or 3 percentage point pro-Republican bias, meaning that they underrated how well President Obama would do, along with Democratic candidates in gubernatorial and congressional races. In 2014, by contrast, they had roughly a 3 percentage point pro-Democratic bias. So rather than the merely good Republican year implied by the polls, Republicans had a near-landslide in the midterms instead.\n\nThe good news is that, over the long run, the polls haven\u2019t had much of an overall bias, having underrated Republicans in some elections and Democrats in others. But the bias has shifted around somewhat unpredictably from election to election. You should be wary of claims that the polls are bound to be biased in the same direction that they were two years ago or four years ago.\n\nYou should also recognize the potential for statistical bias even (or perhaps especially) if the polls all seem to agree with one another. An uncannily strong consensus among the polls may indicate herding, which means polling firms are suppressing outlier results that appear out of line with the consensus. Good election forecasting models can account for the possibility of herding and statistical bias by assuming that the error in polls is correlated from state to state, but it raises the degree of difficulty in building a model.\n\nWhat about bias in the presidential primary polls? Those numbers aren\u2019t shown in the table above because the bias calculations we list in our pollster ratings pertain only to general elections. But we can calculate them by the same method. Indeed, statistical bias has been a problem in both party primaries this year.\n\nIn Republican primaries and caucuses, the polls generally had a pro-Trump and anti-Cruz bias. In races where Trump and Cruz were the top two finishers in some order, the bias was 5.5 percentage points in Trump\u2019s favor. The bias dissipated as the race went along, and there wasn\u2019t as much of a bias when another candidate \u2014 John Kasich or Marco Rubio \u2014 was Trump\u2019s main competitor in a state. Still, the primary results ought to raise doubts about the theory that a \u201csilent majority\u201d of Trump supporters is being overlooked by the polls. In the primaries, Trump was somewhat overrated by the polls.\n\nIn the Democratic race, the polls had a 1.8 percentage point bias toward Clinton (and against Sanders) overall. However, it varied significantly based on the demographic makeup of the state, with Clinton outperforming her polls in diverse states and Sanders beating his in whiter ones. Specifically, in states where at least 25 percent of the population is black or Hispanic, the polls had a pro-Sanders, anti-Clinton bias of 5.7 percentage points. But they had an 8.2 percentage point bias toward Clinton, and against Sanders, in states where less than 25 percent of the population is black or Hispanic.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the polls mostly identified the right winners, and some of the bias reflected the candidates\u2019 running up the score in demographically favorable terrain. (Clinton, for instance, won South Carolina by 47 percentage points instead of the 27 points projected by the polls.) Still, the results are troubling given that the Sanders and Clinton coalitions each contain hard-to-poll groups. In Clinton\u2019s case, that means black and Hispanic voters, who are usually harder for polls to reach than white voters. For Sanders, that means young and first-time voters, who are also hard to reach and who are sometimes screened out incorrectly by likely voter models. Pollsters should think carefully about their strategies for reaching these groups in the general election.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s take a look at how some of the more prolific pollsters have performed recently. The following table contains our Advanced Plus-Minus scores for polling firms that released at least 20 total polls between the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential primaries. Advanced Plus-Minus measures a poll\u2019s error as compared against others that surveyed the same race, controlling for factors such as the number of days between the poll and the election. Negative scores are good and mean the pollster performed better than other polling firms under similar conditions.\n\nThe best-performing polls recently have been those from Monmouth University and those from Marist College. Both apply \u201cgold standard\u201d methodologies, using live telephone interviews and placing calls to cellphones as well as landlines, and both participate in the AAPOR Transparency Initiative. Quinnipiac University, another \u201cgold standard\u201d pollster, has also performed fairly well of late. So has Fox News, which switched to new polling partners in 2011 and has gotten good results since then.\n\nAutomated polling firms have gotten mediocre results in recent years, especially SurveyUSA and Rasmussen Reports, although note that SurveyUSA has a long history of accurate polling and so retains a high grade overall. Public Policy Polling has gotten fairly good results, by contrast, although that may be because the pollster engages in a high degree of herding.\n\nYouGov, which fared poorly by calculations such as Simple Average Error, gets about an average rating according to Advanced Plus-Minus, which accounts for the fact that they were polling under difficult circumstances (for instance, polling obscure House races that nobody else tried to survey). Still, we\u2019re awaiting more evidence about the reliability of online polls. SurveyMonkey, which has sometimes partnered with FiveThirtyEight, released a set of polls of the Democratic and Republican primaries before Super Tuesday and got mediocre results, but it isn\u2019t really enough data to come to conclusions about long-term accuracy. Other online polling firms, such as Morning Consult and Ipsos, have focused on national polls instead of issuing state polls ahead of key primaries and general elections. In my view, the online pollsters have been too gun-shy as a group (with YouGov an important exception) to issue polls of state and local elections. These firms employ a lot of smart people, and my working assumption is that online polls are already more accurate than automated telephone polls (if not necessarily traditional telephone polls, at least not yet). But that\u2019s nothing more than an educated guess until we get more data on how they perform.\n\nListen to the latest episode of the FiveThirtyEight politics podcast.\n\nParticipation in the AAPOR Transparency Initiative, NCPP or the Roper Center archive continues to be a strong predictor of polling accuracy. Polling firms that get our AAPOR/NCPP/Roper check mark have had an Advanced Plus-Minus score of -0.4 since 2014, compared with a score of +0.8 for those that don\u2019t have it.\n\nAll told, the evidence is ambiguous enough to be consistent with almost any case you\u2019d like to make: either that the polls are about as accurate as they\u2019ve always been, which isn\u2019t to say that they\u2019re perfect, or that there are real warning signs of trouble ahead, which isn\u2019t to say the polls are useless. The answer may also depend on which polls you\u2019re looking at. As we\u2019ve found in the past, polls that employ more expensive methodologies, and abide by higher levels of disclosure and transparency, tend to be more accurate than those that don\u2019t. It may be that the best polls are roughly as accurate as ever but that the worst polls are increasingly far off the mark.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-state-of-the-polls-2016/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "How One High-Risk Community In Rural South Carolina Is Bracing For COVID-19", "text": "How One High-Risk Community In Rural South Carolina Is Bracing For COVID-19 Hardeeville has one of the country\u2019s highest ratios of vulnerable residents to ICU beds.\n\nJust as some demographic groups are more at risk than others of getting seriously ill from the new coronavirus, some parts of the country are more vulnerable to being hit hard by this pandemic. In places with more sick people, more people over 65 and fewer hospital beds per person, the health care system could easily be swamped, leaving residents who need hospitalization in even greater danger.\n\nTo find the areas at the greatest risk of being overwhelmed by a COVID-19 outbreak, we analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a collection of surveys that ask U.S. residents about their health, which allowed us to estimate what percentage of residents in a region were at risk due to their age or underlying health conditions. We then used Kaiser Health News\u2019s data on the number of hospitals and intensive care unit beds in each U.S. county to find the ratio of at-risk residents to beds.\n\nBy that measure, one of the most vulnerable regions for which we have data is the Hilton Head Island metropolitan area, where about 63 percent of adults are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and there are approximately 3,900 high-risk individuals for every ICU bed.\n\nWhile the percentage of Hilton Head residents who are at risk is on the higher end of our data set, it\u2019s still notably lower than the 70 to 80 percent we saw in several other areas we analyzed. But those regions had more health care facilities to serve those at-risk residents, while the Hilton Head area has only three hospitals and 28 ICU beds.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight\n\nTake Hardeeville, for example. It\u2019s a small city in the Hilton Head metropolitan area, and in many ways it\u2019s like any other rural area. Under normal circumstances, the city\u2019s residents would be looking forward to an Easter egg hunt, golf and pickleball tournaments, proms and graduations. But the people of Hardeeville are particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus. In the last decade, the city has seen a population boom, and many of those new residents are retirees, according to Hardeeville Mayor Harry Williams. The city\u2019s large older population \u2014 the percentage of residents who\u2019ve hit retirement age is nearly twice as high as the national share of people over 65 \u2014 may be cause for concern, as Jasper County, where Hardeeville is located, has only one hospital and four ICU beds.\n\nWhile regular hospital beds can be converted to serve critically ill patients, it\u2019s not easy to do because ICU beds require more equipment and specialized room layouts. Despite the difficulties, Coastal Carolina Hospital, the only hospital in Jasper County, has added beds for seriously ill patients by turning its observation unit into an ICU patient treatment area, according to hospital CEO Joel Taylor. Other hospitals are adding beds in temporary spaces like tents and trailers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just a lack of beds that can strain the health care system, noted David Wallace, a critical care doctor and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Shortages of space, staff, medications and other vital resources are also a concern, and health systems in rural and poorer areas will be stretched the thinnest.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be parts of the country that don\u2019t even have the staffing even if you were able to ramp up your available resources, in terms of places to put these patients,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIf we were able to create more ICU beds and more ventilators and more [personal protective equipment], who\u2019s going to be staffing those areas?\u201d\n\nCoastal Carolina Hospital is cataloguing what skills workers already have and cross-training them to work in parts of the hospital outside their normal assignments. This gives the hospital more flexibility in staffing, allowing it to do more with a limited number of employees by switching people to cover areas facing staffing shortfalls.\n\nHardeeville\u2019s mayor is also worried about how easy it would be for the area to run out of other types of vital workers, like first responders. \u201cBeing in a rural area, we have a good staff, but it\u2019s not a staff that can afford to have a whole shift wiped out because one person got sick and passed it onto the entire shift,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big concern of ours because we don\u2019t have replacement numbers if our first responders get sick.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the city got a shipment of additional masks and other protective gear for its first responders a few weeks ago, just as supplies were running low. So far, the city hasn\u2019t run out, but it also doesn\u2019t have a stockpile that would last through a big surge of cases.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there have only been 15 COVID-19 cases and one death in Jasper County, according to South Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Environmental Control. COVID-19 data should always be taken with a grain of salt, though, since tests have been so hard to come by. The closest testing site to Hardeeville is a hospital in a neighboring county, about 35 minutes away. Coastal Carolina is working on being able to test patients on site, Taylor said.\n\nThe state is encouraging residents to practice social distancing. But of course, staying at home is easier for some people than others. Williams said that in the gated communities where older residents often live, \u201cAmazon is a way of life,\u201d but that\u2019s not the case for working families.\n\n\u201cDelivery services are not as effective as, let\u2019s say, New York City,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor the working families that have to go to the grocery stores, go to Walmart for their everyday needs, those people need to go out. Those stores are open and they are taking precautions. The governor has limited the amount of people allowed in them, based on their square footage.\u201d\n\nBut even those who have to go out are doing their best to keep infection rates down, Williams said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s pitching in.\u201d\n\nBut more people may start leaving their homes soon. Shutting down businesses is having devastating effects on the economy, and the Hilton Head area is a popular vacation destination, so losing that influx of tourism dollars is an especially big blow for places like Hardeeville. South Carolina\u2019s governor announced Monday to allow public beaches and some retail stores to reopen. But experts say relaxing social distancing measures too soon and before testing is widely available might result in another influx of cases, overwhelming the health care system and leading to even more deaths.\n\nFind the full data set on GitHub to see if your area is included and how it compares with other areas.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-one-high-risk-community-in-rural-south-carolina-is-bracing-for-covid-19/", "author": ["Likhitha Butchireddygari"]}, {"title": "How Urban Or Rural Is Your State? And What Does That Mean For The 2020 Election?", "text": "How Urban Or Rural Is Your State? And What Does That Mean For The 2020 Election?\n\nThe 2016 election may not have been a realignment by historical standards, but it did bring the country\u2019s political divides more in line with its cultural divides \u2014 the biggest of which may be the growing chasm between urban and rural Americans.\n\nEssentially, it boils down to this: Cities and (especially these days) suburbs vote Democratic, and rural areas vote Republican. Some research suggests that these patterns hold up even after accounting for other important political predictors like race or gender. And there\u2019s evidence that the urban-rural divide has continued to increase since 2016. For example, San Diego has historically voted Republican, but the GOP was shut out of the 2020 mayoral election after two Democrats won the most votes in the city\u2019s March jungle primary. At the same time, Republicans widened their margins in rural areas even amid their defeat in the 2018 midterms, and parts of Appalachia that had voted Democratic for generations now vote Republican up and down the ballot, completing their conversion to the GOP under President Trump.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, however, to measure just how urban or rural a place is (although CityLab\u2019s Congressional Density Index and The New York Times Upshot\u2019s \u201cneighborhood density\u201d are good starts). So FiveThirtyEight came up with one of its own, which has already played a role in our 2020 primary forecast\u2019s \u201cfundamentals\u201d calculations. Essentially, we calculated the average number of people living within a five-mile radius of every census tract and took the natural logarithm to create an \u201curbanization index,\u201d or a calculation of how urban or rural a given area is. And this number can be calculated (via a weighted average based on each census tract\u2019s population) for states, congressional districts, counties \u2014 or anything that is made up of census tracts. Here is a calculation for how urban or rural each of the 50 states is:\n\nHow urban or rural is your state?

The states with the highest urbanization indices include a lot of blue states, like New York, New Jersey and California. Meanwhile, the rural end of the spectrum is populated with red states like Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota. Indeed, if we directly compare this metric with the results of the 2016 presidential election, we can quantify just how important the urban-rural divide has become in our politics.\n\nAs you can see in the chart below, 10 of the 13 most urban states voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, while 12 of the 14 most rural states voted for Trump. The exceptions: the fairly urbanized states of Florida, Arizona and Texas, which went for Trump, and the more rural states of Vermont and Maine, which cast their ballots for Clinton.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, too, that this relationship between a state\u2019s \u201curbanness\u201d and its presidential vote will get even stronger in 2020, as the correlation got noticeably tighter from 2012 to 2016 (the correlation coefficient was 0.55 in 2012 and 0.69 in 2016).\n\nSo let\u2019s indulge in a little hypothetical and take this possibility to the extreme. What if the 2020 presidential vote were based purely on our urbanization index? According to our calculations, Democrats would win such a presidential election handily \u2014 323 electoral votes to 215. And the election would produce a pretty funky-looking Electoral College map \u2014 one that looks simultaneously impossible and yet also like the logical conclusion of the way our politics has been trending. Here\u2019s what the margin of victory would look like in each state:\n\nWhat if the urban-rural divide dictated the 2020 election? The results of a hypothetical presidential election if a state\u2019s urbanization were the only factor, based on the relationship between FiveThirtyEight\u2019s urbanization index and 2016 presidential election results State Result State Result Alabama R+16.0 Montana R+30.8 Alaska R+27.3 Nebraska R+8.2 Arizona D+6.1 Nevada D+12.3 Arkansas R+20.5 New Hampshire R+11.9 California D+17.7 New Jersey D+18.3 Colorado D+4.2 New Mexico R+12.2 Connecticut D+7.6 New York D+22.5 Delaware D+2.3 North Carolina R+6.6 Florida D+8.3 North Dakota R+23.2 Georgia R+3.6 Ohio D+0.6 Hawaii D+3.3 Oklahoma R+11.6 Idaho R+16.1 Oregon R+1.5 Illinois D+10.3 Pennsylvania D+4.1 Indiana R+5.5 Rhode Island D+11.6 Iowa R+16.1 South Carolina R+9.4 Kansas R+9.3 South Dakota R+27.4 Kentucky R+13.6 Tennessee R+8.3 Louisiana R+8.6 Texas D+4.5 Maine R+23.4 Utah D+1.7 Maryland D+11.5 Vermont R+25.9 Massachusetts D+13.2 Virginia D+1.0 Michigan R+0.3 Washington D+3.8 Minnesota R+4.9 West Virginia R+22.4 Mississippi R+25.1 Wisconsin R+8.3 Missouri R+8.2 Wyoming R+33.6 Source: American Community Survey\n\nYes, some of the results are fantasies. Utah, despite being a bit more urban than your average state, is not going to vote Democratic any time soon. And if Vermont votes Republican by nearly 26 points, please pinch me.\n\nBut other results look more plausible, even if they are maybe a few election cycles away from this reality. In this scenario, the Midwest continues its embrace of the GOP, enough to make Minnesota a red state and Wisconsin go Republican by more than 8 points. Thanks to Chicago, Illinois would be the only Democratic bastion left in the region; Michigan and Ohio, though, would remain swing states.\n\nDemocrats, however, would more than make up for losses in the Midwest with wins in the Sun Belt. Florida, Arizona and Texas would become light blue states in this hypothetical. And given that these three states were decided by single digits in 2016, it\u2019s actually not that far-fetched that they could vote Democratic in 2020 in real life. That said, two other emerging Democratic targets, Georgia and North Carolina, remain red states in a world where elections break down exactly along urban-rural lines.\n\nBear in mind that this exercise was, as they say, for entertainment purposes only. The urban-rural divide will never explain everything about our politics; indeed, analysis that places too much weight on it misses the fact that many African Americans in rural areas vote Democratic, or that many Cuban Americans in urban areas like Miami vote Republican. But it does help to illustrate why so many Democrats believe the path forward for their party is through the Sun Belt.\n\nAnd indeed, early polls suggest former Vice President Joe Biden is competitive with Trump in Florida, Arizona and, to a lesser extent, Texas. In a simple average of eight Florida polls conducted since Jan. 1, Biden leads Trump 48 percent to 46 percent. And in a simple average of eight Arizona polls so far this year, Biden leads Trump 47 percent to 45 percent. But Biden still trails Trump, 48 percent to 44 percent, in a simple average of this year\u2019s Texas polls. Still, that would be remarkably close for a state that Mitt Romney carried by nearly 16 points in 2012.\n\nObviously, these numbers can change; general-election polls have yet to come into their full predictive value. But if Biden does carry one or more of these states, he could have their high rate of urbanization to thank.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Our 2020 Election Priors", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-urban-or-rural-is-your-state-and-what-does-that-mean-for-the-2020-election/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich"]}, {"title": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107 And The Mavs Are Pushing The Limits Of Offensive Efficiency", "text": "A few weeks ago, Chris Herring wrote about just how historically dominant the 2019-20 Milwaukee Bucks have been on defense, a fact that has gone somewhat unnoticed as Giannis Antetokounmpo and his sharpshooting friends have cruised through the league this year.

Dallas currently leads the NBA in offensive efficiency with 116.8 points per 100 possessions; that\u2019s 6.4 points of efficiency better than the league average this season, which is the 30th-best margin over average in NBA history.

Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nAny way you measure it, this Mavs attack is scoring at one of the most efficient rates ever. And a lot of the credit has rightly gone to second-year guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107, who is on the short list of this year\u2019s MVP candidates after winning Rookie of the Year honors last season. Among players with at least 895 minutes played this season, Don\u010di\u0107 ranks third on offense (behind only James Harden and Damian Lillard) in our RAPTOR metric with a rating of +7.7 \u2014 meaning we estimate that his offense has been worth a shade under 8 more points than an average player for every 100 possessions his team plays.\n\nIs that a lot? Why yes, it is. Historically speaking, there have been only 31 individual seasons (including those from Harden and Lillard) since the 1976 ABA merger in which a player logged at least 1,500 minutes and had an offensive RAPTOR better than Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s has been this year. And Don\u010di\u0107 is easily the youngest player in the sample to produce this kind of offensive season, in his age-20 season (as of Feb. 1). Nobody on the list above him did it at age 21; Chris Paul was the youngest, at age 22 back in 2007-08.\n\nAlthough Don\u010di\u0107 still has room to improve as a long-range shooter \u2014 his 3-point accuracy of 31.5 percent ranks 140th out of 147 qualified players this season \u2014 the rest of his offensive statistics have been stellar. Don\u010di\u0107 excels at creating chances for others; he\u2019s assisted on 45.6 percent of teammate baskets while in the game. He\u2019s also great at creating for himself: He has a true shooting percentage of 58.3 percent with a usage rate of 37.0 percent, numbers that are particularly impressive when you realize that only 18.2 percent of his buckets have been assisted by a teammate (the fourth-lowest rate in the league). With his tremendous ability to get to the rim, absorb contact and finish the play, Don\u010di\u0107 is generating 115.9 points per 100 possessions while also personally finishing 38.4 percent of the Mavs\u2019 possessions that he\u2019s on the court for \u2014 numbers that are in rarified territory on the usage-vs.-efficiency skill curve.\n\nSo with Don\u010di\u0107 playing 54.9 percent of Dallas\u2019s available minutes at a +7.7 RAPTOR offensive clip, we would expect a totally average team that added him to instantly outscore a typical offense by 3.4 points per 100 possessions. But as we mentioned before, the Mavericks as a team have actually been 6.4 points per 100 better than average \u2014 meaning Dallas\u2019s standout offensive season has been about more than just Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s individual excellence.\n\nAccording to Basketball-Reference.com, seven members of the 2019-20 Mavericks have played at least one-third of the team\u2019s available minutes and generated at least 115 points per 100 possessions: Don\u010di\u0107 (115.9), Dorian Finney-Smith (121.6), Tim Hardaway Jr. (116.4), Maxi Kleber (123.4), Seth Curry (124.4), Delon Wright (121.2) and Dwight Powell (133.8). (Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is is notably absent from the list; his individual offensive rating of 109.6 is the lowest of Dallas\u2019s regulars, though he is second on the team in usage rate among those playing at least a third of available minutes.) Going back to 1976, no team in modern history has ever finished a season with this many players logging such regular minutes at such high levels of efficiency.\n\nThe Mavs are overflowing with efficient players NBA teams with the most players who played at least one-third of available team minutes and had an individual offensive efficiency of at least 115 points per 100 possessions, 1976-2020 Team Year No. of Players List DAL 2020 7 Fin.-Smith, Hardaway, Don\u010di\u0107, Kleber, Curry, Wright, Powell DEN 2019 6 Joki\u0107, Morris, Millsap, Beasley, Plumlee, Hernang\u00f3mez PHO 1995 6 Majerle, Green, Barkley, Person, Ainge, Johnson CHI 1996 5 Jordan, Pippen, Kukoc, Kerr, Harper CHI 1997 5 Jordan, Pippen, Kerr, Harper, Kukoc HOU 2017 5 Harden, Anderson, Beverley, Capela, Dekker HOU 2020 5 Harden, Tucker, House, McLemore, Capela LAC 2020 5 Harrell, Leonard, Shamet, Beverley, Zubac LAL 1987 5 Johnson, Worthy, Scott, Cooper, Green LAL 1989 5 Worthy, Johnson, Green, Thompson, Cooper LAL 2020 5 James, Davis, Caldwell-Pope, Howard, McGee MIA 2020 5 Adebayo, Robinson, Butler, Jones, Olynyk OKC 2013 5 Durant, Ibaka, Sefolosha, Martin, Collison OKC 2016 5 Westbrook, Durant, Adams, Kanter, Roberson ORL 1995 5 O\u2019Neal, Hardaway, Grant, Anderson, Scott PHO 1993 5 Majerle, Barkley, Ainge, Johnson, Ceballos PHO 2009 5 Nash, O\u2019Neal, Stoudemire, Richardson, Barbosa PHO 2010 5 Stoudemire, Nash, Richardson, Frye, Dudley POR 2009 5 Roy, Blake, Fernandez, Przybilla, Batum TOR 2018 5 Lowry, Valanciunas, Poeltl, VanVleet, Wright UTA 1998 5 Malone, Hornacek, Russell, Keefe, Stockton Source: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nTo be sure, Don\u010di\u0107 has opened up many opportunities for his teammates to be efficient. According to Second Spectrum, there\u2019s been a potential assist on 57.3 percent of Dallas\u2019s non-Don\u010di\u0107 shots; for context, the Phoenix Suns are the team with the NBA\u2019s highest rate of potential assists per shot this season, at 57.0 percent. But his teammates still needed to convert on those chances, and they\u2019ve been doing an excellent job of it. Dallas has both seven regulars with a 3-point percentage over 35 percent and seven regulars with a 2-point field-goal percentage over 50 percent. Basically, the Mavericks almost never feature an inefficient offensive option on the floor at any given moment during a game.\n\nOf course, the abundance of 2019-20 teams on the list above shows just how much this efficiency-maximizing mentality has swept across the league, beyond just Luka and the Mavs. In the modern NBA, great offensive teams work like sophisticated machines, where all of the component pieces amplify each other\u2019s strengths. There\u2019s no place for a broken part in that apparatus, so coaches either have to find ways to help a player succeed or slot in a new player who won\u2019t be a liability. It\u2019s a testament to both Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s playmaking and the coaching of Rick Carlisle that Dallas has emerged with so many players performing so well in their roles.\n\nPerhaps an interesting comparison can be found in Dallas\u2019s previous generation of offensive juggernauts. The 2003-04 Mavs remain the greatest offensive team \u2014 relative to league average \u2014 in NBA history (see above), and they did it with four regulars who had an offensive rating over 115 points per 100: Dirk Nowitzki, Michael Finley, Steve Nash and Antawn Jamison. Nash and Nowitzki are particularly known as two of the greatest offensive forces to ever hit the hardwood, capable in their primes of lifting any offense to the top of the league, so it makes sense that they would combine to drive a historic offense. But that team also had a highly inefficient player right in the middle of it: Antoine Walker, who played nearly 72 percent of team minutes and used over 22 percent of possessions while on the court but generated just 100.7 points per 100 possessions.\n\nThough those Mavs were able to integrate him into their scheme and still score at an incredible rate, it\u2019s telling that there are hardly any Walkers to be found in today\u2019s best offenses. Instead, they are built more like the current Mavericks \u2014 a bunch of players who score at a hyper-efficient rate, all orbiting around one central Don\u010di\u0107-like figure who can do everything.\n\nCheck out our latest NBA predictions.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/luka-doncic-and-the-mavs-are-pushing-the-limits-of-offensive-efficiency/", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"title": "The Democratic Presidential Candidates Are Becoming Less Popular", "text": "Welcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nPoll(s) of the week\n\nBeing well-liked matters for presidential candidates: Generally speaking, they need to be at least somewhat popular to win.\n\nTo that effect, Monmouth University and Quinnipiac University each released a poll this week that asked voters whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of leading Democratic presidential candidates and President Trump, but what each pollster found was pretty different.\n\nThe Quinnipiac poll found that Trump received the worst marks overall \u2014 a net favorability rating (favorable rating minus unfavorable rating) of -17. This figure is 10 percentage points below the lowest-rated Democratic contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and 14 points worse than former Vice President Joe Biden, whose net favorability rating was -3. The Monmouth poll, on the other hand, put Trump\u2019s net favorability at -6, which made him more popular than any of the Democratic front-runners, with the exception of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg was actually the most well-liked candidate in both polls, but his standing is more in flux considering far fewer respondents knew enough about him to have an opinion, compared with those who said the same about Trump, Biden, Warren or Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Democratic primary, according to the early states\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? We know that many of 2020 front-runners aren\u2019t as popular as previous presidential contenders (at least at this point in the cycle), but among the general electorate, is Trump really as popular as many of the leading Democratic presidential contenders? To answer this question, we looked at all the national polls we could find since January (over 150 of them) that asked about how well-liked Trump and these candidates are. And as you can see in the chart below, despite one or two recent good polls for Trump, Trump remains really unpopular \u2014 far more than any of the leading Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nBut Democrats\u2019 net favorability ratings have taken a hit. As you can see in the chart above, even though Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg are nowhere near as unpopular as Trump, their net favorability ratings have trended downward recently. This isn\u2019t totally surprising, though, as my colleague Geoffrey Skelley noted a few weeks ago: Many presidential candidates\u2019 net favorability ratings have been negative or close to zero since at least 2008, a sign, perhaps, of the polarized times we live in.\n\nOf course, there is still time for public perception to change (in either direction) between now and November. But if the polls are any indication, opinions of the Democratic candidates seem much more likely to shift than opinions of Trump. That might be because people\u2019s opinions of the Democratic candidates aren\u2019t nearly as entrenched. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, told me that if you look at the breakdown of \u201csomewhat\u201d and \u201cvery\u201d favorable opinions for Trump and the Democratic candidates, \u201copinion about Trump is significantly more deeply held than opinion about any of the Democratic candidates right now.\u201d The same is true if you look at the breakdown of \u201csomewhat\u201d and \u201cvery\u201d unfavorable opinions for Trump and the Democratic candidates \u2014 Trump is much more actively disliked.\n\nOpinions are pretty set on Trump, but more flexible on Dems Share of respondents who said they had a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable or unfavorable opinion of President Trump and the four Democratic front-runners, according to an average of polls from Oct. 11 to Dec 11, 2019 Favorable Unfavorable Candidate Very Somewhat Difference Very Somewhat Difference Donald Trump 30.3 11.5 +18.8 47.8 9.5 +38.2 Joe Biden 19.4 24.9 -5.4 31.8 15.4 16.4 Bernie Sanders 20.7 23.1 -2.4 34.6 13.4 21.3 Elizabeth Warren 21.1 20.7 0.4 34.4 10.5 23.9 Pete Buttigieg 14.1 20.3 -6.2 23.3 12.4 10.9 Source: Polls\n\nSo though Trump may be less popular than his prospective Democratic opponents overall, he has a pretty high level of enthusiastic support \u2014 32 percent of respondents said they had a \u201cvery\u201d favorable opinion of him in an average of the last two months of polls. No Democratic contender has earned marks as high.\n\nThis isn\u2019t all that surprising considering Democrats still haven\u2019t settled on their nominee. Once they pick someone to take on Trump, this could all change, too, and the eventual Democratic nominee could end up even more unpopular than Trump \u2014 or maybe with an even more loyal fan base. We can\u2019t know at this point, but it does seem as if there is more opportunity for Democratic candidates to move public opinion \u2014 in either direction \u2014 than there is for Trump.\n\nOther polling bites\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of favorability ratings, the Monmouth and Quinnipiac polls mentioned above also had net favorability ratings for former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the most recent Democratic contender to enter the 2020 race. Unfortunately for Bloomberg, the results weren\u2019t very good. The Monmouth poll put his net approval among registered voters at -28 and the Quinnipiac poll at -19, making these the lowest marks that any one candidate received in both polls, including Trump. Ouch!\n\nHouse Democrats and the Trump administration reached a deal on Tuesday to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal that updates the current North American Free Trade Agreement.

The candidate with the fewest votes is then eliminated and his or her votes redistributed to each voters\u2019 next choice. This process is repeated until one candidate (the winner) is left.

That\u2019s likely because of the Oct. 15 primary debate \u2014 we\u2019ve noticed that the share of coverage for candidates who participated in debates in the past seemed to go up on debate week and down the week after, just as we see in the table below.\n\nTulsi Gabbard was mentioned more on cable last week Share of 15-second cable news clips mentioning each candidate vs. share of online stories mentioning each candidate in a Media Cloud search Cable TV clips the week of \u2026 online stories the week of \u2026 Candidate 10/13/19 10/20/19 diff 10/13/19 10/20/19 diff Joe Biden 44.1% 39.7% -4.4 59.2% 59.0% -0.2 Elizabeth Warren 26.3 23.0 -3.3 42.1 38.0 -4.1 Bernie Sanders 16.5 17.0 +0.5 34.9 30.0 -4.9 Pete Buttigieg 5.9 6.0 +0.1 19.9 18.2 -1.8 Tulsi Gabbard 7.6 15.4 +7.7 12.9 13.0 +0.1 Kamala Harris 3.8 3.8 +0.0 15.6 12.5 -3.1 Amy Klobuchar 3.8 3.3 -0.6 13.7 8.8 -4.9 Cory Booker 2.3 1.5 -0.8 11.4 7.6 -3.9 Andrew Yang 1.4 0.5 -0.9 9.9 6.0 -3.9 Beto O\u2019Rourke 3.6 2.0 -1.7 5.6 4.0 -1.6 Tom Steyer 2.4 1.8 -0.6 9.6 3.4 -6.3 Tim Ryan 0.0 1.1 +1.1 0.9 2.4 +1.4 Michael Bennet 0.0 0.1 +0.1 1.5 2.1 +0.6 Juli\u00e1n Castro 0.7 0.9 +0.2 3.2 1.9 -1.3 Marianne Williamson 0.2 0.2 +0.0 2.0 1.6 -0.4 John Delaney 0.1 0.2 +0.1 1.2 1.2 -0.1 Steve Bullock 0.1 0.1 +0.0 1.1 0.9 -0.2 Joe Sestak 0.0 0.0 +0.0 0.8 0.3 -0.5 Includes all candidates that qualify as \u201cmajor\u201d in FiveThirtyEight\u2019s rubric.

Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard was mentioned in almost twice as many cable news clips this week compared to last. Much of the cable news attention came when former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton suggested that Gabbard was being groomed by the Russians for a third-party run to undermine Democrats\u2019 chances in 2020. In fact, the most common words mentioned in 15-second clips mentioning Gabbard were \u201cHillary,\u201d \u201cClinton,\u201d \u201cRussian\u201d and \u201casset.\u201d\n\nBut Gabbard didn\u2019t get the same amount of attention across networks last week. She was mentioned in 66 clips on CNN and 71 clips on MSNBC, but 339 clips (almost five times as many) on Fox News.\n\nCheck out the data behind this series and check back each week for an update on which candidates are getting the most coverage on cable news.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-media-frenzy-around-biden-is-fading/", "author": ["Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "Introducing RAPTOR, Our New Metric For The Modern NBA", "text": "Introducing RAPTOR, Our New Metric For The Modern NBA Our scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn\u2019t stop to think if they should.\n\nAt FiveThirtyEight, we\u2019ve been running NBA predictions since 2015. We started with Elo ratings before introducing our CARMELO player projection system, which we then incorporated into our \u201cCARM-Elo\u201d season prediction model. We tested and tweaked the prediction model over the years, but it was always powered by metrics from other sources, such as Box Plus/Minus (BPM) and Real Plus-Minus (RPM).\n\nBut that changes this year. RAPTOR, which stands for Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings, is FiveThirtyEight\u2019s new NBA statistic. We\u2019re pretty excited about it. In addition to being a statistic that we bake in house, RAPTOR fulfills two long-standing goals of ours:\n\nFirst, we wanted to create a publicly available statistic that takes advantage of modern NBA data, specifically player tracking and play-by-play data that isn\u2019t available in traditional box scores.\n\nSecond, and relatedly, we wanted a statistic that better reflects how modern NBA teams actually evaluate players.\n\nNBA teams highly value floor spacing, defense and shot creation, and they place relatively little value on traditional big-man skills. RAPTOR likewise values these things \u2014 not because we made any deliberate attempt to design the system that way but because the importance of those skills emerges naturally from the data. RAPTOR thinks ball-dominant players such as James Harden and Steph Curry are phenomenally good. It highly values two-way wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It can have a love-hate relationship with centers, who are sometimes overvalued in other statistical systems. But it appreciates modern centers such as Nikola Joki\u0107 and Joel Embiid, as well as defensive stalwarts like Rudy Gobert.\n\nOur sports podcast, Hot Takedown, discusses RAPTOR\n\nThis article will go over some of the highlights of how RAPTOR works. For a much deeper and more technical description, you can find our methodological explainer here. But these are the highlights:\n\nLike BPM and RPM, RAPTOR is a plus-minus statistic that measures the number of points a player contributes to his team\u2019s offense and defense per 100 possessions, relative to a league-average player. For instance, a player with an offensive RAPTOR rating of +2.1 boosts his team\u2019s performance by 2.1 points per 100 offensive possessions while he is on the floor. Likewise, a player with a defensive RAPTOR of +3.4 would improve his team\u2019s defensive performance by 3.4 points per 100 possessions while he\u2019s on the court.\n\nPlus-minus statistics have certain inherent limitations, and RAPTOR is subject to those, too. Namely, these statistics assume that player performance is largely linear and additive, that is, that you can roughly add up the ratings from individual players to project team performance. In other words, RAPTOR does not account for coaching, systems or synergies between teammates.\n\nRAPTOR consists of two major components that are blended together to rate players: a \u201cbox\u201d (as in \u201cbox score\u201d) component, which uses individual statistics (including statistics derived from player tracking and play-by-play data), and an \u201con-off\u201d component, which evaluates a team\u2019s performance when the player and various combinations of his teammates are on or off the floor.\n\nThe variables included in \u201cbox\u201d RAPTOR were chosen by evaluating how they did in predicting long-term RAPM (real adjusted plus-minus), which is a measure of how a team\u2019s performance changes when the player is on and off the floor. Essentially, this is the same technique that BPM used, only RAPTOR uses play-by-play and player tracking statistics in addition to traditional ones. On offense, for instance, in addition to using traditional statistics like points, RAPTOR accounts for factors such as how many of a player\u2019s field goals were assisted and how valuable these assists were, the value of different types of offensive rebounds, time of possession and various measures of floor spacing, such as the number of contested 3-pointers that the player took. On defense, it looks at factors like how often the player was the nearest defender on an opponents\u2019 shot and how often those shots went in, how many points and rebounds were scored by opponents at the defender\u2019s position, and how often the player induced offensive fouls.\n\nThe \u201con-off\u201d element of RAPTOR evaluates how a player\u2019s team performed while he was on the floor, how the player\u2019s courtmates (the teammates that the player most often shared the court with) performed while they were on the floor without the player, and, finally, how those courtmates\u2019 other courtmates performed when they were on the floor without the player\u2019s courtmates, all adjusted for the strength of competition they were facing. We know it might sound a little goofy. But it\u2019s relatively simple to calculate. And it correlates very well with RAPM, while stabilizing a lot faster than RAPM, which can take years\u2019 worth of data to estimate reliably.\n\nthe player, and, finally, how those courtmates\u2019 other courtmates performed when they were on the floor without the player\u2019s courtmates, all adjusted for the strength of competition they were facing. We know it might sound a little goofy. But it\u2019s relatively simple to calculate. And it correlates very well with RAPM, while stabilizing a lot faster than RAPM, which can take years\u2019 worth of data to estimate reliably. Overall, however, RAPTOR weights the \u201cbox\u201d component more highly than the \u201con-off\u201d component. In testing RAPTOR on out-of-sample data, we found that while on-court/off-court stats provide useful information, they\u2019re nonetheless quite noisy as compared with individual measures of player value that are used in the \u201cbox\u201d part of RAPTOR.\n\nWhen applied to past data \u2014 for instance, in evaluating who the best players were in the 2018-19 season \u2014 RAPTOR is a descriptive statistic. Descriptive RAPTOR is based solely on a player\u2019s on-court performance and the performance of the player\u2019s teammates, as described above. It does not use priors based on a player\u2019s height, weight, age or any other factor.\n\nstatistic.

It does not use priors based on a player\u2019s height, weight, age or any other factor. However, RAPTOR can also be used to make team and player predictions, and indeed our NBA predictions are now fueled by RAPTOR. (We are retiring the CARMELO brand name from our previous projection system, although much of the code for RAPTOR projections is borrowed from CARMELO.) RAPTOR-driven predictions do use qualities such as height, age and draft position, and even whether a player recently appeared on an All-NBA team \u2014 that data improves the performance of the predictive measure. Predictions also weight variables slightly differently than descriptive RAPTOR does, as certain statistics are more subject to luck than others. We refer to this predictive version of RAPTOR as PREDATOR (PREDictive rApTOR).\n\nRAPTOR is based exclusively on publicly available data. There are other player-tracking statistics we believe could be highly helpful to RAPTOR, especially more detailed measures of on-ball defense, so we hope to be able to revisit RAPTOR as additional data becomes available.\n\nRAPTOR\u2019s name (in addition to being a whimsical backronym in the tradition of CARMELO and DRAYMOND) honors the 2018-19 Toronto Raptors, which FiveThirtyEight\u2019s previous projection system correctly predicted had an edge over the Golden State Warriors (even though we didn\u2019t fully believe the projection ourselves at the time).\n\nThe full-fledged version of RAPTOR is available for the 2013-14 season onward, as that\u2019s when the NBA\u2019s player-tracking data came on line. We also have a historical version of RAPTOR called Approximate RAPTOR dating back to 1976-1977, the first season after the ABA-NBA merger, but that uses a far more limited range of data.\n\nRAPTOR ratings for players with at least 1,000 minutes played in a season since 2013-14 can be found in the table below. As you can see, RAPTOR generally loves perimeter players and wings, such as Curry, Harden, Leonard and Chris Paul, although some frontcourt players like Jokic, Anthony Davis and Draymond Green are also rated highly by the system. For more detail on past RAPTORs, including the breakdown of box and on-off components, you can download files that list the regular season and playoffs separately, or a version that combines a player\u2019s appearances over the course of the entire season into one file.\n\nRAPTOR \u2764\ufe0fs Steph, Harden, CP3 and Kawhi RAPTOR ratings for players with at least 1,000 minutes played,

The ball hit a 2-year-old girl, who was rushed out of the stadium. The game stopped as an emotional Almora dropped to a knee. Less than two weeks later, as the Washington Nationals played the White Sox in Chicago, a woman sitting just past the third-base dugout was struck in the face. Less than two weeks after that, a Dodger Stadium spectator sitting just past the netting on the first-base line was hit in the head by a hard line drive off the bat of right fielder Cody Bellinger.\n\nBloomberg News estimated in 2014 that 1,750 fans per year are hurt by batted balls at MLB games. Amid debates over how much protection teams should offer spectators, we wanted to find out which areas of stadiums might be the most dangerous, which could help us figure out what could be done to prevent more fan injuries.\n\nBecause there\u2019s no central database of all of MLB\u2019s foul balls, we had to compile a data set ourselves. To do that, we searched the batted-ball data for this season on Baseball Savant to find the 10 stadiums that produced the most foul balls up to June 5 and then analyzed the pitch-level data from the most foul-heavy game day at each of those stadiums (including one doubleheader). Because we had to individually research each foul ball, we couldn\u2019t look at a whole season\u2019s worth of fouls. By limiting the data set to the most foul-heavy days of play in those 10 stadiums, we aimed to keep the data set to a manageable size while also capturing the largest number of fouls we could from a variety of parks, since stadiums vary dramatically in architecture, altitude and seating arrangements.\n\nDozens of fouls per game in the most foul-heavy parks The most foul-heavy day at each of the 10 stadiums that produced the most fouls this season, as of June 5 Most foul-heavy day Stadium Average No. of Fouls per game Date Matchup No. of Fouls Camden Yards* 57 4/20/19 Baltimore Orioles vs. Minnesota Twins 113 PNC Park 57 6/1/19 Pittsburgh Pirates vs. Milwaukee Brewers 111 Oakland Coliseum 53 6/2/19 Oakland A\u2019s vs. Houston Astros 109 T-Mobile Park 53 5/18/19 Seattle Mariners vs. Minnesota Twins 100 Globe Life Park 55 5/3/19 Texas Rangers vs. Toronto Blue Jays 87 Dodger Stadium 51 3/29/19 Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Arizona Diamondsbacks 86 Miller Park 55 5/4/19 Milwaukee Brewers vs. New York Mets 85 Citizens Bank Park 53 4/27/19 Philadelphia Phillies vs. Miami Marlins 75 SunTrust Park 53 4/14/19 Atlanta Braves vs. New York Mets 73 Yankee Stadium 51 3/31/19 New York Yankees vs. Baltimore Orioles 67 * Includes both games of the doubleheader Source: Baseball Savant\n\nWe watched clips of 906 foul balls hit during those games (excluding foul tips, which were never in danger of reaching the stands, and fouls that resulted in outs, because Baseball Savant groups those with other types of caught-ball outs, so we couldn\u2019t get data on foul outs specifically), and we recorded whether the fouls were grounders, fly balls, line drives or pop-ups. Then we split the parks into \u201czones\u201d to categorize the general area where each of those balls landed.\n\nZones 1, 2 and 3 include seats that are largely protected by netting \u2014 the area behind home plate and both dugouts \u2014 along with the corresponding areas of foul territory on the field. Zones 4 and 5 are mostly non-netted seating areas and the foul territory outside the baselines, from the dugout to the foul pole. Zones 6 and 7 cover the areas past the foul poles; the fly balls that land here typically have too much arc to be dangerous, and line drives rarely make it that far.\n\nLess than half of the foul balls we charted were followed by a camera to where they landed. But by gauging angles, we estimated where all of the fouls \u2014 both those that were followed by a camera and those that weren\u2019t \u2014 likely landed. We tested our predictions against the footage of the balls that were followed to check our accuracy.\n\nNearly equal shares of foul balls ended up in zones with netting vs. zones that largely lack netting: 454 balls landed in zones 1, 2 and 3, while 452 balls fell in zones 4 through 7.\n\nThe scariest foul balls are those with high exit velocities, particularly the line drives, which give spectators only seconds \u2014 or fractions of a second \u2014 to react. Statcast was able to measure exit velocities for 580 of the 906 foul balls in our data set, and most of the hardest-hit of those 580 landed in areas that are primarily unprotected. Of the fly balls with recorded exit velocities of 90 mph or higher, 71.8 percent landed in zones 4 and 5. And all of the line drives that left the bat at 90 mph or more landed in those same zones. That\u2019s the type of hit that injured the toddler at this year\u2019s Cubs-Astros game or that blinded a man in one eye at Wrigley Field in 2017.\n\nMajor league stadiums have slowly been installing more netting around the field. Players have been pushing the issue, including Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill, who called the MLB Players Association to voice his support for more protective netting. In 2015, MLB encouraged teams to extend netting to the \u201cnear ends of both dugouts.\u201d By 2018, all 30 stadiums had exceeded that recommendation, installing netting from one end of the dugout to the other. After the incident at Guaranteed Rate Field, the White Sox announced that they would implement netting from foul pole to foul pole, and crews worked during the All-Star break to install the new nets. The Washington Nationals also used the break to add netting.\n\nBut more netting won\u2019t protect every fan. Linda Goldbloom was sitting high above home plate in Dodger Stadium \u2014 in zone 1, where netting is provided \u2014 last year when she was struck and killed by a high fly ball that had an exit velocity of just 73 mph. And a woman at Tropicana Field was hospitalized in 2016 after she was hit by a fly ball that found its way through a hole in the netting just to the left of the first-base dugout.\n\nThe efforts that other leagues make to ensure the safety of their spectators could serve as a blueprint for MLB. Take the Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball Organization, where the stadiums have netting from foul pole to foul pole. Whenever a ball is hit into the stands, fans are warned with loud whistles blown by staff stationed in their seating section, and animated warning videos are played before every game. As a result, unprotected seats are something of a luxury in Japan. The Tokyo Dome offers \u201cexciting seats\u201d near the foul lines, which come equipped with helmets and gloves.\n\nEven with extensive netting, no one will ever be completely safe at a baseball game. But there are ways for MLB to protect its fans from foul balls \u2014 particularly in the most dangerous areas of the park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that you just hold your breath for a second,\u201d Hill told The Los Angeles Times. \u201cYou just hope it hits a seat, not a person.\u201d\n\nNeil Paine contributed research.\n\nCheck out our latest MLB predictions.\n\nCORRECTION (July 15, 2019, 5 p.m.): A previous version of this story referred to the data as having been collected from the 10 most foul-ball-heavy games this season. It was actually collected from the 10 most foul-ball-heavy game days \u2014 one day included a doubleheader.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-watched-906-foul-balls-to-find-out-where-the-most-dangerous-ones-land/", "author": ["Annette Choi"]}, {"title": "What Our Inbox Tells Us About How Democrats Are Tackling Trump", "text": "Democrats running for president in 2020 are faced with a choice when making their pitch to voters: make attacking President Trump a key part of their message or ignore him and focus on introducing themselves and their ideas.\n\nOn the one hand, criticizing Trump could help candidates convince primary voters that they\u2019re able to defeat him, but depending on what shots they choose to take, they could risk alienating voters in the general election. So we wanted to see how the candidates tackled this choice by looking at one of the most direct ways they regularly communicate with voters \u2014 their emails.\n\nLindsey Cormack, who runs the DCinbox project, a public database of email newsletters sent by members of Congress, says emails, like tweets, can give us insight into how politicians try to brand themselves. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to deal with editors at the paper. They don\u2019t have to deal with booking an agent to be on a TV or radio program. They can really say anything they want.\u201d\n\nSo to get a better sense of what the candidates told their followers about Trump, we subscribed to the mailing list of every candidate that FiveThirtyEight considers \u201cmajor\u201d and looked at all the emails they sent in the month prior to the first Democratic debate. (Though, for a variety of reasons \u2014 including email targeting practices, engagement testing techniques and the fact that we haven\u2019t given money to any of these campaigns \u2014 we may not have received all the emails sent by all the campaigns. )\n\nOverall, the candidates have taken very different approaches. Some candidates, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, seem to be ignoring Trump almost entirely, while others, like former Vice President Joe Biden, are heavily peppering their emails with invocations of Trump. Even some lesser-known candidates like Montana Gov. Steve Bullock are going all in on Trump \u2014 every email we received from his campaign during this period contained a reference to the president.\n\nBiden\u2019s emails contained the second-most mentions of Trump. In total, we received 27 messages from his campaign that referenced the president by name. This strong focus on Trump seems aimed at portraying Biden as a strong general election candidate, which makes sense, as his perceived \u201celectability\u201d has been a central argument of his campaign.\n\nIn his emails, Biden has attacked Trump\u2019s campaign tactics, his policy stances and his values. Biden has even sent an email that, rather than concentrating on his campaign, asked readers to sign a petition to \u201ctell Donald Trump that welcoming foreign interference in our elections is unacceptable.\u201d Even many of Biden\u2019s fundraising emails are all about Trump, asking readers to \u201cimagine the shock on Trump\u2019s face\u201d when they hit their fundraising goal and collect enough to \u201ccompete with Trump\u2019s fortunes.\u201d\n\nWhile Biden mentions Trump often, his emails completely ignore the rest of the primary field \u2014 none of his messages mention another Democratic candidate by name. Another thing Biden never mentions? Impeachment.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a telling omission, because many other candidates have called for Trump\u2019s impeachment and are renewing those calls in their emails. The move could help them in the primary election, as impeachment is popular among Democrats, but could prove risky in a general election because most polls find that more Americans oppose impeachment than support it.\n\nIn the month leading up to the first debate, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Cabinet secretary Julian Castro, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Sen. Cory Booker, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and former Gov. John Hickenlooper all sent at least one email entirely devoted to calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment. O\u2019Rourke, for example, sent a long email on May 30 explaining why he thought Trump should be impeached, and then a punchier one about two weeks later with \u201cDonald Trump\u201d as the subject line and \u201c\u2026 should be impeached\u201d as the only text in the body of the email, with a link to a petition.\n\nWhile Warren was the first 2020 Democratic candidate to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2014 she publicly embraced that stance after the April release of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 we didn\u2019t receive any emails from her campaign that mentioned the topic in the month before the first debate. Likewise, Sanders has also called for Trump\u2019s impeachment, but didn\u2019t send us any impeachment emails during the period we looked at.\n\nSome candidates largely avoided talking about Trump at all in the month before the debate. For example, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg only mentioned Trump in one email, when he called Trump\u2019s tariffs on Mexican goods \u201cpolitically-motivated gamesmanship.\u201d Warren also was largely silent on Trump in this period. Of the 56 emails she sent us that month, only four mentioned Trump, and of those four, only one focused on him for the bulk of the message. That email explained, \u201cOur campaign isn\u2019t about Donald Trump. That\u2019s because he\u2019s just the symptom, not the cause, of the crises we face as a country.\u201d And Rep. Tim Ryan, who sent us 78 emails \u2014 the most of any candidate \u2014 didn\u2019t mention Trump even once, although he, too, has called for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nBullock, on the other hand, mentioned Trump in every single email, often as part of a formulaic reminder to subscribers that he is the only presidential candidate to have won statewide office in a state Trump won.\n\nCandidates who have a harder time making an \u201celectability\u201d argument than Bullock varied widely in the tenor of their emails that mentioned Trump. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, for example, sent us fewer emails in the month leading up to the debate than most candidates, but he mentioned Trump in five of the seven emails he did send us. (And one the two that didn\u2019t mention the president\u2019s last name still used the hashtag #ConDon, which showed up in six of de Blasio\u2019s emails and is meant to imply that Trump is a con man.) In many ways, De Blasio seemed to be trying to out-Trump Trump, aggressively attacking him and using name-calling tactics that the president is known for. In one email, for instance, he called Trump a \u201cNew York con man who\u2019s just been made to smell his own BS\u201d and referred to Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s lawyer, as Trump\u2019s \u201clapdog,\u201d whose insults were \u201ceven lamer than his boss\u2019s.\u201d But unlike de Blasio, most of the Democratic contenders seemed to have heeded former First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s advice to \u201cgo high\u201d when their opponents \u201cgo low\u201d and are trying to strike a different tone than the current president, rather than trying to outdo him.\n\nSo what does this tell us about how Democrats are crafting (or not crafting) their campaigns around Trump? Well, a few candidates, like de Blasio, Bullock and Biden, are at one extreme \u2014 mentioning Trump at practically every opportunity \u2014 and a few, like Ryan and Buttigieg, are firmly planted at the other extreme, remaining largely silent on Trump. But perhaps unsurprisingly, most candidates fall somewhere in between, striking a balance between talking about Trump and focusing on their own message. It\u2019s early yet, though, and some candidates\u2019 communication strategies might change as the primary progresses. Still, with so many Democrats running, the party will have collectively tried out many different avenues of attack before the general election. Ultimately, however, there will only be one Democratic nominee, and whoever that is, he or she will have a wide pool of pre-tested approaches to draw from.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-democrats-are-campaigning-on-trump/", "author": ["Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "A Better Way To Evaluate NBA Defense", "text": "Basketball, in some sense, is fundamentally a shooting game. Shooting isn\u2019t the only important action that takes place on a basketball court, obviously. But if no one kept track of who was taking shots and making buckets, we\u2019d have, at best, an extremely fuzzy impression of which players were actually any good, even if we had access to all their other statistics.\n\nBut believe it or not, this had long been the situation when it came to measuring player defense. There are individual defensive statistics such as rebounds and steals, of course. But there\u2019s no direct measure of shooting defense (other than blocks, which account for a relatively small fraction of missed shots). If an opponent gets hot against your team and shoots 53 for 91 en route to scoring 130 points, we know your team defended poorly in the aggregate, but we don\u2019t know which players to blame.\n\nThat is, until a few years ago, when the NBA started publishing data on opponents\u2019 shooting. Last regular season, for example, NBA Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert defended a league-high 1,426 shots, according to motion tracking data by Second Spectrum, which identifies the nearest defender on every field goal attempt. Opponents made only 45 percent of those field goal attempts, well below the roughly 49 percent that Second Spectrum estimates \u201cshould\u201d have gone in against average defense for a given distance to the basket.\n\nWe\u2019ve been obsessed with this opponents\u2019 shooting data for a while, in part because it sometimes seemed to track closely with players who had stronger or weaker defensive reputations than you would infer from other advanced statistics such as Real Plus-Minus. Boston\u2019s Kyrie Irving was regarded as a slightly above-average defender by RPM last year, for instance. But his opponents\u2019 shooting data suggests he\u2019s a big liability instead. On the other hand, Toronto\u2019s Serge Ibaka was an excellent defender based on opponents\u2019 shooting, whereas RPM regards him as just average.\n\nSo this year, we decided to evaluate the opponents\u2019 shooting data in a more comprehensive way and incorporate it into our projection system, CARMELO. Just as CARMELO is a goofy backronym (Career-Arc Regression Model Estimator with Local Optimization) that honors one of our favorite players, Carmelo Anthony, we decided to give our new defensive rating a player-centric name, this time in honor of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Draymond Green, who has long been one of the best players in basketball by opponent shooting. So our new rating is called DRAYMOND, which stands for\u2026.\n\nDefensive\n\nRating\n\nAccounting for\n\nYielding\n\nMinimal\n\nOpenness by\n\nNearest\n\nDefender\n\n\ud83d\ude44\n\nAll right, so the acronym may or may not catch on. But it does get at one essential discovery we made in playing around with the opponents\u2019 shooting data: the idea of minimizing openness. The main goal of shooting defense, especially in today\u2019s spacing-centric, ball-movement-forward offensive era, is really to minimize the chance of an open shot.\n\nSo when I cited Gobert\u2019s numbers earlier in this article, for instance, the most impressive part was not that opponents shot poorly against him, although that helped the Jazz, of course. Rather, it was that he was the nearest defender on so many shots: about 26 shots per 100 possessions that he was on the floor last year as compared with a league average of about 17 shots defended per 100 possessions. By contrast, Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook \u2014 whom DRAYMOND regards as being vastly overrated by other defensive metrics \u2014 was the nearest defender on only 12 shots per 100 possessions. Some of this has to do with Westbrook\u2019s and Gobert\u2019s respective positions \u2014 centers naturally defend more shots than guards do, a factor that DRAYMOND corrects for (see below). But even accounting for that, it\u2019s clear that some players are much more impactful defenders than others.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re curious to see some data, but first, an explanation of how DRAYMOND is calculated. We\u2019ll keep it pretty brief.\n\nAs I mentioned above, what we\u2019re really interested in is how much value a defender provides relative to an open shot. That is to say, we generally don\u2019t want to punish a player for happening to be the nearest defender according to the Second Spectrum data. Some defense is generally better than none; if Player X hadn\u2019t defended the shot, it\u2019s possible that no one else would have.\n\nThrough trial and error, we found that DRAYMOND performs best if you assume that shooting percentages on open shots are about 8 percentage points higher than against average defense. For instance, if a certain type of above-the-break 3-pointer is made 34 percent of the time against average defense, we\u2019d expect it to go in about 42 percent of the time if it was truly open.\n\nThis allows us to calculate an initial score that we call RAW_DRAYMOND. For example, if a player faced 100 2-point shots and allowed 46 of them to go in when you\u2019d expect 56 percent of them to be converted if wide open, that player prevented \u2026\n\n(.56-.46) x 100 x 2 = 20\n\n\u2026 about 20 points from being scored with his defense. (Obviously, this player could have provided additional value based on his defense against 3-point shots. Indeed, since 3-point shots are worth more than 2-pointers \u2014 hashtag #math \u2014 players who are effective at defending threes are especially rewarded by DRAYMOND.)\n\nHowever, there are several adjustments we need to make in getting from RAW_DRAYMOND to regular DRAYMOND:\n\nSince DRAYMOND is based on both regular-season and playoff data, we adjust for the fact that defenders face slightly tougher shooters on average in the playoffs.\n\nWe divide RAW_DRAYMOND by the number of possessions that the player was on the floor, so that DRAYMOND (like RPM and most other NBA stats) is a rate statistic rather than a counting statistic.\n\nWe adjust the number of shots defended based on a player\u2019s position. The average point guard and shooting guard defends about 15 shots per 100 possessions, the average small forward defends about 16 shots, the average power forward 19 shots, and the average center 22 shots. This somewhat equalizes defensive value over the five positions. Even so, bigs are generally the most valuable defenders in basketball according to DRAYMOND, as they are under most other advanced statistics.\n\nFinally, we subtract the value of league-average shooting defense per possession from each player\u2019s score. Thus, like RPM and Box Plus/Minus (BPM), the statistics that CARMELO has traditionally used to make its projections, DRAYMOND is a plus-minus statistic measured per 100 possessions, where a score of 0 represents average defense.\n\nAmong players who have played at least 10,000 possessions over the past six seasons (the NBA\u2019s opponents\u2019 shooting data goes back to 2013-14), the top defender according to DRAYMOND is \u2026 Draymond Green, who has provided the Warriors with +3.2 points per 100 possessions of defensive value based on his scoring defense alone, not counting all of the other ways (e.g., steals) that he produces defensive value. Green is followed on the list by a fairly star-studded cast of defenders: Joel Embiid, Kristaps Porzingis (!), Rudy Gobert, Tim Duncan, Andre Roberson and Anthony Davis.

To test this \u2014 and I have to apologize because there are a lot of similarly named statistics here with confusing acronyms \u2014 we regressed DRAYMOND and defensive BPM against five-year defensive Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (RAPM). What the hell does that mean? BPM is based on conventional box score statistics \u2014 most importantly rebounds, blocks and steals for the purposes of measuring defense. DRAYMOND is based on opponents\u2019 shooting. RAPM, meanwhile, measures how much better or worse a team plays when a player is on or off the floor. In the long run, RAPM is basically the \u201cright\u201d way to measure player value, since it can account for all the direct and indirect contributions a player makes that may or may not have a corresponding statistic attached to them. In the short run and even the medium run, however (remember all that misleading data people cited about how the Warriors were so good without Kevin Durant?), RAPM can be extremely noisy. So RAPM is great if you\u2019re looking back over a five-year sample, as we\u2019re doing here, but on-court/off-court statistics need to be treated with extreme caution over small samples.\n\nIn any event, what we found is that BPM and DRAYMOND basically do equally well in predicting long-term RAPM. What that means is that the opponents\u2019 shooting data is basically as powerful as all box score defensive statistics combined in predicting how much value a player\u2019s defense truly has over the long run.\n\nWe also found, however, that BPM and DRAYMOND are largely not redundant with one another. Blocks, steals and rebounds, which BPM captures, are certainly valuable things, and DRAYMOND does not purport to measure those. But they are also not especially good proxies for shooting defense. There are some players such as Green and Gobert who are even better defenders than you\u2019d gather from their box score stats, even though those stats are pretty good. But there are others like Trevor Ariza, who gets lots of steals but has been rated poorly by DRAYMOND in recent seasons. That doesn\u2019t mean that Ariza is a poor defender, just that you need to take the good (steals) with the bad (allows opponents to convert field goals at a high rate) when evaluating him.\n\nLet\u2019s conclude with a list of players who are most affected, positively or negatively, by the incorporation of DRAYMOND. The table below compares our old CARMELO defensive ratings, which were based on a mix of two-thirds RPM and one-third BPM, to our new version, which still uses these statistics but also uses DRAYMOND. Here are the old and new defensive ratings for everyone with at least 10,000 possessions played since 2013-14.\n\nWhich players\u2019 defense had been underrated or overrated?

Porzingis, Embiid, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant are among the players whose defense had been most underrated by BPM and RPM. There\u2019s also new Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker and, in something of a surprise, former Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas, who still rates as a pretty terrible defender, just not quite as terrible as before when you incorporate his DRAYMOND data. The most overrated defenders include players such as Westbrook, Rondo, Ariza, Otto Porter Jr. and Nikola Jokic.\n\nCases such as Thompson and Westbrook are interesting because the conventional wisdom has been way off from where the advanced metrics have them. RPM and BPM say that Westbrook is the much better defensive player, when a lot of NBA general managers might prefer Thompson or at least would regard it as close. But Thompson is a good defender according to DRAYMOND, whereas Westbrook is a wretched one, which closes at least some of the gap. Undoubtedly, there are even better ways to use opponents\u2019 shooting data than what we\u2019ve established with DRAYMOND, but the data ought to be a central part of the conversation about player defense going forward.\n\nWe used math to help LeBron cast \u2018Space Jam 2\u2019\n\nCheck out our NBA player ratings.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-better-way-to-evaluate-nba-defense/", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"title": "The State Of The State Of The States", "text": "Whether it\u2019s a groundbreaking experiment of conservative or liberal thought or \u201cmerely\u201d tending to the bread-and-butter issues that touch residents\u2019 lives, the states are where the policymaking magic happens. And because of the different roles played by the state and federal governments, what\u2019s happening in the states can vary pretty substantially from what\u2019s being discussed on the national level. So we decided to burst out of the bubble of the national 2020 campaign and take a look at what state leaders were talking about.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, each governor lays out their policy priorities in their version of the State of the Union address \u2014 a \u201cstate of the state\u201d address. We conducted a text analysis of all 50 governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches to see what issues were talked about the most and whether there were differences between what Democratic and Republican governors were focusing on. Specifically, we broke down the speeches into one-, two- and three-word phrases (like \u201cschool\u201d or the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) and divided the most commonly used ones into thematic buckets.\n\nWe found that the three most dominant issues were education, health care and the economy \u2014 although Democratic and Republican governors didn\u2019t always approach them in the same way. There were also interesting partisan differences in how governors talked about some other issues, including the environment, crime and justice, and mental health.\n\nEducation\n\nThe words \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cschool\u201d appeared in all 23 Democratic speeches and all 27 Republican ones. But that doesn\u2019t mean the two parties focused on the same aspects of education. To suss out those differences, we ran a statistical analysis to determine how significantly terms were associated with speeches from Democratic or Republican governors. And as you can see in the table below, some terms (e.g., \u201cchild care,\u201d \u201ckindergarten\u201d) were more likely to be used in Democratic speeches, while others (e.g., \u201cfoster care,\u201d \u201ceducation workforce\u201d) were more likely to be used in Republican speeches.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on education One-, two- and three-word phrases about education that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nchild care 0.02 39.1% 7.4% D+31.7 education need 0.00 30.4 0.0 D+30.4 kindergarten 0.07 47.8 18.5 D+29.3 early childhood 0.06 43.5 14.8 D+28.7 educational 0.12 21.7 48.2 R+26.4 students state 0.01 26.1 0.0 D+26.1 scholarships 0.10 13.0 37.0 R+24.0 graduate 0.22 56.5 33.3 D+23.2 learning 0.27 43.5 66.7 R+23.2 educators deserve 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 foster care 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 quality education 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 school district 0.10 8.7 29.6 R+20.9 graduates 0.19 17.4 37.0 R+19.7 teacher pay 0.19 17.4 37.0 R+19.7 early childhood education 0.13 30.4 11.1 D+19.3 graduation 0.24 21.7 40.7 R+19.0 education workforce 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 college tuition 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 schools year 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 special education 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 tuition 0.29 43.5 25.9 D+17.6 scholarship 0.27 17.4 33.3 R+15.9 teacher 0.51 52.2 66.7 R+14.5 best brightest 0.15 4.4 18.5 R+14.2 year degree 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 training programs 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 children future 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 community college 0.40 34.8 22.2 D+12.6 teachers 0.62 82.6 70.4 D+12.2 classroom 0.55 52.2 40.7 D+11.4 school districts 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 universities 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 school students 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 graduate high school 0.35 21.7 11.1 D+10.6 young children 0.35 21.7 11.1 D+10.6 bachelor degree 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 children foster care 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 school student 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 school boards 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 parents teachers 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 teacher pay raise 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 high school college 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 public schools 0.56 43.5 33.3 D+10.2 class education 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 world class education 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 dedicated teachers 0.31 17.4 7.4 D+10.0 high schools 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 teacher salaries 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 computer science 0.52 17.4 25.9 R+8.5 high school 0.74 69.6 77.8 R+8.2 superintendent 0.59 21.7 29.6 R+7.9 students 0.79 100.0 92.6 D+7.4 educators 0.72 43.5 37.0 D+6.4 university 0.77 56.5 63.0 R+6.4 early education 0.55 17.4 11.1 D+6.3 help students 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 colleges 0.73 39.1 33.3 D+5.8 day kindergarten 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 education opportunity 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 school buildings 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 funding education 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 state college 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 technical education 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 students parents 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 student debt 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 post secondary 0.63 13.0 18.5 R+5.5 middle school 0.63 13.0 18.5 R+5.5 local school 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 stem 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 math 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 public school 0.76 21.7 25.9 R+4.2 higher education 0.84 47.8 51.9 R+4.0 college 0.88 73.9 77.8 R+3.9 education funding 0.78 26.1 22.2 D+3.9 apprenticeship 0.80 21.7 18.5 D+3.2 schools 0.91 95.7 92.6 D+3.1 apprenticeship programs 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 college degree 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 education budget 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 education programs 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 good education 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 graduation rate 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 12 schools 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 local school districts 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 students like 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 students graduate 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 elementary school 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 colleges universities 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 schools need 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 classrooms 0.93 39.1 40.7 R+1.6 schools state 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 teaching 0.96 30.4 29.6 D+0.8 public education 0.96 30.4 29.6 D+0.8 12 education 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 elementary 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 community colleges 0.97 21.7 22.2 R+0.5 high school students 0.99 26.1 25.9 D+0.2 education 1.00 100.0 100.0 EVEN school 1.00 100.0 100.0 EVEN Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

But on the state level, those ideas came up in only a handful of gubernatorial speeches \u2014 mostly Democratic ones. Democratic governors were more loquacious about another progressive priority, \u201cearly childhood education,\u201d which was mentioned by seven Democratic governors and three Republican ones.\n\nHealth care\n\nAnother issue governors talked a lot about was health care \u2014 especially Democratic governors. That makes sense considering that health care was the No. 1 issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections, which is when many of those Democratic governors were elected.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on health care One-, two- and three-word phrases about health care that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nsick 0.01 39.1% 3.7% D+35.4 affordable care act 0.01 39.1 3.7 D+35.4 health care 0.25 100.0 70.4 D+29.6 healthy 0.15 60.9 33.3 D+27.5 expand medicaid 0.02 30.4 3.7 D+26.7 access health 0.06 30.4 7.4 D+23.0 reproductive health 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 pre existing conditions 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 cost health 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 existing conditions 0.02 21.7 0.0 D+21.7 hospital 0.19 43.5 22.2 D+21.3 medical 0.32 65.2 44.4 D+20.8 epidemic 0.17 39.1 18.5 D+20.6 dr 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 access health care 0.10 26.1 7.4 D+18.7 health outcomes 0.07 21.7 3.7 D+18.0 health insurance 0.29 43.5 25.9 D+17.6 hospitals 0.26 34.8 18.5 D+16.3 doctor 0.24 30.4 14.8 D+15.6 health care costs 0.21 26.1 11.1 D+15.0 affordable health care 0.18 21.7 7.4 D+14.3 expanded medicaid 0.13 17.4 3.7 D+13.7 healthier 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 public health 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 behavioral health 0.37 26.1 14.8 D+11.3 health services 0.57 30.4 22.2 D+8.2 health 0.79 100.0 92.6 D+7.4 medicaid 0.74 52.2 59.3 R+7.1 quality health care 0.55 17.4 11.1 D+6.3 medicaid program 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 children health 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 health crisis 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 health challenges 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 illness 0.80 21.7 18.5 D+3.2 health substance 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 medicaid expansion 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

A lower p-value means that the partisanship of a phrase in our data set is more statistically distinguishable. Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nDemocratic governors were more likely than Republican ones to utter almost every health care-related phrase we looked at. For instance, more Democratic governors (nine of them, or 39 percent) used the phrase \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d (the health care law passed under former President Barack Obama) than Republican governors (one, or 4 percent). And four Democratic governors called for their states to \u201cexpand Medicaid\u201d \u2014 all of them, perhaps unsurprisingly, in states with divided government (where the governor, state Senate and/or state House are controlled by different parties). This could be because Medicaid expansion has recently passed in several red states and is broadly popular, making it a fertile issue for bipartisan cooperation. Or it could be simply because every Democratic-controlled state has expanded Medicaid already.\n\nMostly missing, however, from all the health care talk was an endorsement of a single-payer health-insurance system \u2014 a major policy priority of some Democratic presidential candidates. Democrat Gavin Newsom of California was the only governor to mention \u201csingle payer\u201d health care, or the idea that the government should pay for everyone\u2019s health care with private insurance plans effectively eliminated, but he mentioned it only as a \u201clong-term goal.\u201d Likewise, only Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington urged his legislature to create a \u201cpublic health option,\u201d which would give people the ability to buy into a government-administered insurance plan. (His state went on this year to pass legislation that created this option.)\n\nThe economy\n\nThe third nearly ubiquitous issue in state of the state addresses was the economy. While rhetoric about jobs was bipartisan (\u201cjob\u201d or \u201cjobs\u201d appeared in every speech), Republican and Democratic governors approached other aspects of economic policy differently.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on the economy One-, two- and three-word phrases about the economy that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how

Interestingly, eight of the nine were speaking to a friendly (i.e., Democratic) legislature, indicating how raising the minimum wage is a priority for Democratic-controlled states.\n\nEnergy and the environment\n\nWe found differences among Republican and Democratic speeches on other policy issues as well.

There was a similar partisan split (11 to one) in calls for \u201cclean energy.\u201d By contrast, Republicans tended to framed their environmental goals around protecting \u201cnatural resources\u201d (a phrase that appeared in eight GOP speeches and three Democratic ones).\n\nCriminal justice\n\nCriminal-justice reform seems to be one of the few remaining bipartisan issues these days, and, fittingly, the term \u201ccriminal justice\u201d appeared in 13 Republican speeches and in 12 Democratic ones.\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on criminal justice One-, two- and three-word phrases about criminal justice that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nprison 0.01 21.7% 74.1% R+52.3 enforcement 0.03 21.7 63.0 R+41.2 law enforcement 0.03 21.7 63.0 R+41.2 gun violence 0.00 34.8 0.0 D+34.8 public safety 0.10 30.4 63.0 R+32.5 corrections 0.04 8.7 37.0 R+28.3 violence 0.13 52.2 25.9 D+26.2 gun safety 0.01 26.1 0.0 D+26.1 prisons 0.10 13.0 37.0 R+24.0 school safety 0.06 4.4 25.9 R+21.6 correctional 0.14 13.0 33.3 R+20.3 gun 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 attorney general 0.15 34.8 14.8 D+20.0 local law enforcement 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 schools safer 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 prison population 0.04 0.0 18.5 R+18.5 crime 0.28 26.1 44.4 R+18.4 violent 0.32 21.7 37.0 R+15.3 offenders 0.38 17.4 29.6 R+12.2 criminal 0.62 52.2 63.0 R+10.8 violent crime 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 non violent 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 police officer 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 law enforcement officers 0.45 13.0 22.2 R+9.2 police officers 0.53 13.0 7.4 D+5.6 criminal justice reform 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 victims 0.76 21.7 25.9 R+4.2 criminal justice 0.84 52.2 48.2 D+4.0 state police 0.82 17.4 14.8 D+2.6 violent offenders 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 recidivism rate 0.79 8.7 11.1 R+2.4 police 0.96 43.5 44.4 R+1.0 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nBut Republican governors also lived up to their party\u2019s historical \u201ctough on crime\u201d reputation, at least through their rhetoric. For instance, they were far more likely to nod to \u201cpublic safety,\u201d a phrase used by 17 GOP governors but seven Democrats. And while 17 Republicans mentioned \u201claw enforcement\u201d in their state of the state addresses, only five Democrats did. Republicans also talked more about \u201cprisons\u201d and \u201ccorrections\u201d than Democrats did \u2014 however, their language surrounding it wasn\u2019t always \u201ctough.\u201d For example, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds touted her state\u2019s apprenticeship programs that try to reintegrate inmates in society: \u201cMost of our inmates aren\u2019t inmates for life. They will reenter society \u2014 and when they do, we want them to be successful. Those who can\u2019t get a job often find their way back to crime and then back to prison.\u201d Several other Republican governors discussed the need to reduce their \u201cprison population.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, it was mostly Democratic governors who talked about guns. For example, eight Democratic governors used the term \u201cgun violence,\u201d but no Republicans did so. Notably, only two Republican governors even mentioned the \u201cSecond Amendment.\u201d More frequently, Republicans talked about guns in the context of \u201cschool safety,\u201d a phrase used in seven GOP speeches and one Democratic one.\n\nMental health\n\nMore Republican governors (18) than Democratic ones (10) used the phrase \u201cmental health\u201d in their state of the state addresses, and a third of those Republicans \u2014 six of the 18 \u2014 did so in the context of violence in schools. For example, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said, \u201cTo keep our classrooms safe, we must also address the mental health issues that often lead to school violence.\u201d\n\nThe partisan (and not so partisan) rhetoric on mental health One-, two- and three-word phrases about mental health that appeared in governors\u2019 2019 state of the state speeches, by how often a phrase was used by Democratic and Republican governors SHARE THAT INCLUDE PHRASE Phrase \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nP-VALUE* \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDem. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nRep. speeches \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nDiff \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nmental health 0.27 43.5% 66.7% R+23.2 drugs 0.24 21.7 40.7 R+19.0 drug 0.44 43.5 59.3 R+15.8 addiction 0.50 26.1 37.0 R+11.0 mental health issues 0.24 4.4 14.8 R+10.5 opioid addiction 0.35 8.7 18.5 R+9.8 overdose 0.57 26.1 18.5 D+7.6 opioid 0.71 47.8 40.7 D+7.1 substance 0.69 30.4 37.0 R+6.6 mental health care 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 substance use 0.53 8.7 14.8 R+6.1 opioid crisis 0.70 17.4 22.2 R+4.8 substance abuse 0.78 26.1 22.2 D+3.9 mental health substance 0.84 13.0 11.1 D+1.9 mental health services 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 mental illness 0.93 17.4 18.5 R+1.1 Excludes two- and three-word phrases that appeared in fewer than five speeches and single words that appeared in fewer than 10 speeches.

A lower p-value means that the partisanship of a phrase in our data set is more statistically distinguishable. Sources: State websites, media outlets\n\nOther Republicans spoke about mental health more broadly. For instance, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu discussed overhauling the state\u2019s mental health care system and reducing suicide rates. And four Republican governors brought up mental health in the context of drug addiction. Republicans were also likelier than Democrats to discuss \u201copioid addiction,\u201d but \u201copioid\u201d overall was relatively common in both Democratic and Republican speeches.\n\nAs for immigration and abortion, two issues that have recently been prominent on the national level, we didn\u2019t find a lot of discussion of them in the governors\u2019 speeches. Only three gubernatorial speeches included the word \u201cimmigration,\u201d and related terms were similarly rare. When they did come up, there was a noticeable partisan divide: For example, Democrats were more likely to use the word \u201cimmigrants\u201d (four speeches to two), while Republicans were more likely to reference the \u201cborder\u201d (five speeches to one). Similarly, just two governors mentioned abortion: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, who is a supporter of abortion rights, and Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, who is against abortion. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that state governments aren\u2019t legislating on abortion \u2014 we know that they are \u2014 but it\u2019s notable that so few governors mentioned it in their speeches.\n\nSetting partisan differences aside, a lot of governors agreed on one thing in particular: that the state of their state was strong! Of the dozens of governors who included the phrase \u201cthe state of our state is \u2026\u201d in their state of the state address, at least 16 followed it with \u201cstrong\u201d or some variation thereof \u2014 including \u201cstronger than ever,\u201d \u201cgrowing stronger each day\u201d and \u201chopeful, prosperous and strong.\u201d Others were more creative and said the state of their state was \u201csolid,\u201d \u201crock solid,\u201d \u201cfull of opportunity\u201d or \u201cdetermined.\u201d But a few were \u2026 less confident: \u201cThe state of our state is improving\u201d (ouch, Kansas); \u201cthe state of our state is that we\u2019ve got work to do\u201d (better get cracking, Wisconsin!).\n\nLaura Bronner contributed analysis.", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americas-governors-are-talking-about/", "author": ["Nathaniel Rakich", "Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"title": "Which 2020 Candidates Have The Most In Common \u2026 On Twitter?", "text": "The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates use Twitter like an earlier generation of politicians may have used a soapbox: to announce policy plans, solicit donations, marshal their supporters and criticize the current administration.\n\nEach of these candidates is speaking to his or her own virtual village square. But how many people spend time in more than one village? How much overlap is there between, say, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s audience and Bernie Sanders\u2019s? And which candidates are most often associated with one another, based on their Twitter followers?\n\nTwitter isn\u2019t real life, of course; it\u2019s an often-ridiculous short-burst social network that is decidedly not representative of the electorate at large. But it\u2019s still a slice of life. The people following candidates on Twitter are those who want to receive a steady stream of information about at least part of the 2020 campaign. Understanding how that tribe operates can tell us something about an influential slice of the electorate.\n\nSo off our web-scraper went, dredging up every follower of the 20 Democratic presidential candidates who FiveThirtyEight considered \u201cmajor\u201d in early May, when we ran our script. The result was a data set with almost 20 million entries, which you can download on GitHub.\n\nThis data reveals the obvious, such as raw follower counts. It also reveals more subtle trends, such as which candidates\u2019 followers are loyal, which cast a broad net, which seem to have a similar appeal and which apparently have nothing in common.\n\nFor starters, here are the candidates ranked by the share of their followers who don\u2019t follow any other 2020 Democratic candidate.\n\nCandidates whose followers are loyal only to them Share of each 2020 candidate\u2019s followers who don\u2019t follow any other candidates Account \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nFOLLOWERS \u25b2 \u25bc\n\nExclusive FOLLOWERS \u25b2 \u25bc\n\n@marwilliamson 2,610,335 \u2013 74.8% \u2013 \u2013 @BernieSanders 9,254,423 \u2013 63.2 \u2013 \u2013 @Hickenlooper 144,816 \u2013 56.3 \u2013 \u2013 @CoryBooker 4,246,252 \u2013 52.5 \u2013 \u2013 @JoeBiden 3,558,333 \u2013 43.8 \u2013 \u2013 @AndrewYang 267,897 \u2013 43.4 \u2013 \u2013 @TulsiGabbard 349,443 \u2013 34.7 \u2013 \u2013 @BetoORourke 1,424,745 \u2013 26.5 \u2013 \u2013 @amyklobuchar 692,985 \u2013 24.0 \u2013 \u2013 @PeteButtigieg 1,033,834 \u2013 23.7 \u2013 \u2013 @SenGillibrand 1,410,303 \u2013 23.3 \u2013 \u2013 @KamalaHarris 2,640,072 \u2013 22.3 \u2013 \u2013 @JulianCastro 212,582 \u2013 21.4 \u2013 \u2013 @sethmoulton 138,450 \u2013 20.1 \u2013 \u2013 @JayInslee 51,504 \u2013 19.0 \u2013 \u2013 @ewarren 2,486,101 \u2013 16.4 \u2013 \u2013 @TimRyan 20,080 \u2013 15.6 \u2013 \u2013 @JohnDelaney 20,266 \u2013 12.9 \u2013 \u2013 @MichaelBennet 21,053 \u2013 11.7 \u2013 \u2013 @ericswalwell 84,415 \u2013 9.2 \u2013 \u2013 Among candidates who were considered \u201cmajor\u201d by FiveThirtyEight as of May 8. Follower lists for each candidate\u2019s primary accounts (according to a CSPAN Twitter list) were scraped from May 8-15, except for @Hickenlooper, which was scraped on June 6 to correct a coding error.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of the people who follow Marianne Williamson \u2014 a \u201cspiritual and inspirational author, lecturer, non-profit activist,\u201d per her Twitter bio \u2014 don\u2019t follow any other Democratic candidate, putting them in a loyalty class all their own. Similarly, of the over 9 million people who follow Bernie Sanders, almost two-thirds follow no other candidate.\n\nThe 2.5 million people who follow Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, are more gregarious \u2014 84 percent of them follow at least one of her Democratic rivals. Ditto the 2.6 million people who follow Kamala Harris, 78 percent of whom also follow another candidate.\n\nDigging a little deeper into the follower interaction information, we can find out, for example, which other candidates Warren\u2019s followers are paying attention to. The Venn diagrams below try to answer that question, showing the overlap in followers between every candidate who had more than 500,000 followers in early May.\n\nThis chart reveals relatively large intersections between followers of Sanders and Warren, who share progressive policy platforms; between followers of Pete Buttigieg and Beto O\u2019Rourke, who are both young, male and white; and between Harris and other major female candidates such as Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar.\n\nFollower overlap patterns seem to share some similarities with Democrats\u2019 vote preferences, too. Morning Consult has been tracking voters\u2019 second-choice candidates, and according to the latest poll, respondents who planned to vote for Warren said their top backup choices were Harris and Sanders. Similarly, on Twitter, 60 percent of Warren\u2019s followers also follow Sanders, and 37 percent each follow Harris and Biden \u2014 her largest overlap groups.\n\nWith some simple calculations, we can look past the sheer size of each Twitter overlap and get a sense for which pairs of candidates share some quality (ideology, Twitter skills, who knows) that makes them appeal to the same people. Theoretically, people could be following multiple presidential candidates at random, but that\u2019s not how Twitter really works \u2014 if one account speaks to my interests, I\u2019m likely to be interested in similar accounts.\n\nTo figure out which candidates are getting paired up more often than we\u2019d expect based on chance alone, we rely on a number that data miners call \u201clift,\u201d which is the ratio of how many followers a pair actually has to how many followers we\u2019d expect them to have based solely on their individual Twitter popularity. For example, say we have 100 total Twitter users, and 50 of them follow Sanders while 10 of them follow Warren. If the reasons that a person followed Sanders had nothing to do with the reasons they followed Warren, we\u2019d expect the overlap between the two to be five users. If it turns out that 10 users follow both Warren and Sanders, then we have a lift value of two (twice as many as expected), which means we can speculate that the two candidates share some quality that appeals to the same people. If only one user follows both, then we have a lift of 0.2 (one-fifth as many as expected), and we would suspect that there\u2019s something about each candidate that drives away some people who follow the other candidate.\n\nIn the chart below, candidate pairs are organized by lift value, so those above the dotted line have more followers in common than you\u2019d expect by chance while those below the line have fewer.\n\nSome of the pairs that float above the line on this chart also stood out in the Venn diagrams, such as Harris and Warren, Harris and Gillibrand and O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg. O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro also have a relatively large overlap, perhaps because they\u2019re both from Texas. The small dots at the very top capture overlaps that are tens of times larger than we\u2019d expect to see if the candidates\u2019 appeals to followers were unrelated. That\u2019s probably because users who follow one lesser-known candidate such as Michael Bennet or John Delaney are likely to be highly engaged in the race and follow the other candidates as well. For example, the average Delaney follower also follows more than six other Democratic candidates.\n\nThe chart also reveals the candidate pairs who are not followed together. Williamson appears in most of these pairs, but the combination of Sanders and Booker also sinks to the bottom; their follower overlap is about half the size of what we\u2019d expect given their individual popularity.\n\nTwitter is just one front on which the fight for the Democratic nomination is being waged, but it does provide some insight into how candidates are using social media and who is listening. Democrats are, after all, looking for a candidate who can beat President Trump, who redefined how we view Silicon Valley\u2019s little blue bird.\n\nWe want to hear how you\u2019re using this data!

Questions, comments or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nA separation-of-powers showdown has been brewing since Democrats took control of the House in January. And with two new lawsuits directly attacking House Democrats\u2019 oversight authority, President Trump is now challenging whether one of Congress\u2019s most potent checks on the executive branch can be used to probe his finances.\n\nOver the past month, several House committees have issued subpoenas to banks with ties to Trump and an accounting firm that prepared several years of his financial statements, demanding a variety of documents. Trump has already declared that the White House won\u2019t cooperate with any of the Democrats\u2019 investigations, but he has little control over whether an external organization like a bank complies with a congressional subpoena. So he sued the banks, the accounting firm and House oversight committee Chairman Elijah Cummings. Trump is asking the courts to invalidate the subpoenas and arguing that they are an illegitimate exercise of Congress\u2019s oversight power.\n\nIt\u2019s a bold \u2014 and possibly even unprecedented \u2014 argument. Several legal experts told me that this appears to be the first time a sitting president has responded to a congressional inquiry by suing a member of Congress. They predicted that the cases will likely be difficult to win in court. Instead, they said, the lawsuits\u2019 real power lies in politics and delay: They help Trump feed a political argument that House Democrats are unfairly persecuting him, while the subpoenas could be tied up in the courts for months or even years. And the ripple effects could be much bigger \u2014 if Trump successfully evades congressional scrutiny in these cases and others, future presidents could be emboldened to challenge Congress in similar ways.\n\nDemocrats are arguing that the contested subpoenas to Deutsche Bank, Capital One and Mazars USA, the accounting firm, fall squarely under their oversight powers. Congress can conduct investigations related to legislation and the functioning of the executive branch, and Democrats say they\u2019re trying to learn whether Trump or his businesses are dependent on Russian money in a way that could influence his presidential decision-making. They\u2019ve also said the banking subpoenas are part of a broader effort to determine whether the banks are helping Russian clients get money out of Russia. This wider investigation could theoretically trigger further congressional action if it reveals that the banks were involved in illicit money laundering.\n\nBut Trump is arguing that Democrats are seeking details of his private financial dealings merely to score political points and that the subpoenas to the banks violate privacy laws. In the lawsuit against Cummings and the accounting firm, Trump\u2019s lawyers say that Democrats have \u201cdeclared all-out political war\u201d against the president, with subpoenas as \u201ctheir weapons of choice,\u201d and are trying \u201cto expose [Trump\u2019s] private financial information for the sake of exposure.\u201d And in the lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One, they write that the subpoenas are intended to \u201charass\u201d Trump and \u201cferret about for any material that might be used to cause him political damage.\u201d\n\nThese claims of overreach might play well with Trump\u2019s base, but the case itself is a long shot, said Cornell University law professor Josh Chafetz, who studies the relationship between Congress and the executive branch. \u201cCongress has incredibly broad oversight powers, and there are any number of areas where these records could be relevant,\u201d he said.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a completely open-and-shut case, however. Lance Cole, a law professor at Penn State University and an expert on congressional investigations, said that because courts have ruled in the past that Congress can\u2019t use its power to peer into citizens\u2019 private lives without some legitimate justification, a judge might be sympathetic to Trump\u2019s argument, particularly if Democrats are asking for lots of old financial documents. However, in the 1990s, Congress probed the details of a 15-year-old real estate deal involving Bill and Hillary Clinton as part of the Whitewater investigation, dredging up personal details from long before Clinton was president. That may bolster the argument that a president can\u2019t really be compared with an ordinary citizen. \u201cYou can debate the merits of the investigation, but it\u2019s hard for Trump to say that Congress has never done this before,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t need to prevail in these cases to deal the Democrats a significant setback, however \u2014 he just needs to ensure that the lawsuits are not immediately dismissed. That\u2019s because it can take months for a case to wend its way through the judicial bureaucracy before it goes to trial, and the subpoenas will likely be put on hold until the case is resolved. \u201cIt\u2019s completely possible we won\u2019t have an answer until after the 2020 election,\u201d said Margaret Taylor, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nSo the lawsuits are likely to help Trump whether or not he ultimately wins them. In the short term, they\u2019re feeding a broader political narrative of Democratic overreach. In the medium term \u2014 possibly through the entire election cycle \u2014 they will delay Democrats\u2019 efforts to access his financial records. The million-dollar question is what the impact will be on our political system in the long term. Taylor told me that it\u2019s deeply unusual for a president to argue that he\u2019s simply not subject to congressional oversight. \u201cSince Watergate, presidents have had their disagreements with Congress, but they have recognized that Congress has a valid oversight role,\u201d she said.\n\nRegardless of what happens with Trump\u2019s finances, this fight could be a sign of things to come. \u201cIf Trump continues to stonewall and the Democrats don\u2019t push back or their pushback is ineffective, future presidents will decide that they basically aren\u2019t answerable to Congress unless they want to be,\u201d Chafetz said.\n\nOther cases\n\nPresident Trump\n\nA case alleging that Trump is unconstitutionally accepting \u201cemoluments\u201d from foreign countries will be allowed to move forward. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that congressional Democrats\u2019 definition of emolument \u2014 which broadly encompasses any gift or payment from a foreign power \u2014 is more convincing than Trump\u2019s attorneys\u2019 narrower definition of an emolument as a payment received for services performed in the president\u2019s official capacity. Another emoluments case filed by the attorneys general of D.C. and Maryland is currently pending in an appeals court, but the scope of the Democrats\u2019 lawsuit is much broader \u2014 rather than focusing on Trump\u2019s Washington, D.C., hotel, it implicates all of Trump\u2019s businesses worldwide.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nOne of the cases challenging Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs, who said they were withdrawing from the suit because the money obtained through the declaration wouldn\u2019t be used to build barriers in the places where their clients are located. Many other lawsuits involving the national emergency declaration are ongoing.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments in April on a case about whether the Trump administration can add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. Many observers reported that the court\u2019s conservative majority seemed willing to allow the addition of the question.\n\nThe Department of Justice filed a brief in a case involving the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, arguing that the entire law is unconstitutional, which is a reversal of its previous position that some, but not all, of the ACA should be struck down. A federal district court judge in Texas ruled in December that the ACA is unconstitutional because a 2017 law removed the tax penalty for not having health insurance. The case is now pending appeal.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland denied the Trump administration\u2019s request to dismiss a new set of lawsuits against the travel ban to the U.S. by residents of seven countries, including several where most of the citizens are Muslim. The Supreme Court allowed the policy to take effect last summer, but the new travel ban lawsuits are challenging the legality of its design and enforcement. The judge\u2019s ruling will allow the plaintiffs to obtain evidence about how the process of administering the ban is unfolding.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration pushes back against Democrats", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/will-trumps-latest-lawsuits-keep-congress-from-investigating-future-presidents/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"title": "Trump Is Losing The Legal Fight Against Sanctuary Cities, But It May Still Pay Off Politically", "text": "This is the Trump Docket, where we track some of the most important legal cases of the Trump presidency and how their results could shape presidential power. Questions, comments, or thoughts about cases to cover? Email us here.\n\nOn Friday, a federal appeals court handed down another setback for President Trump\u2019s effort to crack down on sanctuary cities, a campaign pledge that he has been fighting to fulfill since his first few days in office. The judges in the case ruled that the Trump administration could not withhold federal law-enforcement funds from cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents. The ruling came down on the same day that Trump declared a national emergency to secure funding to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 another effort to fulfill a key campaign promise, and one that will almost certainly be mired in a lengthy legal process where a win is far from guaranteed.\n\nWhy is the president so willing to dig in and risk legal defeat when it comes to his signature immigration issues? It might be because without cooperation from Congress, Trump\u2019s best shot at fulfilling some of his key campaign promises is to take bold \u2014 and possibly unconstitutional \u2014 actions and hope for a victory in the courts. Even a series of losses might seem better, from a political perspective, than doing nothing. As Christopher Lasch, a law professor at the University of Denver, told me, \u201cTo the extent that he can tell his base he\u2019s trying to do something, that\u2019s a win for Trump \u2014 regardless of how the cases turn out.\u201d In the case of sanctuary cities, what\u2019s at stake is the balance of power between the federal government and state and local authorities \u2014 and so far, judges have almost uniformly sided against the federal government.\n\nFrom the beginning, Trump and his administration have been fighting an uphill battle against sanctuary cities. Judges across the country \u2014 appointed by both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 have rejected several attempts by the administration to yank federal funding from cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration-enforcement efforts, and a federal judge in California refused the administration\u2019s request to suspend the state\u2019s sanctuary laws. \u201cThey\u2019ve been roundly defeated again and again,\u201d said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University.\n\nMany of these cases revolve around a federal law that says cities and states can\u2019t forbid their employees from communicating with federal agents about the immigration status of people in their jurisdiction. An executive order issued by Trump in his first few days in office and the conditions later placed by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions on law-enforcement grants both make federal funding at least partially contingent on compliance with federal agents. But legal experts told me that it\u2019s unconstitutional for a president to try to attach these kinds of strings to funding, because Congress controls spending and therefore only Congress has the power to impose conditions on federal grants. The law itself may also be unconstitutional under the 10th Amendment, which shields states\u2019 rights. Several judges have made this point in their rulings, relying on a 2018 Supreme Court decision that was authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito and overturned a federal sports gambling law on the grounds that it was \u201ccommandeering\u201d the states to enforce federal laws.\n\nThese recent lower-court rulings may have been predictable \u2014 at least to legal experts. But the Trump administration pressed on anyway, perhaps because the success of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda partially depends on his ability to get local law enforcement to work with federal agents. It\u2019s hard for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to locate undocumented immigrants without the help of state or local police.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more cost effective and efficient for ICE to pick people up who\u2019ve already been arrested and held in the local jail than to go find them in their home or elsewhere,\u201d said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. According to a 2018 report from his organization, 69 percent of ICE arrests during the first 135 days of the Trump administration were based on transfers from the criminal-justice system. The institute also found that California\u2019s share of overall ICE arrests fell after statewide sanctuary policies were implemented, while the share of arrests rose in some other parts of the country.\n\nGiven this context, it makes sense that the Trump administration would continue to fight sanctuary cities, despite the administration\u2019s string of defeats so far. And Trump may be banking on a more favorable hearing at the Supreme Court, which ultimately upheld his ban on travel to the U.S. from a number of countries, including several where the majority of the population is Muslim, after a series of losses in the lower courts. Most of the legal experts I spoke with were skeptical, though, that the justices would be willing to take the cases involving conditions on federal grants unless the administration wins in at least one appellate court.\n\nBut if the goal is to demonstrate to Trump\u2019s base that he\u2019s working to fulfill a key campaign promise, his record in the courts may not really matter. Jessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which seeks to decrease immigration to the U.S., said that Trump faces significant pressure from his base to do something \u2014 anything \u2014 to fight back against sanctuary cities, which is why it could be more politically costly to back down than to continue losing. \u201cThe people who support increased immigration enforcement are very frustrated with this status quo, and they want to see the Trump administration take it as far as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd the president may simply feel that he doesn\u2019t have much to lose by continuing to fight. Taking a few more defeats on sanctuary cities won\u2019t change much right away, since the administration is already losing across the board. It\u2019s possible that if California\u2019s sanctuary law is ultimately upheld, more states will decide to pass similar legislation, but that process would take time. And by tying state and local governments up in expensive legal battles, the administration could end up deterring some smaller or less firmly Democratic cities from enacting sanctuary policies, Lasch said.\n\n\u201cEven if he keeps losing, that reinforces the narrative that the Trump administration is trying to enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws and the courts are against them,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro, director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute. Trump could be making a similar calculation about declaring a national emergency: Settling in for a series of defeats in the short term could turn out to be a successful political strategy in the long run.\n\nOther cases\n\nPre-presidency Trump\n\nA federal judge ruled that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort intentionally lied to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, in violation of his plea agreement. As a result, Manafort\u2019s plea deal is no longer in effect, which means he could spend the rest of his life in prison.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Roger Stone is now under a limited gag order issued by the same judge after Stone went on a media blitz last month discussing his indictment and arrest as part of Mueller\u2019s investigation. Then Stone posted a picture to Instagram that included a picture of the judge\u2019s face with crosshairs in the background, prompting the judge to schedule a hearing for Thursday to discuss the conditions of his release. Stone apologized to the judge and took the image down, but she indicated that his release on bail could now be in jeopardy.\n\nPresident Trump\n\nLast spring, a judge ruled that Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked people from viewing or replying to his posts on Twitter. Trump appealed the case to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where oral arguments were recently scheduled for March 26.\n\nThe Trump administration\n\nOn Friday, another case involving Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2014 which removes the threat of deportation from certain undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children \u2014 will be argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Last spring in the same case, a federal District Court judge ruled that Trump\u2019s reasons for revoking the program were \u201cvirtually unexplained\u201d and the revocation was therefore illegal.\n\nWilliam Barr was confirmed as attorney general on Thursday, triggering the dismissal of several challenges to acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker\u2019s appointment last November.\n\nLast Friday, Trump declared the situation on the country\u2019s southern border to be a national emergency in order to secure funds to build a long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico. On Monday, the attorneys general of 16 states sued the president, arguing that his declaration violates the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. Another lawsuit has been filed against the president by an environmental organization and several landowners in south Texas who say they\u2019ll be affected by the construction of the wall, in addition to a separate lawsuit filed by several environmental and animal rights groups. A watchdog group is also suing the Department of Justice for failing to provide records related to the president\u2019s legal authority to invoke a national emergency. All of these cases have been added to the latest update of the Trump Docket data set.\n\nFrom ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s national emergency faces legal pushback", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-is-losing-the-legal-fight-against-sanctuary-cities-but-it-may-still-pay-off-politically/", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}]}, "theguardian": {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/international", "articles": [{"title": "Introducing the new Guardian app for Android and iOS", "text": "As it happens not after it happened\n\nGet the latest news in real time.

The central and local governments do not have the legal power to enforce business closures or limit their opening hours, and have relied on bars, restaurants, clubs and other establishments to take action voluntarily.\n\nFriday\u2019s record number of new infections comes a day after Tokyo announced 367 new cases \u2013 another record. Infections have been rising in several parts of Japan since a nationwide state of emergency was lifted at the end of May, with a large number of cases traced to the city\u2019s nightlife districts.\n\nPeople in their 20s and 30s account for about 60% of infections, but the proportion of people aged 40 or older is increasing, the Nikkei said. Officials have noted that Tokyo health authorities are testing more people per day than during the earlier stages of the pandemic.\n\nThe number of infections in Tokyo now exceeds 12,000, more than half of which were reported this month.

Of the local transmissions, 112 were in Xinjiang and 11 in the province of Liaoning. Separately, authorities also reported 11 new asymptomatic cases.\n\nThis week has seen China\u2019s largest daily rises in cases since the peak, with 105 reported on Wednesday, 101 on Tuesday, and 68 on Monday.\n\nGlobal coronavirus cases stand at 17,219,767, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker, with nearly 672,00 deaths.\n\nIn Xinjiang, strict anti-virus measures have been in place in the capital Urumqi for over a week, including the suspension of most public transport and flights, and controls on the entry and exit of people at housing compounds in some districts.\n\nHowever, experts have sounded the alarm over the risk to people detained in China\u2019s secretive internment camps. Clusters of infections have been recorded in Urumqi, and the city of Kashgar about 300km away, suggesting infections could be widespread in between. There are fears the virus could be brought into the camps by employees, or brought into the homes of Uighur and other Turkic minority families by Han Chinese who move into their house under a compulsory homestay program.\n\nThe Liaoning outbreak in the country\u2019s east, is centred on the city of Dalian, but has spread to other cities and provinces in recent days. State media reported more than 17,500 medics had been mobilised to run almost 2,700 testing sites across the city. By midnight on Tuesday about 3.53m samples had been collected, CCTV reported.\n\nSince bringing the virus largely under control after the outbreak began in Wuhan more than seven months ago, China continues to see frequent outbreaks in large cities, including in Beijing, and a second spike in Wuhan. Authorities have responded quickly with varying degrees of lockdown measures, and large-scale testing, which the state mouthpiece China Daily described as now being a \u201cdefault response to new clusters of Covid-19\u201d.\n\nIt said more than 2.3m tests were conducted in Urumqi in the first 10 days of the outbreak, and more than 1.2m on the first day of Dalian\u2019s outbreak. In Urumqi 13 to 38 asymptomatic carriers a day were identified, China Daily said. A National Health Commission spokesman claimed China had the capability to test 3.78 million people a day, and had doubled the number of testing facilities between early March and late June.\n\nIn south-east Asia, the UN has said decades of progress in tackling poverty could be undone by the economic impact of coronavirus.\n\nWhile many countries in the region have managed to control the pandemic, it has disrupted trade, and brought travel to a standstill in tourism-dependent countries such as Thailand. Migrant workers who send remittances back home to their families, a major source of income in countries such as the Philippines, have been left stranded and without employment.\n\nThe UN warned of rising unemployment in countries such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, adding that: \u201c[A] lack of secured income and sufficient social protection could force tens of millions of people into extreme poverty in this region,\u201d it said.\n\nIt also raised alarm over the situation facing the region\u2019s 218 million informal workers, who have not only lost their livelihoods but also face rising xenophobia in some countries.\n\nThe policy brief, released on Thursday, urged governments to fix long-standing problems such tax evasion, transfer pricing, and subsidies supporting fossil fuels, and called for higher health spending.\n\nAcross the region, it is estimated that GDP will contract on average by 0.1% in 2020, compared with a pre-Covid-19 forecast of 4.5% growth. Remittances from workers across east Asia and the Pacific are expected to fall by 13% or $10bn.\n\nVietnam has reported 45 new coronavirus infections in the city of Danang, marking the country\u2019s biggest single-day jump in cases, as the health ministry sent more health experts to the central city in a bid to combat the outbreak.\n\nIn Indonesia, the governor of the capital, Jakarta, Anies Baswedan, extended social restrictions on Thursday to curb coronavirus transmission, warning of \u201ca hike in cases\u201d. Schools will remain closed and restaurants and public transportation will continue to operate at limited capacity until 13 August.\n\n\u201cThere has not been any improvement from two weeks ago to right now,\u201d he said, adding that there had been clusters found in offices in the capital.\n\nIndonesia has reported a total of 106,336 coronavirus cases, the biggest in east Asia, though it is feared by some health experts that this is an underestimate.\n\nThe Philippines, which is also among the hardest hit in the region, announced on Friday that it would maintain coronavirus restrictions in the capital Manila until mid-August, following a rise in cases. This includes restrictions on movement for elderly and children, and limits on the capacity of businesses.\n\nPresidential spokesperson Harry Roque this week promised \u201cmajor changes\u201d in the government\u2019s response, but did not confirm if a stricter quarantine will be imposed. Roque said testing will be expanded and that the country will make greater use of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests. These tests, however, only detect antibodies and so have been criticised by some health experts, who say they are less accurate.\n\nIn other global developments:", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/31/global-report-china-records-most-daily-cases-since-march-poverty-fears-in-south-east-asia", "author": ["Helen Davidson", "Rebecca Ratcliffe"]}, {"title": "India arrests dozens of journalists in clampdown on critics of Covid-19 response", "text": "Facing a continuing upward trajectory in Covid-19 cases, the Indian government is clamping down on media coverage critical of its handling of the pandemic.\n\nMore than 50 Indian journalists have been arrested or had police complaints registered against them, or been physically assaulted.\n\nThe majority of those facing action are independent journalists working in rural India, home to more than 60% of the 1.35 billion population.\n\n\u201cThe indirect message is that we cannot show the government in poor light. It does not matter if we have to turn a blind eye to issues we witness,\u201d said Om Sharma, a journalist with a Hindi daily in Himachal Pradesh, a mountain state in north India. Police had charged him over a Facebook live report that showed stranded workers in need of food during the lockdown.\n\n\n\nSharma faced charges of spreading false information, disobeying the order of a public servant and acting negligently to spread infection of a dangerous disease.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest population lockdown was partially lifted last week after 10 weeks that saw many of the country\u2019s social and economic inequalities thrown into sharper focus, with the most vulnerable badly hit as their work vanished overnight. As of Thursday, 1.58 million people had had the virus and 38,000 had died.\n\n\n\nJust hours before announcing the lockdown, Narendra Modi, the prime minister, held a video conference with 20 owners and editors from India\u2019s largest print media organisations. \u201cIt was important to tackle the spread of pessimism, negativity and rumour,\u201d he told them. Modi\u2019s handling of the pandemic has been under increasing criticism as he has changed tack on policy and failed to curb the virus\u2019s spread, with India now the third worst affected country after the US and Brazil.\n\nIn a country where half-truths circulate over social media \u2013 in some cases spread by politicians \u2013 and dubious remedies have been pushed, the government argued before the supreme court that \u201cfake news\u201d triggered the exodus of day labourers from the cities. The court directed the media to \u201crefer to and publish the official version about the developments\u201d.\n\n\n\nJournalists complain that their freedoms are being curtailed. Sharma was refused a curfew pass by his local administration. He had no option but to work from home, relying on social media platforms, asking local people to share their issues.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the Committee to Protect Journalists wrote to the Himachal Pradesh government, resulting in the chief minister announcing that the cases against Sharma and five other journalists would be withdrawn.\n\nIn Jammu and Kashmir, reporters have alleged physical assaults by police. On 11 April, police slapped and used batons on Mushtaq Ahmed Ganai, a Srinagar-based reporter with the Kashmir Observer, before he was arrested. Ganai was out reporting on the lockdown at the time.\n\nCharged with disobedience under sections of the 123-year-old Epidemic Diseases Act, Ganai was held for more than 48 hours. Ganai said that the \u201cpress\u201d sticker was removed from his car before it was returned. The following day he was back in his office. \u201cJournalism is a passion, specifically for those in Kashmir. We cannot afford to back out,\u201d he said.\n\nThe media clampdown has added to the challenges of severe restrictions on movement. Moreover, access to lawyers has been limited and courts are still hearing only urgent cases.\n\nGeeta Seshu, of the Free Speech Collective, said the restrictions were having an impact on reporting. \u201cDuring the pandemic, the government has taken some crucial policy decisions regarding environment and railways. Most of the media organisations played safe by not reviewing these decisions,\u201d she said.\n\nIndia has now dropped two places to be ranked 142 out of 180 countries on the global press freedom index. Responding to this in May, India\u2019s information and broadcasting minister, Prakash Javadekar, tweeted: \u201cMedia in India enjoy absolute freedom.

Trump, who is rarely seen wearing a mask and has been critical of them, has more recently moved to advocating for their use \u2013 though he did not wear one during all of the event.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump at the American Red Cross national headquarters in Washington DC on 30 July.

They include personal emails between Epstein and Maxwell as well as information from a discussion between Giuffre and her lawyer.\n\nMany documents in this case have been subject to an intense legal battle. Maxwell\u2019s attorneys in the civil suit had argued to keep many records under seal, maintaining previously that \u201cthis series of pleadings concerns [attempts] to compel Ms Maxwell to answer intrusive questions about her sex life\u201d. The documents, they argued, are \u201cextremely personal, confidential and subject to considerable abuse by the media\u201d.\n\nManhattan federal court judge Loretta Preska ruled on 23 July to unseal them, however, saying: \u201cThe court finds that the countervailing interests identified fail to rebut the presumption of public access.\u201d\n\nDocuments involving Maxwell\u2019s deposition have not been released yet, as her lawyers are appealing their unsealing.\n\nFederal authorities arrested Maxwell on 2 July and charged her for allegedly participating in Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking. Maxwell, daughter of the late publishing baron Robert Maxwell, pleaded not guilty on 14 July. Maxwell has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Her lawyers have said she \u201cvigorously denies the charges\u201d and is \u201centitled to the presumption of innocence\u201d.\n\nThe documents released on Thursday help shed light on Maxwell and Epstein\u2019s personal relations. In one of the personal emails between Epstein and Maxwell, Epstein wrote on 25 January 2015: \u201cYou have done nothing wrong and i woudl [sic] urge you to start acting like it. \u201cGo outside, head high, not as an esacping[sic] convict. go to parties. deal with it.\u201d\n\nThe exchange followed a request from Maxwell, who was romantically linked to Epstein, to be distanced from his dating life.\n\nSome of them also relate to previous claims of Giuffre, such as former US President Bill Clinton riding on Epstein\u2019s plane, and allegations about lawyer Alan Dershowitz. Dershowitz, who had worked as Epstein\u2019s attorney, has repeatedly denied misconduct. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDuring brief questioning about Bill Clinton, the documents show Giuffre said she saw the former president on Epstein\u2019s island. Representatives for Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Clinton has distanced himself from Epstein, and in a 2019 statement a spokesperson said \u201cPresident Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.\u201d\n\nThe documents also show that Giuffre was asked in an interview whether Epstein ever bragged about the age of any girls with whom he had sexual relations. \u201cYes, he did. He did all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe worst one that I heard from his own mouth was this pretty 12 year old girls he had flown in for his birthday. It was a surprise birthday gift from one of his friends and they were from France,\u201d she alleged.\n\nEpstein told her powerful people owed him favors, Giuffre claimed, according to the documents. \u201cLots of people owed him favors from what he told me\u2026 That\u2019s why I believe he does so many favors in the first place.\u201d\n\nGiuffre was also asked whether Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew \u2013 whom she has claimed she had sex with as a teenager at Epstein\u2019s behest - would have information about the financier.\n\n\u201cHe would know a lot of the truth,\u201d she said.\n\nPrince Andrew has vehemently denied allegations of misconduct.\n\nMaxwell met Giuffre at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in south Florida, where the then teen was working as a locker-room attendant.\n\nIn the civil lawsuit, which has since been settled, Giuffre claimed that Maxwell had defamed her, by stating that she was a liar for accusing Epstein and Maxwell of sexual impropriety.\n\nAn extensive collection of documents in this suit was also unsealed last August. They featured both bombshell claims, and denials that world leaders participated in Epstein\u2019s alleged sex ring. These filings were disclosed shortly after Epstein\u2019s arrest last July. Epstein killed himself in jail last August.\n\nMaxwell is being held in jail pending trial, which is scheduled for next July.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/30/ghislaine-maxwell-documents-unsealed", "author": ["Victoria Bekiempis"]}, {"title": "Italian fashion brands called upon to tackle racism", "text": "Black fashion designers in Italy have called upon Gucci, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana to commit to eradicating racism in the country\u2019s fashion industry, accusing brands of prioritising performative gestures of support for the Black Lives Matter movement in the US at the expense of tackling discrimination closer to home.\n\nA letter written by designers Stella Jean and Edward Buchanan, entitled \u201cDo #BLM in Italian fashion?\u201d asks Italian fashion industry leaders to enact a plan of investment, education and monitoring, instead of a tokenistic approach which earlier this month resulted in no black-owned fashion brand showing at Milan fashion week.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s change (from) roundtables on diversity and workshops on the theories of multiculturalism \u2026 into true work, true collaboration\u201d the letter reads. \u201cOnly this will ensure that all of our constant sources of passive inspiration are transformed into valid and active agents of real change.\u201d\n\nMany of the larger Italian fashion houses have noted histories of featuring racist imagery. Infamously, this includes Gucci\u2019s blackface jumper, Prada\u2019s golliwog trinket and Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s pizza advert. And yet there is a reluctance to discuss the underlying issues openly.\n\nSpeaking to The Guardian in June, Buchanan said there was \u201cextreme fatigue\u201d around the admission of racism in the country. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t justify the constant denial,\u201d he said.\n\nThe incidents continue to occur. Earlier this week, label Marni was criticised online for the demeaning and colonialistic imagery used for their SS20 collection. Instagram account and self-appointed industry watchdog Diet Prada reported that the images featured a black model with chains lying suggestively close to his feet, and another which featured the phrase \u201cjungle mood\u201d juxtaposed next to a black model. The visual allusions had some commenting: \u201cThis is the worst example presenting black bodies through the white gaze.\u201d Marni later deleted the images and apologised saying: \u201cAs we endeavor to create a more equitable world \u2026 we sincerely regret that our efforts cause further pain.\u201d\n\nThe letter from Jean and Buchanan suggests there would be less moments of gross cultural insensitivity if there were black people in senior decision-making roles. \u201cMany of the mishaps and racially insensitive conversations that have happened in Italy are clearly due to companies not including black people internally from entry-level to executive positions,\u201d it says. \u201cThe oversights are clear every time a major gaffe is made.\u201d\n\nJean said racism in Italian fashion continues to be the elephant in the room. \u201c(I am) well aware that racism is one of the most uncomfortable topics in Italy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut trust me, the topic is not less uncomfortable than being the first and only black-owned brand in the history of a white-only fashion council (the current ratio is 1 out of 113) . We can all agree that the only way to dismantle the issue is to acknowledge it.\u201d She added she hoped some changes would be in effect by the next Milan fashion week, which begins on 22 September.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/31/italian-fashion-brands-called-upon-to-tackle-racism", "author": ["Priya Elan"]}, {"title": "UK waste incinerators three times more likely to be in deprived areas", "text": "Waste incinerators are three times more likely to be situated in the most deprived and ethnically diverse areas of the UK, it has been revealed, raising fears about the impact on air quality and the health of vulnerable people.\n\nData obtained by Unearthed, the investigative arm of Greenpeace, found that areas in the top 20% for deprivation host nearly one-third of the waste incinerators in the UK. The richest, least ethnically diverse areas are home to less than 10% of incinerators, which are increasingly being used to deal with the UK\u2019s waste.\n\nCommunities living in and around waste incinerators are increasingly concerned at the impact on air quality, noise and traffic pollution, and the impact on their health. As local authorities seek to reduce landfill, incineration is increasingly being used to deal with waste. The amount of waste incinerated in the UK increased from 4.9m tonnes in 2014 to 10.8m tonnes in 2017-18.\n\nMeanwhile, recycling rates are falling, with the government likely to miss a target of 50% recycling in 2020. The UK recycling rate was 45.0% in 2018, down from 45.5% in 2017.\n\nUnearthed identified 90 incinerators in the UK, many of which are run by companies such as Viridor, Veolia and Suez. These include energy-from-waste incinerators, hospital waste incinerators and waste wood incinerators. There are also 50 more proposed or in development, according to government data and data collected by the anti-incineration group UKWIN.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the potential incinerators in England are planned for the northern half of the country.\n\nTwenty-eight waste incinerators are located in the 20% most deprived and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods in the UK. The 50 incinerators planned or in development are also three times more likely to be built in the poorest than the richest areas, and nearly half are on track to be built in the UK\u2019s top 25% most deprived neighbourhoods.\n\n\u2018Compelling\u2019 evidence air pollution worsens coronavirus \u2013 study Read more\n\nSam Chetan Welsh, political campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \u201cIncinerators are an unnecessary byproduct of our addiction to single-use, throwaway items. They stink, increase traffic, noise, pollution and litter, and industrialise an area. You can\u2019t just dump the majority of them in deprived neighbourhoods because they\u2019re already run-down and not expect to entrench inequalities.\n\n\u201cWe have a planning process that is systemically racist and classist, and the government and local authorities need to take action to change that.\u201d\n\nThe huge increase in the use of incinerators comes despite political support for burning waste falling away. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is calling on the government to stop permitting the building of what he calls \u201carchaic\u201d polluting waste incinerators. Khan is opposing the building of an incinerator in Bexley, which he says will raise harmful nitrogen oxide pollution levels.\n\nLondon \u2013 which has seven incinerators and more in development \u2013 has the highest incineration rate (54%) in the UK for management of local authority waste, yet the lowest recycling rate (30%). Sites in Blackburn, Sheffield, Glasgow, Kirklees, Birmingham, Peterborough and Edmonton all host waste incinerators and are among the most deprived areas in the UK.\n\nSix incinerators are currently sited in Scotland and two in Wales. But six of the proposed incinerators are in the area between Swansea and Cardiff alone, and seven are in Scotland.\n\nNeighbourhoods in the wealthiest 20% of areas host just eight of the 90 current incinerators. Last month Robert Jenrick, the secretary of state for communities and local government, upheld a decision to refuse permission for an incinerator in Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, after residents raised concerns that the facility would destroy views of Ely Cathedral and ruin its historic place in the Fens.\n\nIn a report last year, Public Health England said there were no ill effects to health from municipal waste incinerators (MWIs), following the publication of the largest and most detailed analysis to date of the effects of MWIs on public health in the UK.\n\nBut campaigners say not enough attention has been paid to microscopic air pollution from incinerators. A study by Zero Waste Europe suggests even state-of-the-art modern incinerators emit dangerous pollutants. Earlier this year, MPs rejected an amendment to the environment bill that would have made the UK\u2019s particulate matter pollution targets adhere to stricter WHO guidelines.\n\nShlomo Dowen, national coordinator of UKWIN, said: \u201cPublic concerns about adverse health impacts associated, both directly and indirectly, with incinerators and poor air quality are not assuaged by PHE statements.\n\n\u201cPeople want to see much stronger regulation of waste incinerators and other industrial processes that contribute to worsening air quality.\u201d\n\nDowen said that as well as public health concerns, data shows that areas with high incineration rates have lower recycling rates. He said the growth of incineration of waste which can and should be recycled went against government policy statements on creating a circular economy.\n\n\u201cIncineration is an expensive and outdated technology that has no part to play in the closed-loop circular economy towards which we are moving.\u201d\n\nThe Environmental Services Association, which represents the UK waste industry, said: \u201cEnergy recovery facilities serve a vital public function and, in accordance with the waste hierarchy, divert millions of tonnes of UK waste from landfill every year.\n\n\u201cTheir operation is approved by Public Health England and permitted by the Environment Agency, and each plant is only granted a permit if the agency determines it is in an appropriate location; any and all appropriate risk mitigation is in place; and the plant can meet its permit conditions.

No. But I don\u2019t want to see a crooked election.

In 2017, the Brennan Center for Justice ranked the risk of ballot fraud at 0.00004% to 0.0009%, based on studies of past elections.\n\n\n\nAnalysts said the president\u2019s chief objective was to sow doubt about the legitimacy of the outcome. Richard Painter, a former White House chief ethics lawyer, said: \u201cHe\u2019s just trying to intimidate people. He wants to suppress the vote as much as he can and so he wants to discourage mail-in and, of course, he wants to complain about the election being rigged if he loses.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe pulled this in 2016 \u2013 he thought he was going to lose that and he said it was a rigged election.

Places of worship are open to visitors but people must socially distance from other households, as well as taking mitigations such as wearing face masks, and the government recommends religious services take place outdoors, if possible.\n\nWhat about people wanting to meet with family and friends to celebrate Eid?\n\nPeople in the affected areas should not visit or host friends or family in private homes or gardens, the government says, nor should they meet and mix in restaurants or cafes. Two households, or up to six people from different households may meet outdoors in public spaces but social distancing must be maintained for those who do not live together.\n\nMosques may be attended but social distancing must be maintained between households. \u201cThis means maintaining a distance of 2 metres, or 1 metre with mitigations (such as wearing face coverings).

The same measures apply to Bradford.\n\nWhat about the rules for the rest of England?\n\nOutside of the affected areas, the lockdown guidance remains the same for the rest of England. People are allowed to meet in groups of two households in any location, including inside private homes. Outdoors, up to six people from different households can meet up.

People cannot stay overnight at another house or meet in private gardens.\u201d\n\nLisa Nandy, Labour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary and the MP for Wigan, said she had been told that the guidance applied to homes and gardens, but that people would still be allowed to visit public spaces \u201cwhere social distancing measures are in place\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cI know people are really worried about what they can and can\u2019t do in just a few hours time. The way the government has announced this has been an absolute shambles and made it harder to follow advice. Please do what you can and we will keep trying to get clarity ASAP.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Hancock said he had ordered the lockdown due to an \u201cincreasing rate of transmission in parts of northern England\u201d that was \u201clargely due to households meeting and not abiding to social distancing\u201d.\n\nHe said that from midnight \u201cpeople from different households will not be allowed to meet each other indoors\u201d in Greater Manchester, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle, Rossendale, Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees and the city of Leicester.\n\nIn 13 of the 19 local authority areas affected, the rate of Covid-19 in the seven days to 27 July has gone up, with 1,536 cases recorded across all the areas in the space of a week.\n\nHancock added: \u201cWe take this action with a heavy heart, but we can see increasing rates of Covid across Europe and are determined to do whatever is necessary to keep people safe.\u201d\n\nIn a press release sent to the media at 11.19pm \u2013 41 minutes before the new rules came into effect \u2013 the government said police forces would be given the power to enforce the restrictions to prevent households from mixing in homes or gardens.\n\n\n\nIt said exemptions would be put in place, including for the vulnerable, but gave no further details. It said full guidance would be published online, but did not give a timeframe.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said families in the affected areas were allowed to go to pubs and bars but that \u201ctwo households should not go to hospitality together\u201d.\n\nThe DHSC said the new restrictions would \u201ccome as a blow\u201d to those planning to celebrate Eid al-Adha this weekend, adding: \u201cMosques and other places of worship have reopened for prayer and communal worship, but in a different socially distanced and Covid-19-secure way. This means that while mosques can remain open, many will not able to welcome as many worshippers as before.\u201d\n\nThe government also announced that the full local lockdown in Leicester would be partially lifted, allowing restaurants, bars, cinemas, museums and hairdressers to reopen from Monday and for religious ceremonies to take place. However, leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed in the city.\n\nJason McCartney, the Conservative MP for Colne Valley in West Yorkshire, said he expressed \u201csurprise and disappointment\u201d with the government and Dido Harding, the executive in charge of the NHS test and trace system, that his constituency was included in the new restrictions.\n\nThe move came on the day that Hancock warned of a second wave of coronavirus \u201crolling across Europe\u201d and as health officials have been anxiously looking at rising rates across large parts of northern England.\n\nOne source briefed by health ministers said the rules were \u201cpotentially contradictory\u201d, but that they were designed to clamp down specifically on transmission within households, which is where most recent cases have been spreading.\n\nMinisters are concerned that people are less likely to observe social distancing if they invite others into their homes, it is understood, and are particularly worried about young people having house parties.\n\nThe rules, as they have been understood by local political leaders, mean that families will be required to to stay in their own so-called \u201csupport bubble\u201d \u2013 their own household \u2013 if they do visit a pub or a restaurant.\n\n\u201cThis is not a wide-ranging thing \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t have agreed to that \u2013 and it is potentially contradictory but what they\u2019re getting at is that in gardens and homes people don\u2019t observe distancing but in regulated, more formal environments like pubs, they do,\u201d they said.\n\nThe announcement was welcomed by Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, who said there had been a \u201cmarked change\u201d in the situation in the region of nearly 3 million people in recent days.\n\nBurnham said cases had risen in nine out of 10 boroughs in Greater Manchester this week, having been falling last week. In Rochdale, the one borough where cases had fallen, the rates were still too high, he said.\n\nSeveral of the areas affected by the new rules \u2013 Leicester, Blackburn with Darwen, Oldham and part of Wakefield \u2013 had already imposed localised restrictions in recent weeks in an attempt to curb the rising infection rates.\n\nIn many of the areas, the recent jump in cases had been attributed to an increase in transmission in multi-generation households, generally in more deprived parts of the towns and cities, and with many working in at-risk occupations such as warehouse workers, taxi drivers, and health and care staff.\n\nMuslims in some northern towns, such as Blackburn with Darwen and Oldham, had been told the celebrate Eid al-Adha at home and not to allow visitors as the majority of the recent cases had been in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities and were predominantly among younger people, aged 20 to 40.\n\nHowever, the imposition of blanket restrictions covering an area of at least 5 million people suggests transmission has spread much more widely.\n\nIt was announced late on Thursday that some of the restrictions would be eased in Leicester, where the UK\u2019s first full local lockdown was imposed a month ago, with pubs, cafes and restaurants reopening in the Midlands city from Monday.\n\nThe DHSC said hairdressers, cinemas and museums would also be able to open, but social gathering restrictions would remain in place for the city and leisure centres, gyms and public swimming pools would also remain closed. All restrictions in neighbouring Oadby and Wigston would be lifted, the department added.\n\nAdditional reporting by Peter Walker", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/30/lockdown-tightened-in-parts-of-northern-england-with-ban-on-indoor-meetings", "author": ["Josh Halliday"]}, {"title": "Statistics chief rebukes Sturgeon claim Covid-19 five times lower in Scotland than England", "text": "Claim not based on verifiable data and should not have been made, says Ed Humpherson\n\nNicola Sturgeon has been censured by the UK\u2019s chief statistician after using incomplete and unpublished data to claim the coronavirus was five times less prevalent in Scotland than in England.\n\nEd Humpherson, the director general of the Office for Statistics Regulation, said the first minister\u2019s claims earlier in July were not based on comparable or published data, and should not have been made. \u201cThe sources used to underpin this claim have been difficult to identify,\u201d he told Sturgeon\u2019s government.\n\nIn an official letter to Roger Halliday, the Scottish government\u2019s chief statistician, Humpherson said he did not believe the sources used by Sturgeon were robust enough, after an investigation into complaints about her statements.\n\nAfter analysing the data sources given to him by Sturgeon\u2019s officials, he told Halliday: \u201cWe do not think that the sources [provided] allow for a quantified and uncaveated comparison of the kind that was made.

There had been 2,000 deaths of people confirmed to have Covid-19 in England in the last month, compared with nine in Scotland.\n\nSturgeon said earlier this month she was worried that Scotland could be put at risk because of \u201cshambolic\u201d policies on foreign travel and air bridges, which were being pushed by ministers in England.\n\nOn 3 July, she said she would resist pressure to agree quickly to the UK government\u2019s proposals for quarantine-free travel from other countries with low infection rates, because she wanted to ensure that Scotland\u2019s steep decline in Covid-19 cases was protected.\n\n\u201cWhen so much is at stake, as it is right now, we can\u2019t allow ourselves to be dragged along in the wake of another government\u2019s \u2013 to be quite frank about it \u2013 shambolic decision-making process,\u201d she said then. \u201cWe assess that the prevalence of the virus in Scotland, right now, is five times lower than it is in England. Northern Ireland actually faces a similar issue.\u201d\n\nQuick guide Will there be a second wave of coronavirus? Show Hide The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in \u201cone big wave\u201d with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the World Health Organization has warned. Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19. How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity. Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave? This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden resurgence in infections despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak. Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in cramped dormitory accommodation used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens. Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it. In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions. What are experts worried about? Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies. However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says \u201c\u2018Second wave\u2019 isn\u2019t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn\u2019t gone away, it\u2019s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.\u201d The overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available. In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with a vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves. Peter Beaumont, Emma Graham-Harrison and Martin Belam\n\nHumpherson said that claim could not be substantiated. The Scottish government had used Scottish modelling by its experts and compared it with unpublished modelling from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which used a UK figure as a proxy for England. It then used other data from the Office for National Statistics, which was based on a different time period and estimates than the Scottish data.\n\nHumpherson said Sturgeon should have shared the sources and justification for her comparison because it used unpublished data. \u201cThere are lessons to be learned in this case, with different data sources being quoted to the media and to us. We expect that any figures used are appropriately sourced, explained and available in the public domain,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a further letter about the figures, David Norgrove, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, told Tory MSP Miles Briggs the sources given by the Scottish government to justify Sturgeon\u2019s assertion \u201cdo not allow for a meaningful comparison to be made\u201d.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/30/nicola-sturgeon-statistics-chief-rebukes-sturgeon-claim-covid-19-five-times-lower-in-scotland-than-england", "author": ["Severin Carrell"]}, {"title": "Greece's refugees face healthcare crisis as Lesbos Covid-19 centre closes", "text": "In a fresh blow to refugees and migrants experiencing dire conditions in Greece, frontline medical charity M\u00e9decins San Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) on Thursday announced it has been forced to closed its Covid-19 isolation centre on Lesbos after authorities imposed fines and potential charges.\n\nFrom the island of Lesbos to the Greek capital of Athens, asylum seekers and recognised refugees, some with serious medical conditions, are unable to access healthcare or see a doctor as treatments are disrupted by new regulations.\n\nAsmaan* from Afghanistan is 10. For eight months she has lived in a makeshift tent with her family on the outskirts of the olive grove surrounding the Moria camp on Lesbos. She is one of more than 17,000 asylum seekers and refugees who have been living under lockdown here since 23 March.\n\nAsmaan is a familiar face at the paediatric clinic run by MSF just outside the main gate. \u201cShe was vomiting, shivering through the nights and became apathetic,\u201d said her mother Sharif*. \u201cWe really became alarmed when she was bleeding going to the toilet.\u201d Diagnosed with an acute inflammation of her kidney, Asmaan was transferred to the island\u2019s hospital. Sharif said staff wanted to send her daughter to the mainland for treatment. But the family cannot leave Lesbos until their asylum procedure is completed.\n\n\u201cOnly highly severe cases can be transferred to the mainland,\u201d Babis Anitsakis, director of infectious diseases at the hospital in Mytilene, told the Guardian. \u201cThis is also the case for the local population.\u201d Such cases often involve a wait of two to three months in the camp before a transfer can be arranged, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are confronted with patients from Moria daily who have sicknesses like tuberculosis or HIV. We are simply not equipped for these treatments. On top of it, we face tremendous translation difficulties. At night the medical staff work with a phone translation app to communicate with the patients, which can be disastrous in an emergency situation.\u201d\n\nSome of the refugees on the streets of Athens are heavily pregnant women and new mothers. Photograph: Faris Al-Jawad/MSF\n\nFor Giovanna Scaccabarozzi, a doctor with MSF on Lesbos, Asmaan\u2019s case is typical of a system where refugees and asylum seekers find it increasingly difficult to access proper healthcare, often despite being in desperate need.\n\n\u201cEven survivors of torture and sexual violence are now left to themselves with no one to talk to and with no possibility to escape the highly re-traumatising space of Moria,\u201d she said. The camp\u2019s lockdown has meant fewer people have been able to attend MSF\u2019s mental health clinic in Mytilene.\n\n\u201cFrom five to 10 appointments a day, we are now down to two to three a week in the torture clinic in town,\u201d Scaccabarozzi said. Even when people reach the clinic, \u201cit feels like treating someone with a burn while the person is still standing in the fire\u201d.\n\nThe closure of the Covid-19 isolation unit on Thursday is down to the island\u2019s authorities enforcing planning regulations, MSF said. \u201cWe are deeply disappointed that local authorities could not quash these fines and potential charges in the light of the global pandemic, despite some efforts from relevant stakeholders,\u201d said Stephan Oberreit, MSF\u2019s head of mission in Greece. \u201cThe public health system on Lesbos would simply be unable to handle the devastation caused by an outbreak in Moria \u2013 which is why we stepped in. Today we had to unwillingly close a crucial component of the Covid-19 response for Moria.\u201d\n\nAthens has become a beacon of hope for those living in the island\u2019s overcrowded camps, but a recent policy change has seen people who arrive in Athens with refugee status left virtually destitute, many with ongoing healthcare issues.\n\nThe changes, which mean cash assistance and accommodation support end a month after refugee status is granted, affect around 11,000 refugees in Greece. MSF told the Guardian it is concerned that a number of patients face eviction and many refugees in Athens are sleeping on the streets as a result.\n\nHadla, a 59-year-old from Aleppo who had had multiple heart attacks, died within days of leaving the apartment she shared with her daughter Dalal in Athens. She had been asked to leave repeatedly. \u201cI told them that my mother is terribly ill and showed them the medical files but they told us that they cannot do anything about it and that the decision had come from the ministry,\u201d said Dalal.\n\nFearing eviction, Dalal took her mother to Schisto refugee camp on the outskirts of Athens, where her brother was staying. Two days later Hadla had another cardiac arrest and died. Dalal is still in the apartment with the rest of her family but continues to face eviction. \u201cWe have nothing and nowhere to go,\u201d she said.\n\nKelly Moraiti, a nurse at the MSF daycare centre in Athens, said evictions put patients\u2019 health at risk, particularly those living with diseases such as diabetes. \u201cSomeone who is facing a lifelong disease should have uninterrupted permanent access to treatment. They need to have access to a proper diet and a space to store medications, which should not be exposed to the sun; to be homeless with these conditions is extremely dangerous.\u201d\n\nMSF urgently called on the Greek government and the EU to help house refugees sleeping rough in Athens and to halt evictions of vulnerable people.\n\nSome of the refugees on the streets of Athens are heavily pregnant women and new mothers as well as survivors of torture and sexual violence. Many have significant health conditions often complicated from their time in camps such as Moria.\n\nThe Greek migration ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n* Names changed or shortened for privacy reasons", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/31/greece-refugee-healthcare-crisis-island-camps-lesbos-moria-coronavirus", "author": ["Katy Fallon"]}, {"title": "\u2018We could see this tsunami of people coming\u2019: inside the secret world of intensive care", "text": "In early March, Mike Brunner, an intensive care doctor at Northwick Park hospital in north London, saw his first few Covid-19 patients. They were arriving with mild coughs, but just hours later were relying on oxygen tanks to breathe, their lungs on the brink of collapse. Within days, three patients became seven, then 20, and from then on, said Brunner, \u201cwe were in it\u201d.\n\nFor a while, Brunner felt as if he and his colleagues were the only ones who saw the huge change coming. \u201cWe could see this tsunami of people coming at us, and yet nobody else did,\u201d said Brunner. Driving through London on his way to work, past people crowded together in shops and pubs and cafes, he felt as if no one understood that very soon life was not going to be the same. \u201cIt was an incredibly lonely feeling,\u201d he said.\n\nStepping on to the ICU during this period was like entering another world. In a way, Brunner said, intensive care has always seemed like a place removed from life outside. The ward itself is hidden away behind closed doors, and inside, the only sound is the gentle, regular beeping of machines. \u201cBecause of all the machinery and complicated language we use, it has a unique atmosphere,\u201d said Brunner. \u201cIt can be quite intimidating.\u201d\n\nBy mid-March, intensive care was at the centre of the unfolding drama. ICUs were expanded to deal with the most serious Covid-19 cases, while surrounding wards were quickly repurposed to support them. As the crisis deepened and the prime minister himself was, for a brief period, cared for by an ICU team, critical care soon occupied a new place in the UK\u2019s consciousness. Numbers of critical cases have since declined across most of the country, but Brunner said he and his team are still working harder than ever before.\n\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, it was precisely because ICUs treated the sickest patients that they were isolated from the rest of the hospital. In TV and films, they are often presented as eerie and remote places, glimpsed briefly as a pair of feet disappears through the swinging doors into a bright, white light. \u201cPatients who leave may have had no idea where they have been,\u201d one nurse told me.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The ICU at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh in May. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nStudies have shown that few patients remember being admitted to intensive care, and most are disorientated when they wake up. The use of sedatives such as benzodiazepines mean that some leave with the idea they have been to a different place entirely. One doctor told me about an intensive care patient who converted to Catholicism after believing that they had been in a church where a nun had guided them through their treatment. The \u201cnun\u201d, the hospital team realised, was an oxygen tank whose white neck and black base must have looked like a habit. (The patient is still a practising Catholic.) Another doctor remembered a patient who was convinced they had been kidnapped by Colombian pirates. It is likely, this doctor said, that the hallucination was caused by a combination of the water-bed used to transport the patient and the Spanish-speaking nurses around them. These memories can leave patients traumatised and confused. Nowadays, an important part of ICU care is provided by a follow-up clinic that allows patients to return to the ward and speak to the staff who cared for them.\n\nFor many working in intensive care, these past few months have been not just gruelling and emotionally brutal, but also inspiring. \u201cWe have been able to give of ourselves what we always wanted to, and we are working very closely together to find answers,\u201d one doctor told me. \u201cI\u2019ve remembered why I chose to do intensive care in the first place.\u201d\n\nWhen the NHS was born, more than 70 years ago, intensive care was not a recognised specialism, even though healthcare professionals across the world have long known that close monitoring can improve the chances of recovery for the sickest patients. The world\u2019s first intensive care unit was opened in Copenhagen in 1953, by the anaesthetist Bj\u00f8rn Ibsen, following a polio epidemic the previous year. Polio can cause paralysis and respiratory failure, and during the outbreak Ibsen had discovered that, after administering an anaesthetic, he was able to manually inflate and deflate the lungs of patients by rhythmically squeezing a rubber bag attached to a tracheostomy tube. Using this crude machine continuously, he and his helpers managed to keep patients alive until they recovered enough to breathe unaided. This use of machinery and constant monitoring became the basis of his intensive care practice.\n\nOn the frontline: meet the NHS workers tackling coronavirus Read more\n\nFrom the 60s onwards, ICUs were established across the UK, bringing together teams of skilled staff to support people with failing organs. With continuing developments in technology came more sophisticated monitoring techniques and life-support machines. Among the most notable was the pulmonary artery catheter, which was developed at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London by Dr Margaret Branthwaite and Prof Ron Bradley. It involved inserting a tube into a pulmonary artery to monitor its pressure, which could be used to diagnose serious problems such as sepsis or heart failure. When Prof Hugh Montgomery, who today works as an ICU consultant at the Whittington Hospital in north London, began his medical training under Bradley, he was among the first people to receive intensive-care training.\n\nLike many ICU staff, Montgomery felt that before Covid-19, many people \u201cwere blind to the existence of intensive care\u201d. During the height of the outbreak, the talk was all about ventilators \u2013 machines used to move air into and out of the lungs of a patient who cannot breathe unaided \u2013 but, said Montgomery, intensive care is about much more than breathing and ventilators. \u201cOften the patients who come to us are suffering from multi-organ failure, which requires a series of very complex treatments,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause intensive care patients need to be closely monitored, ICUs have the highest nurse-to-patient ratio in a hospital \u2013 usually one to one. At the peak of the crisis, the number of patients increased and their average length of stay in the ICU became longer. At times, Montgomery\u2019s department had only one ICU nurse to six patients. \u201cWorking as an ICU nurse is like flying a plane,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is highly skilled and they cannot take their eyes from the controls. They are very, very clever people.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bathing a patient on a ventilator in the ICU at the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nAmong the hardest decisions intensive care staff have to make are about who to admit to their ward, and when. In the UK, intensive care beds tend to be limited, and available only to the most dangerously ill patients, but there is an ongoing debate about whether patients should be offered critical care before they get to this stage. \u201cThe idea of having a relatively small ICU for only the very sickest is historically quite a British thing, which is now changing \u2013 but unevenly so \u2013 across the country,\u201d said Ganesh Suntharalingam, an anaesthetist and intensive care doctor at Northwick Park, who is also president of the Intensive Care Society (ICS), the leading charity in the UK for the support of intensive-care professionals. Bringing patients into intensive care at a lower threshold of severity may allow earlier and less invasive treatment, and increase chances of a better recovery. \u201cKeeping you alive while you are at your sickest is only part of what we do,\u201d said Suntharalingam. \u201cICU is just as much about ensuring and reinforcing your recovery.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, for instance, physiotherapists have played a crucial role in intensive care, helping Covid-19 patients who have been ventilated for long periods. By doing breathing exercises with patients, they help them prepare for the moment when the ventilator tube is taken away and they start to breathe on their own again.\n\nTalking to me from the staffroom at the Royal Preston hospital, where the intensive care unit has swelled to seven times its usual size, Dr Shondipon Laha, critical care consultant at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals, said that many patients they had seen had been suffering from sticky secretions in the lungs, and have relied on manual techniques to clear their airways. That\u2018s another point when the physiotherapists step in. \u201cWe\u2019re like the snowploughs of the ventilator world,\u201d said Molly Koziarska, a physiotherapist who was working with Laha. Koziarska recalled a recent example where, after a patient in the ICU collapsed with damaged lungs, she was brought in to manually inflate the lungs using handheld bags, and then physically shake the patient to dislodge the secretions. \u201cWe may then ask a patient to cough afterwards to clear their chest \u2013 I think we are the only group to ask patients to do this during covid!\u201d\n\nFor all ICU staff, the initial stages of dealing with Covid-19 were defined by uncertainty. After 27 years of working in ICUs, Hugh Montgomery said he felt as though he was a student again. \u201cWe had to start from the beginning with this,\u201d he said. Seeing how the lungs reacted to Covid-19 was especially shocking. \u201cThe blood vessels in the lungs were behaving in a really odd way \u2013 like nothing I\u2019ve seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember feeling cheated, as if our patients were not playing by the rules.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic has brought together intensive-care professionals from around the world, trying to make sense of what they were seeing. The evening before we talked, Montgomery had chaired an online conference call with the World Health Organization and clinicians from nine different countries including China, the US, Germany and Spain. The call was hosted by the ICS and allowed clinicians to share ideas on topics such as CPAP ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure), fluid balance and antibiotic use. \u201cSeeing Hugh bring out clinicians to share their experiences is like watching a conductor in an orchestra,\u201d said Sandy Mather, the CEO of the ICS, who coordinates these meetings.\n\nThis is the first global outbreak in which digital resources have been widely available, and Mather said the online ICS conferences have been crucial in allowing clinicians to learn from colleagues in other countries, ahead of the virus\u2019s march across the world. \u201cWhat\u2019s so moving is the dedication you see in clinicians to improve care,\u201d said Mather. \u201cMany participants are coming off an 18-hour shift, and yet they are there, speaking English as a second language, sharing lessons and wanting to learn how to improve their practice.\u201d\n\nAcross Britain, intensive care departments have been taking part in trials of potential treatments. Among them is the Recovery trial, the biggest randomised controlled trial of drugs against Covid-19 in the world. It has recently shown positive results with the freely available and cheap drug dexamethasone, and further results are keenly awaited.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The entrance to the ICU at University Hospital Coventry, April 2020. Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian\n\nIn his intensive care unit in Preston, Laha has been running research into possible treatments. Although it is the biggest, coronavirus is not the first pandemic Laha has experienced. In 2009, during his second year as an intensive care consultant in Lancashire, the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, spread across the world. \u201cThe 2009 pandemic overwhelmed us,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember thinking we didn\u2019t have the capacity for it, even though, like the coronavirus, we all knew it was coming.\u201d\n\nH1N1 was forgotten about as quickly as it had started. Afterwards, Laha said, there was \u201cno consideration of how intensive care could be improved nationally, so that we were more prepared\u201d. He is worried that the same thing will happen after the current pandemic is over. \u201cWe have to be more prepared for when this happens again, which it is likely to. Pandemics may happen three or four times a century.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the virus is often measured by mortality rate. However, as numbers of deaths in the UK are \u2013 for the time being \u2013 declining, the focus for many healthcare workers is now the prospects of recovery for those who leave intensive care. \u201cThere appears to be an assumption that admission to an ICU is like a magic golden ticket \u2013 you survive and are fully back to normal,\u201d said Laha. But it\u2019s not always like that.\n\nA few years ago, one patient, who had been receiving intensive care treatment for an aggressive tongue cancer, began hallucinating in hospital. In her mind\u2019s eye, she would see the surgeon who had been treating her in the form of a butcher trying to kill her. These visions continued as nightmares long after her stay in the ICU. Soon the patient developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which was triggered by sensory experiences that reminded her of the ICU: cool air, certain smells, memories of her hallucinations. \u201cShe thought she was going mad,\u201d said Kate Tantam, an ICU sister at University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know that delirium was so common and completely normal, and so kept it to herself.\u201d\n\nThe phrase post-intensive care syndrome, or Pics, was first used around 2010 to describe the collection of symptoms sometimes seen in ICU patients after discharge: cognitive impairments, mental health issues and physical health problems. Tantam said people are often shocked when they learn about Pics. She is finding that some Covid-19 patients discharged from intensive care are suffering from severe muscle weakness, while others have experienced delirium.\n\nTantam has long campaigned for a rehabilitation team to be embedded within the critical care structure. Her campaign began more than a decade ago, after she read an NHS questionnaire filled out by a young woman who had been treated at her hospital. The woman was close in age to Tantam, and went into the ICU when she was pregnant. During her six-week stay, she lost the baby. She had suffered terrible delirium, which later gave her PTSD. She was physically weak for a long time after leaving hospital. \u201cIt was a story that broke me,\u201d said Tantam. \u201cAt the time I had just come back from maternity leave, and although I never met her, I felt really close to her and wanted to do something.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Staff removing PPE after a ward round at the ICU in the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nWithout proper rehab, Tantam thought, the ICU did not make sense: \u201cOtherwise, what\u2019s the point of what we do? What\u2019s the point of keeping someone alive if they have no quality of life?\u201d One of her first steps was to make a case for the importance of physiotherapists, who can begin exercises with patients while they are in the ICU and may be experiencing muscle loss and atrophy. \u201cOften our patients need to be taught to walk again, breathe again, swallow again and talk again. That takes time, and it needs a team of people.\u201d\n\nDuring their stay in an ICU, at least 45% of patients experience delirium, according to a report in Annals of Intensive Care. \u201cDrugs do not stop a patient from getting delirium in ICU,\u201d said Tantam. \u201cThey need specialised therapy and psychological care after.\u201d On leaving intensive care, in around a quarter of cases, delirium can lead to PTSD. Among her previous patients, Tantam recalled some who have thought she was trying to kill them, and mothers who imagined she and her colleagues were trying to kill their children. \u201cI have had patients who after treatment have asked me or other nurses questions like, \u2018Why did you tie me up in the plane when it was crashing?\u2019, or \u2018Why did you let that man abuse me?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt took four years for Tantam to assemble her rehab team. She found there was not much interest, because it didn\u2019t have that \u201csaving lives\u201d quality \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s about saving dreams\u201d she said. Since March, Tantam and her multi-disciplinary rehab team \u2013 physiotherapists, psychologists, nurses, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians \u2013 have been able to work across the whole hospital, seeing every Covid-19 patient. \u201cThe impact of this was remarkable,\u201d Tantam said. \u201cEvery Covid-19 ICU patient has left the hospital walking. This is huge.\u201d\n\n\u2018When dealing with patients at the extremes of life,\u201d writes Aoife Abbey, a doctor at University Hospital Coventry in her memoir The Seven Signs of Life, \u201cthere is an onus on doctors to be alert for the time when the burden of treatment outweighs the expected benefit for a patient. It is imperative that medicine knows when it is time to work with death, if it is to work at all. Intensive care, perhaps more than any other speciality, is defined by this specific sort of responsibility.\u201d\n\nDuring these months of treating Covid-19 patients, Abbey has seen patients come in with severe acute respiratory failure. Some patients stood to benefit from intensive care, while for others the escalation of treatments, including invasive forms of ventilation, were not deemed to be in their best interest.\n\nThe established ethical frameworks used to make these kinds of decisions have remained the same when treating patients with Covid-19. What has changed is the nature of the communication with patients and their families. According to Mike Brunner, one of the toughest parts of working in the ICU during this time has been seeing patients die without the company of their families. In many cases, staff have been the ones communicating messages of support, or holding someone\u2019s hand in place of a friend or partner. Brunner remembers sitting with one nurse \u2013 who, before being moved to the ICU, had been working in the operating theatre \u2013 while she held the hand of a patient as he died. \u201cIt was very difficult for her, and she was distraught, but she stayed with her patient, holding his hand and comforting him while he died. She epitomised the care and compassion of all our healthcare workers.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An intensive care bed at the Western General, Edinburgh. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nAs the weeks have rolled by, Brunner said, he has become more aware of his own mortality. \u201cYou do worry, especially when you are looking after people who are your age. One morning I woke up and I just could not stop crying. My sister called and I just found myself telling her where my will was, and then weirdly, I felt better. Never have I worried about contracting anything that my patients have had \u2013 Aids, swine flu \u2013 it just hasn\u2019t crossed my mind.\u201d\n\nMany doctors I spoke to were worried about how intensive care staff will cope when the NHS has to operate as normal again while caring for patients who are still recovering from the virus. Andre Vercueil has noticed that patterns have been changing in his ICU in south London. The hospital is experiencing higher numbers of trauma patients than they would normally have seen before the outbreak. Patients have been admitted to his ward after self-harming, taking drug overdoses or jumping off buildings. Admissions of patients with mental health issues are also on the rise. Vercueil said the changes he and his team in the ICU have witnessed have held up a mirror to society \u2013 \u201cand not a very flattering one\u201d.\n\n'The past six weeks have been unlike anything I\u2019ve known': a GP on how the pandemic has changed his work Read more\n\nNevertheless, ICUs do things that few, if any, other hospital departments can. After we spoke on the phone in March, Kate Tantam, the sister in Plymouth, sent me some photos of flowers being planted in a garden behind her ward, which she and her team had been working on for the past few months. When we spoke again last month, she told me the garden is now finished, and that she and her team had been taking patients out there.\n\nFor some, it was a place to build up strength after treatment, to see some greenery and to remind them of the world outside their ward. For others, it was to take them outside one last time. \u201cWe cannot save everyone,\u201d said Tantam. \u201cOur job as nurses is to also facilitate a good death, and I\u2019m lucky to be in a team who is working hard to do both.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/30/secret-world-intensive-care-unit-hospitals-critical-care-coronavirus", "author": ["Sarah Whitehead"]}, {"title": "Headie One: 'In prison, the only thing not taken away from you is yourself'", "text": "The Tottenham rapper is UK drill\u2019s biggest star \u2013 and counts Drake as a fan. He talks about how his music gave him a way out of crime, and the difficulty of leaving his old life behind\n\nThe north London district of Tottenham seems to offer up a rap icon for every generation. Hip-hop group Demon Boyz were among the first to shed American accents in the 1980s; in the late 00s, 16-year-old MC Chip declared himself a \u201cgrime scene saviour\u201d, and cracked the glass ceiling of a resistant music industry. More recently, Skepta has led British rap into the mainstream, winning the Mercury prize in 2016.\n\nThe district where riots blazed in 1985 and 2011 is now soundtracked by UK drill, a rap subgenre that found its way to the country from the South Side of Chicago, with MCs riding like dirt bikes over revving, lurching bass to punctuate sometimes bleak accounts of life on the roads.\n\nHeadie One, AKA 25-year-old Irving Adjei, is the scene\u2019s biggest star and Tottenham\u2019s current golden child. In recent years, he has had Top 10 hits with Stormzy and Dave, and currently sits at No 9 on a track with the Canadian rap giant Drake, who has described Headie as \u201cthe best drill artist in the world\u201d. He has also just served a six-month jail term for carrying a knife. His music details the turbulent reality that confronts some of the young rappers coming out of Britain\u2019s inner cities. Hustle and hunger are baked into his stories, captivating a generation currently growing up in UK rap\u2019s golden age.\n\nOn Broadwater Farm, the Tottenham estate where Adjei was raised, he says:, \u201cEveryone was extremely motivated to get out, whatever way they can.\u201d We are sitting across from one another at a table in the basement of an east London studio. \u201cYou could see that growing up, even though it was family orientated, there was loads of negative stuff going on,\u201d he says. In an early freestyle, shot against a backdrop of Broadwater\u2019s looming towers when Headie was still a teenager, he raps: \u201cDo what comes to mind first, fuck karma.\u201d This restless streak would ultimately push him towards crime.\n\nTottenham sits at the heart of Haringey, one of London\u2019s most deprived boroughs. . Adjei\u2019s music reflects his environment, vividly relaying the bleak experiences of coastal and county drug lines, and brutal street skirmishes. Prison was the inevitable fallout from such extreme encounters. \u201cA lot of the time people don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re getting into,\u201d he says of life on the roads. There is a reserve in his manner, a quiet in his voice. As he speaks, his eyes shift around the room. \u201cIt happens so fast. We\u2019re young; we don\u2019t really know what we\u2019re doing. So when it does hit the fan and you\u2019re in real life-changing situations, you start to double-think: was this worth it?\u201d\n\nThe prison system is constantly referenced throughout Adjei\u2019s catalogue, a consequence of spells of incarceration since the age of 17, following convictions for drug and knife possession. In 2014, he was sentenced to 30 months after being caught with nearly \u00a330,000-worth of heroin and cocaine at Aberdeen railway station. The prison portraits brought to the surface in his music are sharp: memories of scrambling eggs in kettles and the rancid smell of mops and buckets. Tap water tinted orange, partners crying in visit halls and periods spent on \u201cbasic regime\u201d as a punishment for bad behaviour, with freedoms withered to near nothing. \u201cWhen you\u2019re put on basic, everything is taken away,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s not taken away from you is yourself. It\u2019s designed to break you down and to punish you.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Headie One at Brixton Academy, London, in\n\nNovember 2019. Photograph: Ollie Millington/Redferns\n\nDuring his bleakest moments, Adjei read books about the new age philosophical concept of the \u201claw of attraction\u201d, which asserts that positive experiences are drawn to an individual by a positive outlook. He says this brought hope into \u201ca situation where a normal person would see it as \u2018over, it\u2019s done, you\u2019re going to finish me off for ever\u2019\u201d. He freestyled to pass the time, a tingling sensation settling over him whenever he fed music through his ears, making him realise that other people inside \u201cdidn\u2019t feel the music like I did. Not just lyrics or beats, but the emotions, the sounds, the concepts.\u201d\n\nOn his first day out of prison in 2017, he recorded a song, filmed the video that afternoon and released it the following day. Rap was now more than a distraction: it could mean salvation. His work rate was frantic; it needed to be to turn his fortunes. \u201cI felt like I was behind in vital years,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are the years when people really start to figure out what they want to do. But I was stuck in the same place \u2013 it was frustrating. That\u2019s why I was doing everything triple speed.\u201d\n\nThree years later, the urge to reclaim those lost years has led to six mixtapes. And there is an acceptance now about his stretches inside: time away gave him perspective on the years that it also stole.\n\nEarly releases Drillers x Trappers, The One and The One Two used acoustics typical of a UK drill scene that was coming into its own, the grumbling 808s and gothic percussions a menacing underlay for Adjei\u2019s frank street diaries: peeks into a concealed Britain. Some songs were menacing, such as Know Better, which came in the aftermath of an attack made on him in 2018. But the music has evolved as he has grown, with melody blossoming. Auto-Tune melts his buttery voice on last year\u2019s Music x Road, which reached No 5 and become the highest-charting drill album ever; at his headline Brixton Academy concert, he took to the stage with a choir. His most recent release, Gang, made with producer Fred Again, went further, a near total departure from drill that pulled in electronic and ambient influences, and features FKA twigs and Jamie xx. \u201cI stopped trying to separate all music and just saw it as music,\u201d he says. \u201cI started to realise that music is a language: you have to listen to it and speak back.\u201d\n\nGang is closed out by Soldiers, a sombre yet defiant track with grieving piano keys and a blue Sampha hook. \u201cReminiscing about the roads with your flannel, Radox,\u201d he raps, alluding to illegal days spent out of town with little but a washbag by his side, \u201cnow you start to wish you packed it in and got a day job.\u201d\n\nRappers do not outrun their pasts, but live with them. Last June, Adjei\u2019s car was stopped and searched by police, who uncovered a lock knife. He was granted bail, and spent the summer gracing stages at Wireless and Glastonbury with the possibility of another prison sentence hanging over him. It is a fallout common to UK rappers who have gone quickly from road life to national fame; J Hus and Loski have also been separately charged for carrying weapons. The new money and celebrity can be a foul mix with the lifestyles and associations that came before. \u201cIt can go wrong, very easy,\u201d Adjei says. \u201cThere\u2019s been times for me when it\u2019s nearly gone wrong, multiple times where I wouldn\u2019t have been talking to you now. When you\u2019re coming from a life where negative things are happening, people ain\u2019t used to you getting into certain positions. That\u2019s when jealousy comes in, hate comes in. People want to get you out of that position. They don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re there and they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nPeople ain\u2019t used to you getting into certain positions. That\u2019s when jealousy comes in, hate comes in\n\nThere is no handbook on how to drop one life and pick up another \u2013 the transition is a fumble in the dark, an uncertain stagger between old habits and new realities. \u201cIt\u2019s a thin line, and you have to decide how you\u2019re going to deal with things,\u201d he continues. \u201cAre you going to deal with things like someone on this side of the line? Or are you going to deal with things like someone on this side? This side can bring you back to what\u2019s negative. But dealing with things on this side? You\u2019re not used to that. That was the time that I was in at that moment,\u201d he says, referring to when he was found with a knife. \u201cI was trying to work it out.\u201d\n\nAdjei was sentenced in early January, three weeks after his stellar showing on Stormzy\u2019s album Heavy is the Head. Prison was \u201clike going back in time,\u201d he says. \u201cThose kind of situations was my normality years ago. It was a wakeup call that it really is a thin line \u2013 one wrong move and it\u2019s all over, it\u2019s back to what you used to dream to get out of.\u201d\n\nHis sentence passed while the world withdrew into lockdown. After four months inside, he left prison in a helicopter, roving over country fields and a concrete London skyline. Just as in 2017, music soon followed. First there was Rose Gold, a trap-tinged reflection on Tottenham days gone by and gold-plated jewellery. Weeks later came the Only You Freestyle with Drake. Adjei wades in after Drake\u2019s first half with a flow as nimble as the footballers he references; he mourns for a friend serving 20 years in prison and looks back on years spent outside the law.\n\nThe verse encapsulates the pendulum of his life: the Tottenham boy who swung back from the brink. \u201cSwear I\u2019ve seen life from both perspectives,\u201d he raps, finally steadied.\n\n\u2022 Only You Freestyle is out now on Relentless Records", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/31/headie-one-in-prison-the-only-thing-not-taken-away-from-you-is-yourself", "author": ["Aniefiok Ekpoudom"]}, {"title": "'I ran out of excuses': lockdown raises the bar for UK ultrarunners", "text": "As rest of UK slowed down, serious runners used the time to train harder and smash records\n\nWhile many of us spent a lot of time doing very little during the coronavirus lockdown, for a niche pocket of society it provided an opportunity to push themselves to the limits of physical endurance.\n\nWhile ultrarunners also had less to do, with no races to train for, lockdown became an ideal opportunity to complete goals they had long hankered after, resulting in a number of world records being broken in the past few weeks alone.\n\nSabrina Verjee became the first woman to run the Wainwrights round, a mere 318 miles (512km), while Kim Collison broke the Lakes 24-hour challenge record that had stood for 23 years. Then came Beth Pascall, who smashed the previous Bob Graham record held by Jasmin Paris. Meanwhile, Damian Hall set a new record time on the 268-mile Pennine Way \u2013 while also cleaning the trail of litter \u2013 and earlier this week, Carla Molinaro set a new women\u2019s world record by running from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019 Groats in 12 days, 30 minutes and 14 seconds.\n\nMolinaro and Hall say the pandemic and subsequent lockdown gave them the impetus to finally complete goals that had been on their bucket lists for years.\n\nMolinaro, 36, a running coach, started out at Land\u2019s End at 5am on 16 July. Running nearly 73 miles every day and fuelled by macaroni cheese, cakes, some cocktail sausages and a few pitstops at B&Bs, she didn\u2019t even take a break to celebrate her 36th birthday.\n\n'It is part of my spiritual life': the people who take running to the extreme Read more\n\n\u201cThe weather was brutal towards the end \u2013 30mph winds and driving rain,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I couldn\u2019t run on the last day because I was in so much pain and we had to walk the last bit, but we somehow got through it,\u201d she said, as she was being driven back home to Buckinghamshire by her sister, Andrea, after completing the challenge.\n\nDespite getting blisters and having to have her toenails drilled, Molinaro, whose parents were marathon runners, took more than 10 hours off the previous record of 12 days, 11 hours and 6 minutes, set by the North Yorkshire runner Sharon Gayter last August.\n\nMolinaro, who represented Great Britain at the 100km World Championships and whose previous challenges include running 170km around Mont Blanc, began training for the feat on the driveway of her family home in South Africa.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018This ended up being one of the hardest things I have ever done\u2019 ... Carla Molinaro Photograph: Andrea Molinaro\n\n\u201cRight at the beginning I was stuck in South Africa and we weren\u2019t allowed to go out anywhere so I just started to do laps of the driveway \u2013 the neighbours thought I was mad,\u201d said the former British Army operations officer.\n\n\u201cBut all races were cancelled and the pressure of training for them had been suddenly taken away. It gave me that time to do those things which had been on my bucket list for a while, but this ended up being one of the hardest things I have ever done.\u201d\n\nMolinaro, whose inspiration included the endurance athlete Mimi Anderson, a previous record holder of the challenge, said it had been an \u201cawesome\u201d year for ultrarunners.\n\n\u201cFunny, really, that we clearly all had the same thought process. And then we all made it happen and went for the records at the same time. We smashed it and didn\u2019t just give up and sit on the couch, which was obviously tempting.\u201d\n\nHall agrees with Molinaro. The 44-year-old completed the Pennine Way in 61 hours 34 minutes, knocking more than three hours off the record set by his friend, the US ultrarunner John Kelly, just a week earlier. Before that, it had stood unbeaten for 31 years, belonging to Mike Hartley.\n\n\u201cThis had been on the radar for me for about four years but I\u2019d always been intimidated by how good the previous record was so I kept making excuses, but then lockdown happened and I ran out of excuses,\u201d says Hall.\n\nThe father-of-two from Wiltshire completed the record run at 7.34pm on Friday in Edale, Derbyshire, having started at 6am on Wednesday in Kirk Yetholm, Scottish Borders. His route along Great Britain\u2019s oldest national trail amassed more ascent than Mount Everest and included a section along Hadrian\u2019s Wall.\n\nThe climate-change campaigner, whose whole attempt was certified as \u201ccarbon negative\u201d by Our Carbon, used the challenge to help raise funds for Greenpeace UK. He and his 11 teams of pacers also cleaned the famous trail of litter as they ran, stuffing it in their packs before handing it to support team members at road crossing meet-up points.\n\n\u201cI feel tired and satisfied,\u201d says Hall, who headed straight to the pub for his first pint in four months after completing the challenge. \u201cLockdown gave me the opportunity to start enjoying running for the sake of running again.

In a eulogy at his memorial on Thursday, Barack Obama spoke about Lewis\u2019s legacy, especially the importance of continuing his fight to protect voting rights. This is an abridged version of his remarks.\n\nJames wrote to the believers: \u201cConsider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.\u201d\n\nIt is a great honor to be back in Ebenezer Baptist church, in the pulpit of its greatest pastor, Dr Martin Luther King Jr, to pay my respects to perhaps his finest disciple \u2013 an American whose faith was tested again and again to produce a man of pure joy and unbreakable perseverance \u2013 John Robert Lewis.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve come here today because I, like so many Americans, owe a great debt to John Lewis and his forceful vision of freedom.\n\nNow, this country is a constant work in progress. We were born with instructions: to form a more perfect union. Explicit in those words is the idea that we are imperfect; that what gives each new generation purpose is to take up the unfinished work of the last and carry it further than anyone might have thought possible.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Lewis arrives to speak to the crowd at the Edmund Pettus Bridge crossing reenactment marking the 55th anniversary of Selma\u2019s Bloody Sunday on 1 March 2020 in Selma, Alabama. Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nJohn Lewis \u2013 the first of the Freedom Riders, head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, youngest speaker at the March on Washington, leader of the march from Selma to Montgomery, member of Congress representing the people of this state and this district for 33 years, mentor to young people, including me at the time, until his final day on this Earth \u2013 he not only embraced that responsibility, but he made it his life\u2019s work.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t bad for a boy from Troy. John was born into modest means \u2013 that means he was poor \u2013 in the heart of the Jim Crow south to parents who picked somebody else\u2019s cotton. Apparently, he didn\u2019t take to farm work \u2013 on days when he was supposed to help his brothers and sisters with their labor, he\u2019d hide under the porch and make a break for the school bus when it showed up. His mother, Willie Mae Lewis, nurtured that curiosity in this shy, serious child. \u201cOnce you learn something,\u201d she told her son, \u201conce you get something inside your head, no one can take it away from you.\u201d\n\nAs a boy, John listened through the door after bedtime as his father\u2019s friends complained about the Klan. One Sunday as a teenager, he heard Dr King preach on the radio. As a college student in Tennessee, he signed up for Jim Lawson\u2019s workshops on the tactic of nonviolent civil disobedience. John Lewis was getting something inside his head, an idea he couldn\u2019t shake that took hold of him \u2013 that nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience were the means to change laws, but also change hearts, and change minds, and change nations, and change the world.\n\nObama hails John Lewis as founding father of \u2018fuller, better\u2019 US in eulogy Read more\n\nSo he helped organize the Nashville campaign in 1960. He and other young men and women sat at a segregated lunch counter, well-dressed, straight-backed, refusing to let a milkshake poured on their heads, or a cigarette extinguished on their backs, or a foot aimed at their ribs, refused to let that dent their dignity and their sense of purpose. And after a few months, the Nashville campaign achieved the first successful desegregation of public facilities in any major city in the south.\n\nJohn got a taste of jail for the first, second, third \u2026 well, several times. But he also got a taste of victory. And it consumed him with righteous purpose. And he took the battle deeper into the south.\n\nJohn was only 20 years old. But he pushed all 20 of those years to the center of the table, betting everything that his example could challenge centuries of convention\n\nThat same year, just weeks after the supreme court ruled that segregation of interstate bus facilities was unconstitutional, John and Bernard Lafayette bought two tickets, climbed aboard a Greyhound, sat up front, and refused to move. This was months before the first official Freedom Rides. He was doing a test. The trip was unsanctioned. Few knew what they were up to. And at every stop, through the night, apparently the angry driver stormed out of the bus and into the bus station. And John and Bernard had no idea what he might come back with or who he might come back with. Nobody was there to protect them. There were no camera crews to record events. You know, sometimes, we read about this and kind of take it for granted. Or at least we act as if it was inevitable. Imagine the courage of two people Malia\u2019s age, younger than my oldest daughter, on their own, to challenge an entire infrastructure of oppression.\n\nJohn was only 20 years old. But he pushed all 20 of those years to the center of the table, betting everything, all of it, that his example could challenge centuries of convention, and generations of brutal violence, and countless daily indignities suffered by African Americans.\n\nLike John the Baptist preparing the way, like those Old Testament prophets speaking truth to kings, John Lewis did not hesitate \u2013 he kept on getting onboard buses and sitting at lunch counters, got his mugshot taken again and again, marched again and again on a mission to change America.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A news conference in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1961.

He was warned that Governor Wallace had ordered troopers to use violence. But he and Hosea Williams and others led them across that bridge anyway. And we\u2019ve all seen the film and the footage and the photographs, and President Clinton mentioned the trench coat, the knapsack, the book to read, the apple to eat, the toothbrush \u2013 apparently jails weren\u2019t big on such creature comforts. And you look at those pictures and John looks so young and he\u2019s small in stature. Looking every bit that shy, serious child that his mother had raised and yet, he is full of purpose. God\u2019s put perseverance in him.\n\nAnd we know what happened to the marchers that day. Their bones were cracked by billy clubs, their eyes and lungs choked with teargas. As they knelt to pray, which made their heads even easier targets, and John was struck in the skull. And he thought he was going to die, surrounded by the sight of young Americans gagging, and bleeding, and trampled, victims in their own country of state-sponsored violence.\n\nAnd the thing is, I imagine initially that day, the troopers thought that they had won the battle. You can imagine the conversations they had afterwards. You can imagine them saying: \u201cYeah, we showed them.\u201d They figured they\u2019d turned the protesters back over the bridge; that they\u2019d kept, that they\u2019d preserved a system that denied the basic humanity of their fellow citizens. Except this time, there were some cameras there. This time, the world saw what happened, bore witness to Black Americans who were asking for nothing more than to be treated like other Americans. Who were not asking for special treatment, just the equal treatment promised to them a century before, and almost another century before that.\n\nWhen John woke up, and checked himself out of the hospital, he would make sure the world saw a movement that was, in the words of Scripture, \u201chard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed\u201d. They returned to Brown chapel, a battered prophet, bandages around his head, and he said more marchers will come now. And the people came. And the troopers parted. And the marchers reached Montgomery. And their words reached the White House \u2013 and Lyndon Johnson, son of the south, said \u201cWe shall overcome\u201d, and the Voting Rights Act was signed into law.\n\nThe life of John Lewis was, in so many ways, exceptional. It vindicated the faith in our founding, redeemed that faith; that most American of ideas; that idea that any of us ordinary people without rank or wealth or title or fame can somehow point out the imperfections of this nation, and come together, and challenge the status quo, and decide that it is in our power to remake this country that we love until it more closely aligns with our highest ideals. What a radical ideal. What a revolutionary notion. This idea that any of us, ordinary people, a young kid from Troy can stand up to the powers and principalities and say no this isn\u2019t right, this isn\u2019t true, this isn\u2019t just. We can do better. On the battlefield of justice, Americans like John, Americans like the Reverends Lowery and CT Vivian, two other patriots that we lost this year, liberated all of us that many Americans came to take for granted.\n\nAmerica was built by people like them. America was built by John Lewises. He as much as anyone in our history brought this country a little bit closer to our highest ideals. And someday, when we do finish that long journey toward freedom; when we do form a more perfect union \u2013 whether it\u2019s years from now, or decades, or even if it takes another two centuries \u2013 John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America.\n\nHe believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage, that in all of us there is a longing to do what\u2019s right\n\nAnd yet, as exceptional as John was, here\u2019s the thing: John never believed that what he did was more than any citizen of this country can do. I mentioned in the statement the day John passed, the thing about John was just how gentle and humble he was. And despite this storied, remarkable career, he treated everyone with kindness and respect because it was innate to him \u2013 this idea that any of us can do what he did if we are willing to persevere.\n\nHe believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage, that in all of us there is a longing to do what\u2019s right, that in all of us there is a willingness to love all people, and to extend to them their God-given rights to dignity and respect. So many of us lose that sense. It\u2019s taught out of us. We start feeling as if, in fact, that we can\u2019t afford to extend kindness or decency to other people. That we\u2019re better off if we are above other people and looking down on them, and so often that\u2019s encouraged in our culture. But John always saw the best in us. And he never gave up, and never stopped speaking out because he saw the best in us. He believed in us even when we didn\u2019t believe in ourselves. As a congressman, he didn\u2019t rest; he kept getting himself arrested. As an old man, he didn\u2019t sit out any fight; he sat in, all night long, on the floor of the United States Capitol. I know his staff was stressed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Lewis and other members of Congress staging a sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives in 2016, demanding that the Republican-led body vote on gun-control legislation following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Photograph: Handout/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut the testing of his faith produced perseverance. He knew that the march is not yet over, that the race is not yet won, that we have not yet reached that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character. He knew from his own life that progress is fragile; that we have to be vigilant against the darker currents of this country\u2019s history, of our own history, with their whirlpools of violence and hatred and despair that can always rise again.\n\nBull Connor may be gone. But today we witness with our own eyes police officers kneeling on the necks of Black Americans. George Wallace may be gone. But we can witness our federal government sending agents to use teargas and batons against peaceful demonstrators. We may no longer have to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar in order to cast a ballot. But even as we sit here, there are those in power are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting \u2013 by closing polling locations, and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the postal service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mailed-in ballots so people don\u2019t get sick.\n\nJohn Lewis knew civil rights did not end with voting rights or Barack Obama | Peniel E Joseph Read more\n\nNow, I know this is a celebration of John\u2019s life. There are some who might say we shouldn\u2019t dwell on such things. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m talking about it. John Lewis devoted his time on this Earth fighting the very attacks on democracy and what\u2019s best in America that we are seeing circulate right now.\n\nHe knew that every single one of us has a God-given power. And that the fate of this democracy depends on how we use it; that democracy isn\u2019t automatic, it has to be nurtured, it has to be tended to, we have to work at it, it\u2019s hard. And so he knew it depends on whether we summon a measure, just a measure, of John\u2019s moral courage to question what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong and call things as they are. He said that as long as he had breath in his body, he would do everything he could to preserve this democracy. That as long as we have breath in our bodies, we have to continue his cause. If we want our children to grow up in a democracy \u2013 not just with elections, but a true democracy, a representative democracy, a big-hearted, tolerant, vibrant, inclusive America of perpetual self-creation \u2013 then we are going to have to be more like John. We don\u2019t have to do all the things he had to do because he did them for us. But we have got to do something. As the Lord instructed Paul: \u201cDo not be afraid, go on speaking; do not be silent, for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people.\u201d Just everybody\u2019s just got to come out and vote. We\u2019ve got all those people in the city but we can\u2019t do nothing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kelli McLester poses in front of a poster outside of the South View Cemetery where John Lewis is being buried in a private ceremony on Thursday in Atlanta, Georgia. Photograph: Jessica McGowan/Getty Images\n\nLike John, we have got to keep getting into that good trouble. He knew that nonviolent protest is patriotic: a way to raise public awareness, put a spotlight on injustice, and make the powers that be uncomfortable.\n\nLike John, we don\u2019t have to choose between protest and politics. It is not an either-or situation, it is a both-and situation. We have to engage in protests where that is effective but we also have to translate our passion and our causes into laws and institutional practices. That\u2019s why John ran for Congress thirty-four years ago.\n\nLike John, we have got to fight even harder for the most powerful tool we have, which is the right to vote. The Voting Rights Act is one of the crowning achievements of our democracy. It\u2019s why John crossed that bridge. It\u2019s why he spilled his blood. And by the way, it was the result of Democratic and Republican efforts. President Bush, who spoke here earlier, and his father both signed its renewal when they were in office. President Clinton didn\u2019t have to because it was the law when he arrived so instead he made a law that made it easier for people to register to vote.\n\nBut once the supreme court weakened the Voting Rights Act, some state legislatures unleashed a flood of laws designed specifically to make voting harder, especially, by the way, state legislatures where there is a lot of minority turnout and population growth. That\u2019s not necessarily a mystery or an accident. It was an attack on what John fought for. It was an attack on our democratic freedoms. And we should treat it as such.\n\nYou want to honor John? Let\u2019s honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for\n\nIf politicians want to honor John, and I\u2019m so grateful for the legacy of work of all the congressional leaders who are here, but there\u2019s a better way than a statement calling him a hero. You want to honor John? Let\u2019s honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for. And by the way, naming it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, that is a fine tribute. But John wouldn\u2019t want us to stop there, trying to get back to where we already were. Once we pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, we should keep marching to make it even better.\n\nBy making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including former inmates who\u2019ve earned their second chance.\n\nBy adding polling places, and expanding early voting, and making election day a national holiday, so if you are someone who is working in a factory, or you are a single mom who has got to go to her job and doesn\u2019t get time off, you can still cast your ballot.\n\nBy guaranteeing that every American citizen has equal representation in our government, including the American citizens who live in Washington DC and in Puerto Rico. They are Americans.\n\nBy ending some of the partisan gerrymandering\u2013 so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians, not the other way around.\n\nAnd if all this takes eliminating the filibuster \u2013 another Jim Crow relic \u2013 in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that\u2019s what we should do.\n\nAnd yet, even if we do all this \u2013 even if every bogus voter suppression law was struck off the books today \u2013 we have got to be honest with ourselves that too many of us choose not to exercise the franchise; that too many of our citizens believe their vote won\u2019t make a difference, or they buy into the cynicism that, by the way, is the central strategy of voter suppression \u2013 to make you discouraged, to stop believing in your own power.\n\nSo we are also going to have to remember what John said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t do everything you can to change things, then they will remain the same. You only pass this way once. You have to give it all you have.\u201d As long as young people are protesting in the streets, hoping real change takes hold, I\u2019m hopeful but we cannot casually abandon them at the ballot box. Not when few elections have been as urgent, on so many levels, as this one. We cannot treat voting as an errand to run if we have some time. We have to treat it as the most important action we can take on behalf of democracy.\n\nLike John, we have to give it all we have.\n\nI was proud that John Lewis was a friend of mine. I met him when I was in law school. He came to speak and I went up and I said: \u201cMr Lewis, you are one of my heroes. What inspired me more than anything as a young man was to see what you and Reverend Lawson and Bob Moses and Diane Nash and others did.\u201d And he got that kind of \u2013 \u201caw shucks, thank you very much\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s where real courage comes from. Not from turning on each other, but by turning towards one another\n\nThe next time I saw him, I had been elected to the United States Senate. And I told him, \u201cJohn, I am here because of you.\u201d On inauguration day in 2009, he was one of the first people that I greeted and hugged on that stand. I told him, \u201cThis is your day too.\u201d\n\nHe was a good and kind and gentle man. And he believed in us \u2013 even when we don\u2019t believe in ourselves. It\u2019s fitting that the last time John and I shared a public forum was on Zoom. I am pretty sure that neither he nor I set up the Zoom call because we didn\u2019t know how to work it. It was a virtual town hall with a gathering of young activists who had been helping to lead this summer\u2019s demonstrations in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death. And afterwards, I spoke to John privately, and he could not have been prouder to see this new generation of activists standing up for freedom and equality; a new generation that was intent on voting and protecting the right to vote; in some cases, a new generation running for political office.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barack Obama, center, walks as he holds hands with Amelia Boynton Robinson and John Lewis as they walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, for the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, in 2015.

They learned from your example, even if they didn\u2019t always know it. They had understood, through him, what American citizenship requires, even if they had only heard about his courage through the history books.\n\n\u201cBy the thousands, faceless, anonymous, relentless young people, black and white\u2026have taken our whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in the formulation of the constitution and the Declaration of Independence.\u201d\n\nDr King said that in the 1960s. And it came true again this summer.\n\n\n\nWe see it outside our windows, in big cities and rural towns, in men and women, young and old, straight Americans and LGBTQ Americans, Blacks who long for equal treatment and whites who can no longer accept freedom for themselves while witnessing the subjugation of their fellow Americans. We see it in everybody doing the hard work of overcoming complacency, of overcoming our own fears and our own prejudices, our own hatreds. You see it in people trying to be better, truer versions of ourselves.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what John Lewis teaches us. That\u2019s where real courage comes from. Not from turning on each other, but by turning towards one another. Not by sowing hatred and division, but by spreading love and truth. Not by avoiding our responsibilities to create a better America and a better world, but by embracing those responsibilities with joy and perseverance and discovering that in our beloved community, we do not walk alone.\n\nWhat a gift John Lewis was. We are all so lucky to have had him walk with us for a while, and show us the way.\n\nGod bless you all. God bless America.

I was the first to have hairy arms, hands and feet \u2013 aged 12 or so. Before long, a sweater blossomed on my torso and along with it, came the name-calling: Frodo, caveman, mop-head. Moms pulled at it uninvited, a couple of my high school crushes tousled it (which I liked) \u2013 I took out more than a few paper balls that had been spit into it without my noticing. Par for the coarse haired, I supposed.\n\nThen, as a teen in a suburb of superficial Miami, I discovered rock and roll and its counterculture. While all of my friends were getting drunk listening to electronic chart hits in clubs, I defined myself in opposition to them: I grew my hair long and wore it messy \u2013 it became a staunch personal symbol for my reluctance to comply.\n\nAt work, I was often told I should cut it \u2013 always by older and more experienced colleagues \u2013 usually when I asked for career advice. My quick solution was to tie it up in a bun, but the comments only reinforced my desire to wear my thick, beehive of hair like a badge of honor.\n\nI was annoyed that bosses were more invested in my image than my skills or work ethic. It might seem like self sabotage, but for me it was about control: I was not going to spend time trying to impress people who disliked me for something I never did wrong.\n\nI realized what I once thought was non-conformity was in fact a cover for vanity; I was scared to be bald.\n\nThen, last year, after five years dodging the barber shop, a practical consideration came up: my 16in long hair was starting to harm my scalp. It was unruly, impossible to comb; and had begun thinning at the top, receding at the temples. I struggled over whether to cut it or not. My hair had become such a part of my rebellious identity, I found it hard to think about letting go. But eventually I realized that what I once thought was non-conformity was in fact a cover for vanity; I was scared to be bald.\n\nMy year-long deliberations were finally cut short by an impromptu decision one day after a soccer match when \u2013 just before shutdown orders descended upon New York \u2013 a close friend suggested we shave the whole thing off. Walking off the pitch in our muddy sweaters towards my new uncertain fate I felt a weird sense of excitement.\n\nWe sat in his bathroom, in a Brooklyn hipster house full of men and the clippers buzzed. Niche Peruvian football players watched me from their positions on damp, curling posters on the wall. It was dim and dirty, the mirror was small. My big life change, in the most unceremonious of settings.\n\nHe took the clippers to my man-bun. There was so much we had to go at it in multiple bouts. We laughed the whole time. How did I let my hair get this bad for such a non-reason? It was pleasant, a moment of bonding. I was free.\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t have been better. Immediately after I shaved my head, the shutdown order in New York closed offices like mine for the foreseeable future. Without eyes watching on the morning commute or the stares of people in bars or friends at work, I could relax into my haircut. I had no hair, but somehow, I was still the same person.\n\nLooking back, I realize that growing my hair had been freeing for a while, but also limiting. I defined myself in opposition to others, always. I so resented their expectations that I built my identity around not being like them.

Some waved the Chinese flag while others set off fireworks. In one video, a woman said she was \u201cextremely happy\u201d to see the consulate close. \u201cWe have kicked out one more hub for spies!\u201d she said, smiling as she pointed at the building.\n\nIn another video, widely circulated on Chinese social media, a CNN reporter attempting to broadcast is drowned out by a group belting out a patriotic Chinese song.

Crying and pelting the building with eggs, stones, and any other objects they could find, demonstrators were angry at the US but also frustrated at how little their government could do to retaliate.\n\nAlarm over discovery of hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels near Gal\u00e1pagos Islands Read more\n\n\u201cOur country is not like before. We can do more than just make statements, we can actually take action,\u201d says Wu, 25, who lives in Chengdu and visited the consulate on its last day on Monday, snapping a few photos to keep. \u201cBack then China couldn\u2019t afford to offend the US, but China is powerful now and not afraid of American imperialism.\u201d\n\nAs China finds itself under attack abroad as a result of its increasingly aggressive global stance, nationalist sentiment at home appears to be growing stronger. Officials have honed support with the usual tools of propaganda and patriotic education, as well as new tactics, such as \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy, characterised by aggressive attacks on the country\u2019s foreign critics.\n\nYet, cultivating a sense of nationalism that puts China increasingly at odds with much of the western world, also threatens to make current frictions more intractable, driving it closer to conflict with countries such as the US, its main rival. Beijing is locked in disputes with the UK, Australia and Canada over issues from Huawei to Hong Kong, and has blamed the US for those tensions.\n\n\u201cOn both sides, the nationalist sentiment is stronger than ever before. There is no doubt that antagonistic nationalism has dramatically increased to a level that many have never seen,\u201d says Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations and director of the centre on American studies at Renmin University of China. \u201cThis may mean the government policies will become more antagonist towards each other.\u201d\n\nNationalism has long been a double-edged sword for the Chinese leadership \u2013 useful to bolster the ruling party\u2019s standing but dangerous when emotions run too high. Anti-Japanese protests over a territorial dispute in 2012 turned into a riot, with residents in Shenzhen flipping and smashing Japanese cars. An editorial in the state-run China Daily at the time said: \u201cThis type of \u2018patriotism\u2019 will never receive applause.\u201d\n\nWhy is Xi Jinping pitting China against the world?

Meanwhile, they have further narrowed the space for public discussion with more censorship and regulation of the internet, including detaining users.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government has increasingly leaned on nationalist rhetoric to justify its rule, while also keeping grassroots nationalism on a much tighter leash,\u201d says Jessica Chen Weiss, associate professor of government at Cornell University and author of the book, Powerful Patriots: Nationalist Protest in China\u2019s Foreign Relations.\n\n\u201cTo some extent, the government has been able to use tough talk and bluster to appease domestic audiences, but swagger has real downsides for China\u2019s foreign policy objectives.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pro-China activists step on photographs of Donald Trump and secretary of state Mike Pompeo outside the US Consulate in Hong Kong.

So they are louder and recently, they are becoming more and more extreme,\u201d he says.\n\nAs someone who depends on access to the US and other countries for his work, he has watched the deteriorating relationship with the US with dismay. He believes that many, like him, are worried and do not want to see their country so combative.\n\n\u201cWe are really despairing because we can\u2019t express our views. It\u2019s like we are on a train that has lost control and there is nothing we can do but let it barrel forward,\u201d he says.\n\nStill, Chinese leaders may also not wish to see things out of control. Chinese state media have kept a close lid on topics such as a recent border clash with India, an incident that could easily have caused a wave of national anger. Chinese officials, while loudly condemning the US for ordering the Chinese consulate in Houston to close, have limited threats to promising an \u201cequal response\u201d to US actions.\n\n\u201cChinese authorities were quick to clamp down on any sign of protest outside the US consulate in Chengdu, reflecting Beijing\u2019s apparent desire to retaliate in a way that shows resolve but does not accelerate the current death-spiral in US-China relations,\u201d says Weiss.\n\nAs the deadline for the Chengdu consulate\u2019s closure loomed on Monday, consulate staff rushed to clear the compound, including a garden planted by American and Chinese stuff. A banner with the words, \u201cThank you, Chengdu, 1985-2020\u201d was ordered. At dawn, the American flag was lowered for the last time.\n\nWu arrived that night, hours after the consulate was officially shut. It was late and the street, blocked off by police, was quiet but a crowd remained. Most were looking at the scene or taking photos.\n\nWu, who had come to \u201cwitness history\u201d, says there was still a feeling of unease about the closure. Born and raised in Chengdu, a place known for being laid-back and more open, he believes his city has always been friendly to foreigners.\n\n\u201cI think most people feel this is a little negative.

She didn\u2019t say when \u2013 but it was fine, she reassured listeners in a radio interview, because, as she recalled, \u201cat no point did I feel that they were going to kill me\u201d.\n\nBadenoch was responding to the case of 12-year-old Kai Agyepong, whose family were subjected to a terrifying armed raid after a passerby saw Kai playing \u2013 alone \u2013 with his plastic toy gun and informed the police. Kai\u2019s mother, Mina, said at least two dozen officers stormed her house, then detained and handcuffed the petrified child, having found no firearms, just the toy gun.\n\nThe presumption of innocence has always had racial caveats. This month, for example, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, claimed to have special insight into the criminality of stop and search victims \u2013 who are 10 times more likely to be black \u2013 even when, as is the case in the vast majority of searches, no evidence of wrongdoing is found.\n\n\u201cSome of them have stashed it, given it to the other boy or whatever. That\u2019s a proportion of those people. Because what I can tell you is, we\u2019re focused in the right areas and focusing hugely on people that we know to be involved in violent crime,\u201d said Dick.\n\nI have no idea how Dick could know what criminality people are involved in when no evidence is produced to support it. But I do know that the wholesale criminalisation of the black community is nothing new. It leads, at one end of the spectrum to children being harassed and psychologically broken by the constant suspicion that they \u2013 to use the police\u2019s phrase \u2013 \u201cfit the profile\u201d of someone who committed a crime. A whole new generation is bringing this trauma to their resurgent Black Lives Matter activism, as profiled in the Guardian\u2019s new special project, Young, British and Black, revealing the stories behind Britain\u2019s anti-racism protests.\n\nThey include Derrell Thomas , who was stopped by police and put in handcuffs while out walking with his mother. Like Kai Agyepong, he was 12 years old. Derrell\u2019s mother, Nia, described the experience as the loss of his innocence.\n\nFamily members of black police officers, such as Reuben Smith Anglin, 19, whose father is a former police officer and whose aunt is a detective sergeant, are in no way exempt from this torment. This is undoubtedly one of the reasons that black officers are notably more critical of stop and search than some of their white peers.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the normalisation of racist policing practices leads to the use of fatal force against black people who need help or protection from authorities, yet end up dead. Many of these harrowing stories are documented in 1500 & Counting, a film released online this week. When the writer and activist Siana Bangura and the director, Troy James, began making the film in 2015, that was the number of people who had died in police custody in England and Wales since 1990, according to a report by the charity Inquest. The proportion of deaths of people of colour in custody where use of force or restraint is a feature is over two times greater than for other groups. Now the total number has passed 1,740 for all deaths in police custody in England and Wales. 1500 & Counting was depressingly prophetic.\n\nBut the thing that floors you when watching the film is not numbers, but the details. I challenge you to forget a monologue by Janet Alder talking about how her brother Christopher \u2013 a former paratrooper \u2013 was assaulted outside a nightclub, yet treated as a suspect. CCTV footage showed police officers laughing and joking around him as his life drained away on the floor of a Hull police station.\n\nHaving persecuted Janet by putting her under surveillance, the wider criminal justice system had one final, despicable assault on Christopher\u2019s dignity - his body was swapped with that of a 77-year-old woman. For more than a decade the family believed they had buried him, only for his body to turn up in a mortuary 11 years later.\n\nI and so many others have written over the years about a litany of other cases in which black people have been treated with monstrous contempt. Victims are unlikely to be able to identify who exactly within the broader criminal justice system is responsible for these further wrongs. Take the family of Mzee Mohammed, only 18 when he died on the floor surrounded by police officers and security guards. They were given a decomposing body to bury.\n\nAnd what about Sarah Reed, whose story is hauntingly told in 1500 & Counting? She was a vulnerable woman who was assaulted by police in 2012. A few years later she was imprisoned, and went on to take her own life behind bars. In Scotland Sheku Bayoh, a gas engineer, was held face down by up to nine officers in Kirkcaldy, subjected to CS spray, pepper spray, batons, handcuffs and leg restraints, and had suffered 23 separate injuries by the time he finally died in their supposed care. His experience is chillingly recounted in the film.\n\nWho will hold the police to account? Not the criminal justice system, which has never convicted a single officer for murder or manslaughter, in spite of numerous critical inquest verdicts, reports, reviews and inquiries.\n\nNot this government. Badenoch may be presiding over yet another inequality inquiry, but in the same interview this week her emphasis was not on the scrutiny we so crucially need. Instead she sees her ministerial role as to \u201creassure people about policing in this country\u201d. Because everything is just dandy.\n\nNot the Labour party, it seems, which doesn\u2019t appear shocked by the fact that years of tough talk on policing has failed to prevent the rise in violent crime. When the shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, says he wants violent criminals to fear the police, the innocent black people so often presumed to be violent criminals are the ones who should be afraid.\n\nNot the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The current chair, David Isaac, is in the unenviable position of having to explain how it can pressure others into racial equality when it doesn\u2019t have a single black commissioner itself.

This has prolonged anger and resentment among the victims of an imperial adventure that continues to divide the two nations.\n\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, wants to change all this, and has appointed a renowned Paris university professor to shed light on \u201cthe memory of colonisation and the Algerian war\u201d by the end of this year. Benjamin Stora\u2019s ultimate objective will be to illuminate the horror of what went on during the 132 years of conquest that started in 1830, but also to help bring about \u201creconciliation between the French and Algerian peoples\u201d, reads a particularly ambitious \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace statement.\n\nMacron is the first French head of state to address this scandalously neglected issue since the country\u2019s defeat at the hands of Algerian nationalists in 1962, telling journalists on a trip back from Israel earlier this year: \u201cThe Algerian war is today absent from our political memory and the subject of a conflict of memories like the Holocaust was.\u201d He added, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about this. We crush it.\u201d\n\nHowever, Algerian communities in France, as well as in Algeria, are by no means convinced that rapprochement is so close at hand. This is because their collective memory is informed by the hardship that has persisted long after freedom.\n\nWhen victory was achieved after the nearly eight-year Algerian war of independence, the winning forces claimed some 1.5 million Algerians had been killed. The dead ranged from men, women and children obliterated by napalm or in caves used as improvised gas chambers to Algerian separatists drowned or clubbed to death by Paris police following round-ups in the French capital.\n\nThose responsible for such mass murders were always protected by their government, whose official death and wounded figures unsurprisingly never correlated with the ones produced by Algeria\u2019s FLN, National Liberation Front. Incredible as it might sound, the French did not even recognise the conflict as a war until 1999, when legislation ruled that it was finally time to get rid of the sinister euphemism \u201coperations to maintain order\u201d.\n\nFrench patriots point to the loss of their own soldiers and settler militias \u2013 some 28,000 dead, 75,000 injured and thousands more missing. The so-called Algerian harkis who fought for the republic \u2013 in many cases as cannon fodder \u2013 accounted for up to 150,000 casualties.\n\nUnlike British India, the jewel in the crown of the French empire was an actual part of France. Algeria had its own d\u00e9partements \u2013 the Gallic equivalent of counties \u2013 and its settler colonialists, the so-called Pieds-Noirs (\u201cblack feet\u201d), returned MPs to the National Assembly in Paris.\n\nLabourers from indigenous Arab Muslim communities were meanwhile imported to the mainland in their hundreds of thousands to help with the rebuilding of France, particularly after the second world war. They originally lived in shanty towns that developed into the decrepit housing estates where the vast majority of French-Algerians can still be found to this day. They continue to experience discrimination in every aspect of their lives, as well as police brutality.\n\nIn turn, the Pieds-Noirs nostalgia remains strong in the Rassemblement National (National Rally) \u2013 the far-right party founded as the Front National by Jean-Marie Le Pen, the convicted racist and Holocaust denier, who has been linked to acts of torture while serving as a soldier in Algeria. He denies all allegations of involvement in torture. Profound antipathy towards north Africans, and indeed Islam, is still a huge part of the movement\u2019s politics. Like so many others, they maintain a colonial view of dark-skinned Arab Muslims, who they do not consider as French.\n\nIn this sense, the Algeria question is about so much more than the war \u2013 it has come to define the nature of modern France, and particularly its prejudices and inequalities.\n\nMacron is an astute politician, and it could be argued that his attempt to resolve outstanding grievances simply represents electioneering, with the head of state hoping to win over French-Algerian voters before he runs for a second term in 2022.\n\nStora, his chosen historian, is a highly rated academic with an outstanding record of research into north African affairs, but he is based in France, and \u2013 just as significantly \u2013 is not an Algerian. On the contrary, he is from a Pieds-Noirs settler background. His birthplace is Constantine, near which some 45,000 Algerian civilians were massacred by the French during disturbances in May 1945.\n\nPredictably, the Algerian government has asked its own distinguished professor, Abdelmadjid Chikhi, the director general of the National Centre of Algerian Archives, to conduct a \u201ctruth inquiry\u201d \u2013 as it is described in Algiers \u2013 in parallel with Stora.\n\nHaving spoken to Macron about war and memory, I am convinced that he wants to make his mark on Franco-Algerian relations. Coming from the Somme region, he is acutely sensitive to how the world wars are constantly commemorated, but not colonial ones. Just before his election in 2017, Macron stated that there were \u201ccrimes and acts of barbarism\u201d in Algeria that would nowadays be prosecuted as \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d.\n\nThis in itself was a stark acknowledgment of the extent of the French savagery, suggesting that the next obvious step would be an apology and indeed reparations. Court convictions could certainly be achieved.\n\nFrance did not own up to its collaboration in the Holocaust until 1995, when then-president Jacques Chirac formally admitted and apologised for the role his countrymen had played in sending Jews to their deaths in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nMacron already has plenty of evidence highlighting the evil nature of l\u2019Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise. Academically rehearsing what we know won\u2019t achieve much. If anything, it could exacerbate grievances. What is needed are an apology, reparations and \u2013 yes \u2013 even prosecutions.\n\n\u2022 Nabila Ramdani is a Paris-born journalist and academic of Algerian descent\n\n\n\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/31/algeria-apology-reparations-france-history-emmanuel-macron", "author": ["Nabila Ramdani"]}, {"title": "Thanks to outsourcing, England's test and trace system is in chaos | Allyson Pollock", "text": "We all know that an effective and integrated find, test, track and trace system is hugely important in tackling the coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s crucial if we\u2019re going to come out of lockdown safely, prevent a second wave of suffering and see our loved ones again.\n\nYet Britain\u2019s test and trace programme \u2013 lauded by the government as \u201cworld-beating\u201d \u2013 is about as far from integrated or effective as you can get.\n\nThat\u2019s because a key part of it operates not as part of the NHS, but in parallel to it \u2013 as a network of commercial, privatised testing labs, drive-through centres and call centres. The chaos this has brought has resulted in huge gaps in information available to local services, causing delays in accessing results and hampering efforts to control the outbreak.\n\nInstead of putting local public health experts and NHS services in charge of contact tracing, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, handed over responsibility to private companies such as the outsourcing giant Serco, which has previously been fined for deaths of workers and members of the public that could have been prevented. The list of problems in the test and trace system is already immense \u2013 three data breaches, poor training and faulty online administration systems among them.\n\nDespite this convoluted mess of a setup, local health protection teams are delivering. In public hands, teams are tracing far more contacts than the privatised national call centres and online system. They are achieving this even in the face of local public health departments being hampered by lack of access to real-time data on cases in their communities. The health secretary needs to amend the current notification system urgently to ensure test results for all cases are sent to local public health departments and primary care within 24 hours. Lack of timely, detailed data on people testing positive for Covid-19, including postcodes, is currently hindering the work of local authorities and public health departments.\n\nThe government\u2019s own emergency science group, Sage, says the target to ensure the virus doesn\u2019t spread further is finding and reaching 80% of all close contacts of symptomatic cases. Yet in Blackburn, where health chiefs are battling a major outbreak, leaked analysis shows that the national tracing service is reaching only 52% of all close contacts.\n\nThis privatised system clearly isn\u2019t working \u2013 and even the government appears to recognise there are problems. It has appointed the management consultancy firm McKinsey to review the contact tracing service, following many media reports of the system not working well.\n\nYet despite all this, it still hasn\u2019t published the details of its contracts with the likes of Serco. According to the Treasury, \u00a310bn of public money has been allocated to England\u2019s test and trace programme. Only \u00a3300m of additional funding has been offered to local authorities to support the system.\n\nBillions of funding are unaccounted for. Some will be spent on contracts with Serco, Sitel and Capita, among others. Right now, we can\u2019t see how much they\u2019re being paid, for how long and for what. How are these contracts being monitored and by whom? What about subcontractors, and their contractual agreements?\n\nThe fact that this information is not readily available is an insult to those working night and day to stop the spread of this virus, and to our communities who worry night and day about loved ones.\n\nI\u2019ve joined more than 100 public figures \u2013 including academics, journalists and health professionals \u2013 in writing to Matt Hancock, demanding he publishes the contracts given to private companies as part of the test and trace system. We believe it is essential for the public and the wider health community \u2013 including the NHS and local government public health teams \u2013 to have a better understanding of these contracts.\n\nThat\u2019s the immediate priority \u2013 as an absolute minimum. But more broadly, the public knows this is not a good way to run contact tracing, and it is for all of these reasons that over two-thirds of those surveyed believe local public health teams and local health services should be in charge of the contact tracing system.\n\nThe Independent Sage group has already offered a solution that Hancock could take up easily. Put local authorities, local public health teams and local health services (including GPs and NHS laboratories) back in charge of testing and tracing in the community, and give them the resources to do this properly over the coming months and years. This is the system Wales and Scotland have opted for, as has Germany. That would be a test, track and trace programme the public could have faith in.\n\n\u2022 Allyson Pollock is professor of public health research and policy at Queen Mary University of London and author of NHS plc: the Privatisation of Our Health Care", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/31/outsourcing-england-test-trace-nhs-private", "author": ["Allyson Pollock"]}, {"title": "New Zealand's relationship with China is at a tipping point | Anne-Marie Brady", "text": "This week New Zealand announced it was suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong as a result of Hong Kong\u2019s new national security law. At the same time, NZ changed its policy on military and dual-use goods and technology exports to Hong Kong, subjecting the city to the same as the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The New Zealand government also issued a travel warning to New Zealanders on the risks of travelling to Hong Kong.\n\nIn a statement, Wellington said it \u201ccan no longer trust that Hong Kong\u2019s criminal justice system is sufficiently independent from China.\u201d No explanation was given for the suspension of sensitive technology exports.\n\nWith these three actions, NZ has clearly reached a tipping point in facing up to the risks and challenges of dealing with China in the Xi era. But will the government make more fundamental changes to protect New Zealand\u2019s interests?\n\n'I'm being watched': Anne-Marie Brady, the China critic living in fear of Beijing Read more\n\nChina\u2019s ambassador to New Zealand, Wu Xi, accused Wellington of \u201cgross interference in China\u2019s internal affairs\u201d but the coalition government\u2019s reaction was calm and measured. Unusually, in a show of unity, all three leaders of the Labour-NZ First-Greens coalition \u2013 Jacinda Ardern, Winston Peters and James Shaw \u2013 commented.\n\nThe main opposition party\u2019s spokesperson on foreign affairs, Simon Bridges, also made comments supportive of the government\u2019s position, as did the leader of ACT, David Seymour.\n\nIt is rare to see such unity in New Zealand politics and the parties appeared on the brink of forging a cross-party consensus on China.\n\nNew Zealand is now where Australia was three years ago, when it reached bipartisan consensus on China, after a devastating assessment of the extent of the Chinese Communist party\u2019s (CCP) political interference activities.\n\nLike Australia, New Zealand has had a bad case of CCP political interference. It has affected political parties, universities, central and local governments, and had a serious impact on the freedom of speech and association of the New Zealand Chinese population.\n\nMy report out this month \u2013 entitled Holding a Pen in One Hand, Gripping a Gun in the Other \u2013 found successive New Zealand governments had turned a blind eye to the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s efforts to access New Zealand\u2019s military technology and knowhow, which appear to be in breach of New Zealand\u2019s laws, international obligations \u2013 and national interest. China is the main source of state-sponsored cyber attacks on New Zealand.\n\nSince coming to power in October 2017, the Ardern government has steadily adjusted New Zealand\u2019s China policies, on a case-by-case basis, with the spy agency the Government Communications Security Bureau claiming its assessments were \u201ccountry agnostic\u201d. Beijing\u2019s actions in Xinjiang and Hong Kong have sped up the process of that readjustment.\n\nNew Zealand is now pulling together with other small and medium states to provide mutual economic, political, and strategic support to mitigate the China risk. China takes 30% of New Zealand\u2019s exports and New Zealand is dependent on China for a significant number of strategic imports.\n\nNew Zealand is close to signing a Digital Trade Agreement with the US, and free trade agreement talks with the UK are making good progress. Five Eyes partners are also discussing how they can better cooperate economically. The debate about whether to confront Xi Jinping\u2019s China has long been framed around the risk to New Zealand\u2019s economic security, rather than national security.\n\nThe coalition government has made a series of legislative changes to deal with CCP political interference in New Zealand, such as changing political donation rules and adding in national security considerations to overseas investment. Still more needs to be done.\n\nProminent New Zealand civil society leader Freeman Yu commented that the CCP-connected candidates selected by New Zealand political parties in the 2020 election \u201crepresents CCP Money, not me. Our NZ\u2019s democracy is serious sick.\u201d\n\nThe 230,000-strong New Zealand Chinese population is diverse, not all are from mainland China, and those who are, voted with their feet. New Zealand politicians need to show this population that they are interested in representing all of them, not just a wealthy minority connected to the CCP.\n\nNew Zealand also needs to address CCP interference activities in tertiary institutions, which is having a chilling effect on academic freedom. Fundamentally, New Zealand must engage in a thorough rethink of the NZ Inc China Strategy. Released in 2012, it is out-of-date, and unable to deal with China under Xi Jinping.\n\nIt is unlikely there will be major economic consequences for New Zealand suspending the extradition treaty with Hong Kong, or further resilience efforts. Beijing has made it very clear that the administration of Hong Kong is now being merged with China, breaking the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d agreement. Therefore it makes sense to suspend the treaty, as Hong Kong is no longer legally autonomous. New Zealand puts a high premium on the right to free speech and association. China cannot afford to punish governments for acting on their national laws and adopting their national values in their foreign policy.\n\nNew Zealand does not need to take three years to catch up with Australia, and we can learn from their missteps. New Zealand must forge a relationship with China that has good boundaries, and protects our national interests. Any short-term damage will be worth it for these long-term benefits.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/31/new-zealands-relationship-with-china-is-at-a-tipping-point", "author": ["Anne-Marie Brady"]}, {"title": "Australia's 'black summer' bushfires showed the impact of human-wrought change | Tim Flannery", "text": "Australia\u2019s \u201cblack summer\u201d megafires were a severe blow to ecosystems already reeling from decades of adverse impacts. Feral predators and grazers, weeds and unsustainable land and water use have reduced the resilience of nature in Australia. So when the unprecedented fires came, they were able to push species to the brink.\n\nWalking the fire grounds it was impossible to miss the immediate impacts: charred bodies of snakes lying among rocks, and dead wallabies floating in waterholes. But some astonishing survivors were also to be seen: small lizards that had waited it out in burrows, and birds that had fled to safety then returned. And with rain, the trees and grasses swiftly resprouted.\n\nIn an earlier Australia, these survivors would have kickstarted a process of ecosystem reassembly that would have eventually restored fire-affected areas to their original state. But today, because of great, human-wrought changes, that journey towards recovery is faltering. Climate-fuelled megafires have swept over a land filled with feral predators and pests \u2013 a land in which vital refuges have given way to forestry or farming.\n\nQ&A What is the After the Bushfires series? Show Hide The wildfires that swept through many parts of Australia between July 2019 and February 2020 were of a scale and size that is difficult to imagine. By the end of February, they had burned through at least 32,000 square miles (85,000 sq km) of Australian forest, an area the size of Ireland. Nearly 3 billion animals were killed or displaced by bushfire. The habitat of an estimated 143 million mammals, 180 million birds, 51 million frogs and 2.5 billion reptiles was burned. The fires came during Australia's hottest year on record and in a country that already has among the world's highest extinction rates because of invasive non-native species such as cats, foxes, deer, horses and various pathogens, along with habitat clearing and fragmentation. But one year on from the start of those fires, what does the landscape look like today? With state borders closing because of Covid-19, the Guardian took a virtual journey through the blackened path of Australia\u2019s summer of bushfires, talking to those who are investigating the state of the continent\u2019s surviving flora and fauna.\n\nThe fires were fed by record-breaking temperatures and drought across southern and eastern Australia. Together these trends led to a step change. Prior to the summer of 2019-20, bushfires burned 2% or less of the nation\u2019s temperate broadleaved forests. But over the black summer, 21% burned. That\u2019s a tenfold increase in a single season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A pine plantation forest starting to show post-fire regeneration on Kangaroo Island. Photograph: Quentin Chester/The Guardian\n\nThe area that a bushfire burns has an important influence on post-fire recovery. Larger burned areas mean that creatures have farther to travel to recolonise the recovering forest. Koalas are particularly vulnerable in this regard. They live atop their own funeral pyres, so fires kill many.\n\nIf the burned areas are small and infrequent, the koala\u2019s slow rates of reproduction are sufficient to allow them to recolonise the burned areas, so in the long term the population is maintained. But if the bush burns more frequently than koalas can breed and spread, they will be driven into extinction. The division of koala habitats by roads, suburbs and land clearing hastens their extinction.\n\nMegafires threaten many species. Small mammals may survive the initial blaze, but they often succumb to predation or starvation in the aftermath of the fire, so succeeding generations must come from afar. Because reptiles don\u2019t need to eat as often, they have better survival prospects. Even so, the shift from smaller fires to megafires can have a severe impact on them, because predation rates increase in the open habitats that dominate after the fire and vast areas of uniform-aged vegetation offer less varied resources.\n\nEven before the fires, introduced predators such as foxes and cats were having a severe impact on native species. But the fires have supercharged that impact. Cats can travel for tens of kilometres to feast at the fire margin, where the survivors are both concentrated and vulnerable. This predation destroys the populations that would otherwise recolonise the burned lands. Unless numbers of foxes and cats are controlled, they can drive species into extinction.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New shoots amid the charred remains of a plant on kangaroo Island. Photograph: Quentin Chester/The Guardian\n\nThe Kangaroo Island dunnart (a mouse-sized carnivorous marsupial) is a prime example. It lost 95% of its habitat to the black summer fires, with just a few hundred surviving in isolated islands of vegetation. Kangaroo Island lacks foxes, but is plagued by feral cats, and in the fire\u2019s aftermath they could easily have killed the last of the dunnarts. To prevent this, the Australian Wildlife Conservancy fenced a critical 13.8-hectare refuge in February. As the recovering population of protected dunnarts grows, it plans to create a 150-hectare permanent refuge.\n\nThe NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service is making great efforts to control the number of feral animals in the wake of the fires. Baiting to control foxes has increased fivefold, with special emphasis on the areas burned over the summer. In the largest feral animal control programme ever delivered in NSW, 60,000 fox baits will be laid over 2020, giving bandicoots, potoroos and other natives a chance of survival. And by June, more than 8,000 feral herbivores \u2013 mainly goats, deer and pigs \u2013 had been removed from national parks because their grazing can severely impact post-fire recovery. These efforts will benefit wildlife for many years.\n\nOther threats to biodiversity have become evident in the wake of the bushfires. The flooding rains that doused the fires in February did more damage to some endangered species than the fires themselves. Ponds used for breeding by critically endangered frogs such as the northern corroboree frog were destroyed by infilling with ash. And ash, charcoal and toxins flooded waterways, killing fish and other aquatic life. Even the marine environment was impacted, with toxic runoff damaging nearshore reefs and other communities around Sydney.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Heidi Groffen and Pat Hodgens from Land for Wildlife in a dunnart habitat.

The fire grounds were once covered by forests of varying ages, with different fire histories. They will be replaced by regrowing stands of uniform age, which will be vulnerable to future megafires. It remains to be seen whether we can restore diversity in vegetation age and fire history to these regions. But the growing interest in indigenous fire management offers one possible way that a mosaic of different-aged vegetation could be created.\n\nAustralia after the bushfires Read more\n\nIn the wake of our black summer, those who care for the nation\u2019s biodiversity have done a creditable job. But the ongoing decline of many species, including the koala, demonstrates that we need to do much more. In addition to reducing the greenhouse gas pollution that is driving the megafires, we need to rethink our emergency response to endangered wildlife. There is an urgent need to protect critical habitats, such as wetlands and unburned old-growth forests. And we may need to translocate koalas and other endangered species so that they can expand their distributions, and thus become more resilient, in the face of fires.\n\nThere is also an urgent need to increase our knowledge. As I read about the people working to save species from extinction after the fires, I was struck by how few people knew where the last survivors of various species were to be found. In some cases, a single doctoral student was the only person able to locate them. At this time of accelerating threat to Australia\u2019s biodiversity, we need to beef up our knowledge base, and that means greater funding to universities and the government agencies that are our first line of defence for endangered species.\n\n\u2022 Professor Tim Flannery is an author and scientist and one of Australia\u2019s leading voices on the climate crisis\n\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/31/australias-black-summer-bushfires-showed-the-impact-of-human-wrought-change-aoe", "author": ["Tim Flannery"]}, {"title": "As a Covid-19 survivor, I don't have blind faith in health experts. Here's why", "text": "As Covid-19 spreads across the United States, it leaves a slew of misinformation and conspiracy theories in its wake. The racist myths and Trumpian attempts to discredit public health officials are driven by a fundamental disbelief in science and the experts who understand it. The rise of such thinking on the right has led to a virulent defense of the scientific establishment from the left, and even the blind celebration of experts as pandemic heroes. While it\u2019s crucial to correct misinformation and defend scientists from fascist censorship, it is also necessary to question and examine the information these experts provide us with. Science is not immune from political influence, and scientific experts should not be treated as such.\n\n\u201cBlind faith in science, as if it were entirely neutral and uncontaminated by politics, is naive and dangerous.\u201d Aids activist Douglas Crimp wrote these words in 1988. In the absence of comprehensive information from a slow-moving scientific establishment, activists like Crimp sought to self-educate. \u201cWe cannot afford to leave anything up to the \u2018experts\u2019,\u201d Crimp wrote, \u201cwe must become our own experts.\u201d\n\nSince contracting Covid-19 in March and launching a virtual support group for other patients, I have witnessed first-hand the limitations of expert advice for a novel pandemic, and the need for patients to become their own experts and advocates. When my own Covid-19 case morphed and dragged on for months, I found no expert advice that applied to my situation. In April, one month into my illness, the World Health Organization was still stating that Covid-19 recoveries should only take up to two weeks, a stance they have since revoked. Connecting with thousands of other patients helped me discover that my symptoms and \u201clong-haul\u201d condition were not unusual, but it took the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention until 24 July (100+ days after many of the long-haul patients I know became ill) to release a report on long Covid-19 recovery times.\n\nCovid-19 is both a new and quickly developing virus, but scientific studies take time. Consequently, expert knowledge often lags behind patient experiences and is sometimes incorrect. In June, the WHO was heavily criticized for suggesting that airborne and asymptomatic transmission of the virus were unlikely, mistakes some have attributed to the agency\u2019s methods of working \u201cslowly and deliberately\u201d and failing to communicate information clearly, perhaps at the expense of its recommendations to the public.\n\nWhen WHO officials walked back their statement that asymptomatic transmission was \u201cvery rare\u201d, Andy Slavitt, a former acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, tweeted that WHO officials should \u201cstop expressing certainty when you don\u2019t have it.\u201d. It is equally important that the media and public retain a critical eye when seeking to understand information from WHO officials. Scientists have been criticized before for being bad communicators, but as Slavitt points out, \u201cpublic health communication isn\u2019t ancillary to public health. It is the central component in battling it.\u201d Unfortunately, a knowledge gap still exists between scientists, public health officials and the public they are supposed to serve.\n\nThis is especially the case within marginalized populations that have historically been excluded and exploited by the scientific establishment. Reports of the impact of medical bias on Covid-19 treatment indicate that our deeply flawed healthcare system and outdated medical training are contributing to coronavirus racial disparities. Science and medicine do not exist within a vacuum untouched by the other biases and systems of power that control society. As we look to doctors for information, it\u2019s important to remember the biases that may still be at play in many hospitals and treatment centers.\n\nScientific studies also have a long history of harming and ignoring women, BIPOC, and plus-sized and fat people, among other groups. Unsurprisingly, these populations may be less likely to trust experts. Not everyone who questions science and medicine believes Covid-19 is a hoax. In fact, many from highly affected communities remain skeptical because the scientific establishment has yet to prove to the American public that they can equitably handle disease outbreaks without leaving certain populations behind.\n\nScience is also not immune to political pressure; many scientists rely on government funding and cooperation, an issue activists like Crimp would have been well aware of after seeing the difficulties some experts faced under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush. The CDC has recently been criticized for being too easily sidelined, or even overtly influenced by President Trump. This spring, Rachel Maddow attributed a \u201cchange in tone\u201d in the CDC\u2019s recommendations for meatpacking plants during Covid-19 to pressure from the current administration. In April, the National Institutes for Health cut funding to the EcoHealth Alliance after reports that the group was conducting research in cooperation with a Wuhan lab that rightwing conspiracy theorists believed was responsible for the initial outbreak of Sars-CoV-2. The NIH decision was seen by many as support for such conspiracy theories. The WHO may also be navigating conflicting political forces. The New York Times reports that WHO officials face pressure from the US and China, and that the agency\u2019s decisions are overly influenced by a few conservative voices.\n\nI do not believe the world is flat, or that climate change is a myth, and I know from my days in the hospital that Covid-19 is certainly not a hoax. I also recognize that blind faith in science and medicine is inappropriate. Science accepts this fact to some extent as well; after all, the strongest critics of scientific experts are often other scientific experts. Unquestioning trust in what the scientific community tells us is especially dangerous when it comes from the left, because it precludes important conversations about the ways these fields are inextricably linked to other structures of power that we are more eager to criticize.\n\nThe Trump administration first dragged Fauci back into the public eye, but celebrating Fauci sets a dangerous precedent. In the 1980s, when Crimp was fighting for people with Aids, Fauci was clashing with activists. Aids activist Maxine Wolfe remembers Fauci as \u201cvery arrogant\u201d and dismissive of women with Aids who lacked medical credentials. The famous Aids activist Larry Kramer was also critical of Fauci, calling him a murderer, liar and \u201cReagan holdover\u201d in the San Francisco Examiner in 1988, and telling him, \u201cGo back to Washington, you bastard.\u201d\n\nKramer\u2019s and Fauci\u2019s relationship eventually improved, as did Fauci\u2019s reputation among many Aids activists. Fauci was open to discussion and did not seem to harbor the homophobia of some of his peers. The fact that Kramer died a close friend of Fauci\u2019s is due both to Fauci\u2019s openness, and Kramer\u2019s early refusal to accept Fauci as an ally.\n\nKramer\u2019s passionate criticisms and questioning ought to inspire us today, because they enabled patients and activists to achieve dialogue with the medical and scientific establishments, and eventually, long-lasting change. Our current pandemic is not the HIV/Aids epidemic of the 80s and 90s. Covid-19 is more easily transmitted, and people of all backgrounds are at risk, in contrast to the early years of Aids, when the disease was often referred to as \u201cgay cancer\u201d. However, Covid-19 and Aids both currently disproportionately impact communities of color, and thrive on institutionalized racism. As we work toward treatments and vaccines for Covid-19, we must remember that patients and activists can also be experts, and that substantive change depends on our ability to hold the scientific establishment to a higher standard, consume information critically and carefully, and question recommendations when necessary.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/30/as-a-covid-19-survivor-i-dont-have-blind-faith-in-health-experts-heres-why", "author": []}, {"title": "Lloyds' gloomy message on UK recovery is based on more than pessimism | Larry Elliott", "text": "Way back when Britain had a much bigger industrial base than today, ICI\u2019s results were seen as a sign of how well things were going. Times change, and these days it is not a manufacturing giant like ICI but a high street bank that has taken on the role of the economy\u2019s bellwether.\n\nIf what\u2019s happening at Lloyds Banking Group really is a reflection of what is happening to the UK as a whole \u2013 and there is a good argument for that \u2013 there is plenty to be concerned about. Lloyds has a big presence in the mortgage market, car loans, credit cards and business lending. It is almost entirely UK-focused.\n\nSo when the bank says that one reason for increasing its provisions against future losses is the heightened risk of mortgage default, alarm bells should start ringing in the Bank of England and the Treasury. Likewise, the fact that many of the companies that have taken advantage of the government\u2019s bounce-back loans have left the balances in their accounts.\n\nNobody expected the Lloyds Bank results for the second quarter to be anything other than dreadful, and those predictions were duly confirmed by a pre-tax loss of \u00a3676m. What Rishi Sunak and Andrew Bailey would have been hoping for was some sign of a strong recovery in the second half of 2020.\n\nThere is not much evidence of that. Lloyds is gloomier about growth, unemployment and house prices than its rival Barclays, and sees a risk that a rise in unemployment as the Treasury\u2019s furlough scheme is wound down will lead to greater mortgage distress.\n\nThose of an optimistic bent might say that Lloyds has always tended to take a conservative view when it comes to provisioning and that there is a chance losses will not be as big as it expects. But companies are stashing away their bounce-back loans for a reason; they fear a tough winter ahead.\n\nUS recovery runs out of steam\n\nForget the Great Depression. Don\u2019t even consider the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. The US economy has just suffered its worst three-month period in its history, contracting at an annual rate of more than 32%.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the world\u2019s biggest economy is going to shrink by a third this year. Due to the curious way in which the US presents its growth numbers, the hit to activity between April and June was in the region of 8% of GDP, slightly smaller than Germany\u2019s 10% drop.\n\nThe US growth figure \u2013 in line with what economists had been predicting \u2013 overshadowed the release of new jobless claims. These rose for a second week and provide a better picture of what\u2019s happening to the US economy right now. They suggest that the recovery that began in May has run out of steam.\n\nThe reason is obvious. The number of new cases of Covid-19 has more than doubled in the past six weeks and is running at 70,000 a day. With the number of deaths up from a daily low of 490 in early July to more than 1,000, restrictions have been tightened and consumers have stopped spending. A slowing economy and rising unemployment is the result. Not what an incumbent president would want with an election three months away.\n\nHomes for the high street\n\nIn a sign of things to come, the group behind the John Lewis and Waitrose brands has announced that it is thinking about turning some of its unwanted retail space into housing. The deli counters will become master bedrooms, the trolley parks bike racks.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nIt\u2019s the right approach, and certainly has a better chance of reinvigorating town centres than the online sales tax currently being considered by the Treasury. The idea that a structural problem that long predates Covid-19 can be solved by making shopping at Amazon more expensive is moonshine.\n\nA much better solution is to turn town centres into places where people live, socialise and spend money. That means fewer big supermarkets and department stores \u2013 and more homes.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/30/lloyds-gloomy-message-on-uk-recovery-is-based-on-more-than-pessimism", "author": ["Larry Elliott", "Nils Pratley"]}, {"title": "The four types of climate denier, and why you should ignore them all", "text": "A new book, described as \u201cdeeply and fatally flawed\u201d by an expert reviewer, recently reached the top of Amazon\u2019s bestseller list for environmental science and made it into a weekly top 10 list for all nonfiction titles.\n\nHow did this happen? Because, as Brendan Behan put it, \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity\u201d. In an article promoting his book, Michael Shellenberger \u2013 with jaw-dropping hubris \u2013 apologises on behalf of all environmentalists for the \u201cclimate scare we created over the last 30 years\u201d.\n\nShellenberger was named a hero of the environment by Time magazine in 2008 and is a loud advocate of nuclear power, but the article was described by six leading scientists as \u201ccherry-picking\u201d, \u201cmisleading\u201d and containing \u201coutright falsehoods\u201d.\n\nThe article was widely republished, even after being removed from its first home, Forbes, for violating the title\u2019s editorial guidelines on self-promotion, adding further heat to the storm. And this is why all those who deny the reality or danger of the climate emergency should be ignored. Obviously, I have broken my own rule here, but only to make this vital point once and for all.\n\nThe science is clear, the severity understood at the highest levels everywhere, and serious debates about what to do are turning into action. The deniers have nothing to contribute to this.\n\nHowever infuriating they are, arguing with them or debunking their theories is likely only to generate publicity or money for them. It also helps to generate a fake air of controversy over climate action that provides cover for the vested interests seeking to delay the end of the fossil fuel age.\n\nBut the deniers are not all the same. They tend to fit into one of four different categories: the shill, the grifter, the egomaniac and the ideological fool.\n\nThe shill is the easiest to understand. He, and it almost always is he, is paid by vested interests to emit clouds of confusion about the science or economics of climate action. This uncertainty creates a smokescreen behind which polluters can lobby against measures that cut their profits.\n\nA sadder case is that of the grifters. They have found themselves earning a living by grinding out contrarian articles for rightwing media outlets. Do they actually believe the guff they write? It doesn\u2019t matter: they just warm their hands on the outrage, count the clicks and wait for the pay cheque.\n\nThe egomaniacs are also tragic figures. They are disappointed, frustrated people whose careers have stalled and who can\u2019t understand why the world refuses to give full reverence to their brilliance. They are desperate for recognition, and, when it stubbornly refuses to arrive, they are drawn to make increasingly extreme pronouncements, in the hope of finally being proved a dogma-busting, 21st-century Galileo.\n\nThe ideological fool is the fourth type of climate denier, and they can be intelligent. But they are utterly blinded by their inane, no-limits version of the free-market creed. The climate emergency requires coordinated global action, they observe, and that looks horribly like communism in disguise.\n\nThey could explore the many credible climate action plans being pursued, including by those on the political right. But their cognitive dissonance forces them to the conclusion that because state intervention is wrong, acting to avert climate danger cannot be right. Intellectual gymnastics to \u201cexpose\u201d climate alarmism then follow naturally.\n\nBut why do I say ignore them all? The climate crisis is urgent, and we need debate to drive action. However, vigorous debates over action are already taking place in good faith all over the world, from the tops of governments to the smallest local action groups.\n\nEvery nation in the world signed up to the 2015 Paris climate deal, pledging to keep global heating below 2C and ideally to 1.5C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change involves thousands of international scientists and is arguably the greatest scientific endeavour in history. It has spent three decades spelling out in painstaking detail how humanity is causing global heating, how catastrophic that threatens to be \u2013 and how drastic action is required to avert the worst.\n\nThe world of finance and business is catching up fast with the science, and almost all the technology needed already exists. In short, no sane or serious actor can countenance denial of climate danger. Bad-faith arguments motivated by greed, egomania or ideology have nothing to add.\n\nWhich brings me to the US president, Donald Trump. Political leaders are the exception to the rule. Their climate idiocy should be challenged, as they hold actual power. But even in this case, reality is fast debunking their proclamations.\n\nIn the US, coal is dying, because green energy is cheaper and cleaner, however great Trump claims he will make the miners. Even if Trump, and Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, persist, other nations will begin to ostracise them via trade sanctions and border taxes.\n\nAs for the shill, grifter, egomaniac and ideological fool, the reality of increasing climate impacts and successful action is fast exposing them as well. Those willing to employ the shills and the grifters are dwindling.\n\nThe book I started with has now been knocked off the environmental bestsellers list, fittingly enough by one published by the environmental hero Rachel Carson, in 1951. I can\u2019t profess to know what Shellenberger\u2019s motivation was, but one thing is clear: the egomaniacs and ideological fools will get the place in history they so lust for. It will be a small footnote marking the useful idiots of the climate war.\n\n\u2022 Damian Carrington is the Guardian\u2019s Environment editor", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/30/climate-denier-shill-global-debate", "author": ["Damian Carrington"]}, {"title": "Young, British and black: a generation rises \u2013 podcast", "text": "The death of George Floyd in the US provoked massive anti-racism protests in the UK.

Having spent the past few months bullishly briefing that a deal was imminent, unfairly raising the hopes of millions of fans desperate to see the back of the hated Mike Ashley, the country\u2019s Public Investment Fund \u2013 along with Amanda Staveley\u2019s PCP Capital Partners and the billionaire Reuben brothers \u2013 have been forced into a hasty retreat. You hate to see it.\n\nSaudi-led consortium forced to abandon takeover of Newcastle United Read more\n\nThe first thing to point out is there may be less to all this than meets the eye. Many of the world\u2019s economies are bracing themselves for a deep and painful recession. The Covid-19 crisis has devastated Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil revenues, driving a \u00a322.3bn deficit in the second quarter of 2020. The International Monetary Fund estimates the economy could shrink by 6.8% this year. The country has already been forced to triple VAT and cut benefits. In this context, perhaps it has simply decided that ploughing untold fortunes into a huge, open-ended project with a worrying reliance on Jonjo Shelvey may not be the most propitious investment.\n\nAnd yet for all the venom and mania unleashed by this sordid tale, from the trolling of Amnesty International, to the abuse sent by some Newcastle fans to the fiancee of the late Jamal Khashoggi, to the sight of respected journalists turning into cheerleaders for the takeover, this is no time for triumphalism. The Saudis have been pushed back for now. But sport \u2013 and politics \u2013 teaches us that there is invariably someone just as bad around the corner.\n\nIn the medium term, it may well be the Saudis themselves. This is not, you suspect, the sort of regime that issues a polite thank-you note and then turns its attentions elsewhere. Once the weather has turned, once the furore has died down, once oil revenues have bounced back, they could yet return: perhaps in a different guise, perhaps outside the Premier League. A member of the Saudi royal family owns Sheffield United, having first bought a stake when they were 17th in League One and \u2013 frankly \u2013 nobody was really looking. A former minister for sport owns Almer\u00eda in the Spanish second division.\n\nFor now, though, the deal appeals to have snagged on Saudi Arabia\u2019s apparent pirating of Premier League games via its beoutQ channel. Perhaps there\u2019s something vaguely depressing about the fact that in the eyes of the Premier League this seems to be more of a red flag than any of the regime\u2019s flagrant human rights abuses.

To be a Newcastle fan for most of the past few decades has been to drink liberally from the keg of suffering: not the torture and imprisonment kind, of course, more the occasional relegation to the Championship. And yet, all they really want is what any devoted fan demands. A club to be proud of: a destination, rather than a departure lounge. An owner with ambition, respect, openness, a feel for tradition. These are traits Ashley has never remotely threatened to possess.\n\nAnother failed Newcastle takeover ends with a familiar feeling of farce | Louise Taylor Read more\n\nBut it\u2019s not a binary choice, and never has been. Newcastle fans frequently point to Abu Dhabi investment in Manchester City, or existing Saudi ties to Manchester United or large swathes of the British economy, and argue their club is being held uniquely responsible for a problem they did not create. But just because someone is running around the neighbourhood with a grenade launcher doesn\u2019t mean you arm everyone else with a grenade launcher. Just because Saudi investment is already deeply embedded in English football doesn\u2019t mean you have to throw open the doors and let them help themselves.\n\nThere are potential owners out there who aren\u2019t tied to abhorrent regimes, who don\u2019t represent states with a history of harbouring and funding global terrorism. Perhaps some day one of them will buy Newcastle, relieve the repugnant Ashley of his unwanted ward and provide the investment of time, energy and love that a club of its tradition has always deserved.

In effect the consortium walked before it was pushed.\n\nThe Guardian also understands the Premier League privately told the bid team weeks ago that it regarded the Saudi Public Investment Fund \u2013 which was hoping to acquire an 80% stake in Newcastle \u2013 as part of the Saudi state. That proved to be a key intervention because the kingdom has repeatedly blocked the Premier League taking legal action against the pirate broadcaster beoutQ for illegally streaming matches.\n\nNewcastle have had a narrow escape and may realise that in the fullness of time | Jonathan Liew Read more\n\nCrucially the owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test is failed if a crime, such as piracy, is committed overseas that would also be considered one in the UK.\n\nThis month the Saudi-led consortium was given the opportunity to restructure its bid but given the kingdom\u2019s de facto leader, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, is also chairman of PIF, it was unable to do so. There was also exasperation among Premier League circles that the Saudis failed to acknowledge a World Trade Organisation ruling that the beoutQ service was \u201coperated by individuals or entities subject to the criminal jurisdiction of Saudi Arabia\u201d.\n\nThe WTO ruling, which was first revealed by the Guardian, also said the Saudi state had breached intellectual property rights by failing to tackle piracy \u2013 yet Saudis bizarrely claimed the WTO\u2019s decision was a victory for them.\n\nThat was clearly a high-risk strategy given the Premier League had supplied evidence directly to the WTO detailing Saudi piracy. Last month the league\u2019s chief executive, Richard Masters, also told parliament it wanted Saudi Arabia to \u201crespond positively to the situation and allow sports rights holders to protect their rights\u201d \u2013 something it repeatedly failed to do.\n\nWhile the Premier League refused to comment on Thursday, sources close to the consortium comprising the PIF, Amanda Staveley\u2019s PCP Capital Partners and Reuben Brothers accused it of continually \u201cmoving the goalposts\u201d after initially indicating they would approve the deal.\n\nThe bid, finalised with the Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, in March, had been gridlocked for the past 17 weeks during which Newcastle effectively became a pawn in the three-year cold war between Saudi Arabia and Qatar as Tynesiders dreamed of supporting England\u2019s richest club.\n\nSources close to the consortium claim that, in April, the Premier League privately informed them the deal would be approved and there were \u201cno red lights\u201d but, instead, countless barriers were thrown up as the governing body grew increasingly concerned about the legal separation between PIF and the Saudi government.\n\nAs Newcastle fans struggled to accept they were stuck with the unpopular Ashley, a tearful Staveley claimed Masters had bowed to pressure from rival clubs, with Liverpool and Tottenham said to be among those who had opposed the buy-out.\n\n\u201cWe are heartbroken obviously,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course we do [blame the Premier League]. They had a chance, they say we have not answered all the questions and we have done so. But the other clubs in the Premier League didn\u2019t want it to happen.\u201d\n\nStaveley also told the Times: \u201cThe piracy issue was not an issue but we tried to resolve it anyway.

As he tended his long-neglected garden during lockdown, Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor was confronted by a blizzard of headlines, some suggesting he was to be imminently replaced by Mauricio Pochettino or, more likely Ben\u00edtez, others indicating he would be handed the cash to prove himself.\n\nIf Newcastle fans feel like holidaymakers who turn up at the airport supposedly bound for a five-star Caribbean holiday only to end up being redirected to a two-star hotel on the English coast amid a particularly cold and rainy summer, Bruce is possibly a little more conflicted.\n\nMuch as he would have loved to reinvest the consortium\u2019s supposed \u00a3250m five-year transfer budget \u2013 and delighted as a man who grew up in Wallsend would have been to see new owners undertake urban regeneration projects across Tyneside \u2013 he also has reason for private relief.\n\nIt was not lost on Newcastle\u2019s manager that Owen Brown, a close friend and adviser to Ben\u00edtez, was earmarked for a seat on the new board and had been supplying the consortium with advice on transfer targets. Only last week Brown was involved in two virtual transfer summits with the would-be owners.\n\nGiven his closeness to Ben\u00edtez it does not take too great a leap of the imagination to have envisaged the Spaniard, much adored on Tyneside, returning to St James\u2019 Park from his posting in China. The first hint of results slipping next season would surely have had Bruce looking, nervously, over his shoulder.\n\nNow he is left with the, albeit dysfunctional, devil he knows. After all Bruce is accustomed to the lengthy radio silences from Ashley and communicating through Lee Charnley, Newcastle\u2019s managing director. Even so he could have done without the owner being said to have, emotionally and mentally, checked out of St James\u2019 Park.\n\nNewcastle supporters have been protesting against Mike Ashley for the majority of his 13-year ownership Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters\n\nGiven that few owners can have been as disengaged as the retail tycoon in recent times, the manager cannot be remotely optimistic about his transfer budget during a summer window in which Newcastle are already starting on the back foot.\n\nCharnley is not overly popular among Newcastle fans but an executive who, in March, was told he would soon be clearing his office by the incoming consortium has done a decent job in running the club while serving as the conduit for sometimes mixed messages between the would-be buyers, Ashley and the Premier League.\n\nEven so, his own horizon remains deeply uncertain. Charnley remains acutely aware that Ashley, having spent most of his 13-year ownership attempting, forlornly, to sell Newcastle, is unlikely to give up now.\n\nThe past decade has seen at least eight supposedly serious so-called \u201cfakeovers\u201d command the attention of supporters and media. But whether it was down to an unwillingness to sell or, more usually, a lack of the necessary funds, everyone connected to the club has become worn down by the now almost annual talk of a brave new dawn on Gallowgate.\n\nMemories of supposed buyouts involving, in no particular order and among others, the local businessman Barry Moat, Peter Kenyon, a Nigerian consortium, Dubai\u2019s Bin Zayed Group, mysterious Chinese investors, Geoff Sheard, and an earlier attempt on Staveley\u2019s part have left a legacy of considerable scepticism.\n\nNo wonder considerable doubts swirl around the depiction of Henry Mauriss, a little-known American television executive, as Newcastle\u2019s new saviour. Mauriss\u2019s camp claim he will pay Ashley \u00a3350m in exchange for the keys to St James\u2019 Park but the extent of his wealth appears unclear. And, why, would he be prepared to pay \u00a350m more than the Saudis at a time of looming global financial catastrophe?\n\nBruce will doubtless be resigned to yet another postponement of ambitious plans to overhaul Newcastle\u2019s outdated training ground, revamp the underperforming academy and restructure an oft-criticised recruitment network.\n\nHis vision of weaning the team from their old default, cagey counterattacking approach to a more expansive passing style will endure but implementation must be cautious and signings cut-price rather than Philippe Coutinho calibre.\n\nIn almost every way Newcastle are well and truly back in the slow lane.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jul/30/another-failed-newcastle-united-takeover-ends-with-an-all-too-familiar-feeling-of-farce", "author": ["Louise Taylor"]}, {"title": "LA Lakers and Utah Jazz squeak by as NBA reopens amid player protests", "text": "Black players were next to white players.

The Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers repeated the demonstration before the second game of the re-opening night doubleheader later Thursday.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s critical that all of us, in a unified way, turn attention to social justice,\u201d Snyder said during a televised in-game interview. \u201cAnd all the players, all the coaches, are united in that fact and committed to do what we can do to effect long-term change.\u201d\n\nMany players warmed up wearing shirts that said \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019. Thursday also marked the debut of new jerseys bearing messages that many players chose to have added, such as \u2018Equality\u2019 and \u2018Peace\u2019.\n\nThe NBA season was suspended when Rudy Gobert who also scored the first basket of the restarted season of the Jazz tested positive for the coronavirus and became the first player in the league with such a diagnosis.\n\nGobert was diagnosed on 11 March; two days later, Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman, was fatally shot when police officers burst into her Louisville, Kentucky apartment using a no-knock warrant during a narcotics investigation. The warrant was in connection with a suspect who did not live there and no drugs were found.\n\nThen on 25 March, Floyd died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into the Black man\u2019s neck for nearly eight minutes. That happened on a street, with the images and sounds of the man saying he couldn\u2019t breathe, then crying out for his mother all captured on a cell phone video.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Members of the New Orleans Pelicans and Utah Jazz kneel together around the Black Lives Matter logo before Thursday\u2019s first game. Photograph: Ashley Landis/USA Today Sports\n\nNBA players have used their platforms both in the bubble and on social media to demand equality, to demand justice for Taylor. Coaches have also said it is incumbent on them to demand change and educate themselves and others. And the pregame actions by the Jazz and the Pelicans were just the start of what is expected to be a constant during the remainder of this season.\n\n\u201cWe want our lives to be valued as much as everybody else,\u201d Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum said in a video that aired before the game, a project organized by both the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that we\u2019re better. We want to be seen as equals.\u201d\n\nAdded Chris Paul, the Oklahoma City Thunder guard and president of the NBPA, speaking in the same video: \u201cThings aren\u2019t going to change until we sort of make them change.\u201d\n\nGentry said he appreciated the accidental symmetry that came from the first games of the restarted season coming only hours after the funeral for US representative John Lewis, who died July 17 at the age of 80.\n\nLewis spent most of his life championing civil rights and equality and was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March on Washington the one where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Gentry said he believes this movement, like the one Lewis helped spark six decades ago, will endure.\n\n\u201cIf you talk to some of the younger generation, I think this is here to stay. I really do,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cI have a 20-year-old son and a 22-year-old son, and I know that they feel like this is the most opportune time for us to try to have change in this country.\u201d\n\nLA Clippers 101-103 LA Lakers\n\nLeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers showed some rust.\n\nThey knocked it off with time to spare.\n\nAnthony Davis scored 34 points, James had the go-ahead basket with 12.8 seconds left and the Lakers moved closer to clinching the No 1 seed in the Western Conference playoffs by topping the Los Angeles Clippers 103-101 on Thursday night in the second game of the NBA\u2019s re-opening doubleheader.\n\nJames had 16 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists to help the Lakers move six and a half games ahead of the Clippers in the West with seven games remaining. Kyle Kuzma added 16 points.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a real game to me, two teams battling. ... Can\u2019t complain for the first game,\u201d Davis said.\n\nPaul George had 30 points and Kawhi Leonard scored 28 for the Clippers, who had an 11-point lead midway through the third in a game with deep ebbs and flows. The Clippers got that lead after a 26-5 run; the Lakers immediately rebutted with a 36-14 run to reclaim control.\n\nAnd it still came down to the final moments.\n\nGeorge\u2019s three-pointer with 1:50 left cut the Lakers\u2019 lead to 99-98. James muscled his way to a layup on the next possession, and then George hit another three to tie the game at 101 with 29 seconds remaining.\n\nJames followed his own miss down the lane for the go-ahead basket, then was brilliant on the last defensive possession \u2013 forcing the ball out of Leonard\u2019s hands and covering George as his three-point try at the buzzer misfired.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have self-inflicted wounds and I thought we had too many of them,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, whose team \u2013 which remains short-handed with Lou Williams still in quarantine and Montrezl Harrell tending to a family matter \u2013 gave up 29 points off turnovers.\n\nThursday marked the NBA\u2019s first game action in 141 days, the league getting back to work after the coronavirus pandemic forced a shutdown.\n\nJames \u2013 who is going to win his first assist title \u2013 had five in the first quarter to get teammates going, and then his first basket of the restart came on a dunk early in the second quarter to put the Lakers up 37-24.\n\nBut for a stretch that basically spanned a full quarter, spanning the second and third periods, the Lakers couldn\u2019t make a shot. They went 1 for 10 to end the half, then 0 for 9 to start the third and the Clippers took advantage.\n\nThey turned a 50-40 deficit into a 66-55 edge in the third. And then it was the Lakers\u2019 turn to rally, slicing the Clippers\u2019 lead to 77-76 going into the fourth.\n\n\u201cIt was a good game,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cStill had fun out there. It was great to be back on the floor.\u201d\n\nUtah Jazz 106-104 New Orleans Pelicans\n\nRudy Gobert sank two free throws with 6.9 seconds left to cap a 14-point, 12-rebound and three-block performance, giving the Utah Jazz a 106-104 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans in the first game of the NBA\u2019s restart.\n\nNew Orleans, which led for most of the game and by as many as 16 points, nearly pulled out the victory as time expired when Brandon Ingram\u2019s three-point attempt rimmed out in a bitter end to his 23-point night.\n\nZion Williamson, who missed nearly two weeks of practice after leaving the team for a family medical matter on July 16, was deemed fit to start, although his playing time was limited.\n\nHe scored 13 points in just more than 15 minutes, highlighted by a couple alley-oop dunks, one on a nearly half-court lob from Lonzo Ball.\n\nBut Williamson checked out for good with 7:19 left in the fourth quarter and had to watch the tense finish from the sideline.\n\nJordan Clarkson scored 23 points for Utah and helped lead a second-half comeback, while Donovan Mitchell and Mike Conley each added 20.\n\nJJ Redick scored 21, including a clutch 3 to tie it at 102, while Jrue Holiday added 20 points for New Orleans.\n\nThe game was tied at 104 after Ingram\u2019s free throws with 32 seconds left and Conley missed inside with just less than 20 seconds to go, but got his own rebound. The Jazz moved the ball to Mitchell, whose drive forced New Orleans to collapse on him before he fed Gobert for a dunk attempt that Derrick Favors could only stop with forceful foul.\n\nGobert, who\u2019d featured prominently on defense with clean rejections of Williamson and Favors, calmly made the deciding foul shots.\n\nWith Williamson on the bench, New Orleans closed the first quarter with an 18-4 run, highlighted by Ingram\u2019s dunk, finger roll and 3, to take a lead they would hold until late in the fourth quarter.\n\nNew Orleans had its biggest lead when Holiday\u2019s fadeaway made it 60-44 late in the second quarter, and the Pelicans took a 60-48 advantage into halftime.\n\nAfter Utah methodically pulled within one possession in the middle of the fourth quarter, New Orleans threatened to pull away again when Ingram hit a pull-up and E\u2019Twaun Moore hit a three made possible by Jaxson Hayes\u2019 offensive rebound.\n\nBut the Jazz weren\u2019t finished, going on an 11-1 run, marked by Mitchell\u2019s driving floater off the glass, to take a late three-point lead inside the final four minutes.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/30/nba-opening-night-jazz-pelicans-lakers-clippers", "author": ["Associated Press"]}, {"title": "Chinese state TV maintains blackout of NBA games as season resumes", "text": "China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV maintained its blackout of NBA games as the American basketball league resumed on Friday, extending a freedom-of-speech stand-off that stretches back more than nine months.\n\nLA Lakers and Utah Jazz squeak by as NBA reopens amid player protests Read more\n\nAlthough Chinese internet giant Tencent streamed the NBA\u2019s return from a four-month coronavirus shutdown, the world\u2019s most popular basketball competition remained inaccessible to China\u2019s TV audiences.\n\nCCTV suspended all broadcasts of NBA matches in October after a Houston Rockets executive tweeted in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, unleashing a firestorm of criticism in China.\n\nThe NBA commands a huge following in China \u2013 its biggest and most lucrative market outside of the US \u2013 and the subsequent fall-out has cost the league more than $300m in revenue.\n\nAfter NBA executives defended Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression, numerous Chinese business partners and celebrities cut ties with the league, games in China were cancelled and the season was pulled from the airwaves.\n\nCCTV \u2013 which holds exclusive TV rights for the league in China \u2013 posted a statement in May reiterating it had severed ties with the NBA, in response to online rumors that the games may be broadcast again.\n\n\u201cOn issues concerning China\u2019s sovereignty, CCTV Sports\u2019 attitude is solemn, clear and consistent with no room whatsoever for ambiguity or manoeuvre,\u201d CCTV wrote.\n\nAs the league tried to contain the fallout, US politicians also slammed the league for trying to appease the Chinese government.\n\nIn May, the NBA named Michael Ma \u2013 the son of CCTV Sports executive Ma Guoli \u2013 as CEO of NBA China, as speculation swirled that his appointment could help warm ties with the state broadcaster.\n\nHowever, the nationalist tabloid Global Times wrote earlier this month that \u201cit remains unlikely that the games will return to Chinese platforms if the issues between the NBA and the Chinese public are not solved\u201d.\n\nIt emerged earlier this week that the NBA last year ended its association with a training centre in China\u2019s western Xinjiang region, where Beijing faces growing international condemnation over its treatment of minorities.\n\nAn ESPN report this week alleged that young players at the NBA\u2019s China academies were physically abused and left without schooling, and that the NBA was \u201cre-evaluating\u201d the program.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/31/chinese-state-tv-maintains-blackout-of-nba-games-as-season-resumes", "author": []}, {"title": "Willian still wanted at Chelsea but may play his way into Arsenal's hands", "text": "Frank Lampard does not want to lose the Brazilian despite having no shortage of attacking options, with more to come\n\nAt first glance it might seem odd Frank Lampard is so keen for Willian to stay at Chelsea. Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech are already training with their new teammates, Kai Havertz is close to joining from Bayer Leverkusen and there is a danger that the manager is going to become Brentwood\u2019s answer to Ossie Ardiles when he starts working out how to deploy his attacking options next season.\n\nSomething surely has to give. Werner is going to be competing with Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud up front and can also operate from the left. Ziyech can play on the right or in the hole. Christian Pulisic and Callum Hudson-Odoi are exciting options on either flank, Ross Barkley, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount all play advanced roles in midfield and although Chelsea are right to focus on improving their goal threat after losing Eden Hazard to Real Madrid last summer that attack is starting to look crowded.\n\nWhich brings us to the intrigue surrounding Willian, who is out of contract at the end of the season and a target for Arsenal, Chelsea\u2019s opponents in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final. It is verging on saga territory \u2013 Chelsea\u2019s offer of a two-year deal has been on the table for months \u2013 and there was a development this week when the Brazilian\u2019s agent, Kia Joorabchian, said the 31-year-old winger had offers from five clubs: two in Europe, two in the Premier League and one in Major League Soccer.\n\nWillian \u2018happy\u2019 and eager to stay at Chelsea but club yet to offer new deal Read more\n\nJoorabchian was involved when another Brazilian, David Luiz, left Chelsea for Arsenal last summer and his latest intervention was not particularly helpful given the doubts it raises over Willian\u2019s focus before the Wembley final. Yet some Chelsea fans just shrugged their shoulders. Willian, who wants a three-year deal, has tended to divide opinion during his seven years at the club and many think this is a good time to say farewell.\n\nLampard sees it differently. Although he acknowledges that some forwards need to leave, especially if Chelsea are to bolster their defence with the signings of Leicester\u2019s Ben Chilwell and West Ham\u2019s Declan Rice, he does not want Willian to go. Barkley and Michy Batshuayi, who has a year on his deal, are more obvious odd men out.\n\nIt may not make immediate sense given that Chelsea have so much potential in attack. Pedro, another veteran winger, is being allowed to join Roma on a free and has barely been used since the season resumed. The Spaniard signed a short-term extension to stay until the end of the delayed season, as did Willian, and has since made four brief substitute appearances.\n\nBy contrast Willian has remained a regular and when Lampard makes his case to the board he can point to the Brazilian\u2019s output in the league this season: nine goals, seven assists and a key role in Chelsea overcoming last summer\u2019s transfer ban by qualifying for the Champions League.\n\nYet there are other qualities to consider: assets that tend to be valued more by managers than fans. It is not just about the highlights reel. Willian\u2019s experience has been valuable during a season in which Chelsea have used a lot of young players and although he is touch and go to face Arsenal after missing last week\u2019s win over Wolves with an achilles injury, he remains in excellent condition overall and feels he has a good few years at the top left.\n\nThat fitness record should not be discounted, especially as Pulisic and Hudson-Odoi have suffered from niggles this season, and Lampard also feels his work ethic and willingness to track back are an example for his young players.\n\n\u201cOn the ball, we all know his ability,\u201d the manager said after Chelsea\u2019s 2-0 win over Crystal Palace last November. \u201cBut his off-the-ball work is an outstanding example for Callum Hudson-Odoi, for Christian Pulisic, for other young players who think the only part of the game is going by people, crossing or shooting. He does the other side brilliant with absolute humility.\u201d\n\nAnother factor is that Chelsea, who face Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the Champions League the following weekend, do not want to lose Willian for nothing to a rival. Brinkmanship is the order of the day. Two years or three years? There is little room for manoeuvre and unless one side blink, the smart money is on Willian joining David Luiz in north London.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/31/willian-still-wanted-at-chelsea-but-may-play-his-way-into-arsenals-hands", "author": ["Jacob Steinberg"]}, {"title": "Manchester City land Bournemouth's Nathan Ak\u00e9 in \u00a341m move", "text": "Manchester City have agreed to sign Nathan Ak\u00e9 from Bournemouth for \u00a340m, rising to a possible \u00a341m with add-ons.

Spiegel\u2019s source, Rui Pinto, who is charged with computer hacking in his native Portugal, which he denies, has denied that he obtained the emails by criminal means.\n\nCity have vehemently denied that the Etihad sponsorship was subsidised by the club\u2019s owner, Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, or any other Abu Dhabi entity, since Spiegel first published the emails, and throughout the subsequent investigation and ultimate guilty finding by Uefa\u2019s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) adjudicatory chamber (AC). Pearce and senior Etihad executives gave evidence at the Cas hearing, categorically denying the finding, largely based on the published emails, that the airline did not pay the sponsorships in full.\n\nThe emails considered by the CFCB and Cas included three from City\u2019s then financial officers to Pearce, a City board member and senior adviser on the Executive Affairs Authority (EAA), a strategic Abu Dhabi government authority. The finance officers set out that in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2015-16 Etihad paid only \u00a38m of sponsorship deals City stated to be \u00a335m, \u00a365m and \u00a367.5m respectively. The rest, they wrote, was being paid by Mansour\u2019s company ownership vehicle, the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG).\n\nCity had refused requests from the CFCB for Pearce and other senior people to give evidence, and Cas severely criticised the club and imposed a \u20ac10m (\u00a39m) fine for their failure to cooperate and obstruction of the investigation. Pearce did appear before Cas, as did James Hogan, the former Etihad chief executive, and other senior figures, and based largely on their evidence, the Cas panel overturned by a 2-1 majority the CFCB conclusion that Mansour \u201cdisguised\u201d his own funding as Etihad sponsorship.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sheikh Mansour with Manchester City\u2019s Sergio Ag\u00fcero in Abu Dhabi during 2017. Photograph: Victoria Haydn/Manchester City FC via Getty Images\n\nSpiegel published the new emails two days after Cas released the full 93-page judgment that detailed its reasons.\n\nOne of the new emails was sent by Pearce in December 2013, from his Executive Affairs Authority address to Peter Baumgartner, then Etihad\u2019s chief commercial officer, with the subject \u201cpayments\u201d. Pearce set out that under its sponsorship agreement Etihad had owed City \u00a331.5m for the 2012-13 season, and \u00a367.5m for the \u00a32013-14 season, a total of \u00a399m.\n\n\u201cSo we should be receiving a total of \u00a399m \u2013 of which you will provide \u00a38m,\u201d he wrote to Baumgartner. \u201dI therefore should have forwarded \u00a391m and instead have sent you only \u00a388.5m. I effectively owe you \u00a32.5m.\u201d\n\nPearce offered Baumgartner two options to reconcile the missing \u00a32.5m. The first was for Etihad to pay only \u00a365m of the \u00a367.5m sponsorship for 2013-14 and pay the \u00a32.5m the following year. The second option, Pearce wrote, was: \u201cYou pay the \u00a365m now and I will forward the \u00a32.5m in a couple of months \u2013 at which point you can forward it on.\u201d\n\nPearce apologised to Baumgartner for the missing \u00a32.5m he had not sent, writing: \u201cAs I am sure you knew, embarrassingly it would seem that rather than overpaying you I have underpaid you!\u201d\n\nThe figure of \u00a388.5m Pearce apparently sent to Etihad for forwarding to City tallies with the same figure, \u00a388.5m, set out to Pearce in one of the previously published emails. That was sent five days earlier by Jorge Chumillas, City\u2019s then chief financial officer, who said the breakdown of Etihad\u2019s sponsorship of City was \u00a388.5m from ADUG, while Etihad was paying \u00a38m.\n\nPearce\u2019s evidence to Cas about the City\u2019s finance officers writing in their emails that only \u00a38m was coming from Etihad, was that the arrangements had caused \u201csome confusion among individuals at the club\u201d and \u201ca misunderstanding that ADUG was making funds available to Etihad\u201d.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nCity declined to provide a response to the contents of the new emails, as they did publicly in 2018, so they did not explain why or in what capacity Pearce was apparently sending \u00a391m to the chief commercial officer of Etihad for its sponsorship of City.\n\nThe club said in a statement: \u201cThe questions and matters raised by Der Spiegel appear to be a cynical attempt to publicly re-litigate and undermine a case that has been fully adjudicated, after detailed proceedings and due process, by the court of arbitration for sport.\n\n\u201cManchester City\u2019s policy remains not to comment on out of context materials purported to have been criminally obtained from City Football Group and Manchester City personnel.\u201d", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/30/der-spiegel-claims-new-manchester-city-emails-cast-doubt-on-cas-verdict", "author": ["David Conn"]}, {"title": "Hamilton hopes F1 is united in protest as P\u00e9rez tests positive for Covid-19", "text": "Lewis Hamilton is optimistic Formula One will present a united front against racism, although there remains disagreement behind the scenes on how the sport approaches it as Sergio P\u00e9rez became the first F1 driver to test postive for Covid-19 before this weekend\u2019s British Grand Prix.\n\nThe Racing Point driver has entered quarantine and was not at Silverstone on Thursday but racing will continue this weekend as planned, with his team using a reserve driver.\n\nLewis Hamilton says Formula One is not taking racism seriously Read more\n\n\u201cWith assistance of the local organiser of the British Grand Prix, local health authorities and the FIA Covid-19 delegate, a full track and trace initiative has been undertaken and all close contacts have been quarantined,\u201d the FIA said in a statement.\n\nHamilton said he had talked to F1\u2019s leaders and welcomed the adoption of a formal ceremony to show a united front against racism before Sunday\u2019s race. However, it also became clear that a large number of drivers had been questioning whether they should continue with any gestures.\n\nHamilton has been outspoken in his support for the anti-racism movement and expressed frustration and disappointment at the lack of leadership after the gesture in Hungary was rushed and disorganised, with some drivers not present. He has since addressed the issue with the Grand Prix Drivers\u2019 Association, the FIA president, Jean Todt, F1\u2019s chief executive, Chase Carey, and the sporting director, Ross Brawn.\n\n\u201cI had great conversations with them to understand what they are planning and that we are all on the same team here,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving us that extra time before the race we can show how united we are as a sport because other sports have done a better job at consistently doing that.\u201d\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nHamilton, F1\u2019s only black driver, also confirmed his intent was to continue racing for some time. \u201cThere\u2019s not another driver from my background coming and I\u2019m conscious of that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to be here for the foreseeable future.

However in explaining his position Grosjean revealed he had felt duty bound to represent the \u201cseven or eight drivers who were not happy to carry on\u201d. That equates to more than a third of the grid.\n\n\u201cIn the GPDA, we work on the majority-vote system, and I felt that if I wasn\u2019t, as one of the directors, listening to the drivers who were not happy to carry on, I wasn\u2019t doing my duties. He [Hamilton] mentioned that as one of the directors they\u2019re listening to you, and that was his point, and I think he was right in that aspect.\u201d\n\nSix drivers did not take a knee at the ceremony in Austria: Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Daniil Kvyat, Carlos Sainz and Antonio Giovinazzi.

There was no fighting in Germany during the cold war.\n\nThe Pentagon has insisted the withdrawal was ordered as part as an overall strategic repositioning of US forces abroad, but Donald Trump made clear that he saw it as punishment of Germany for not spending enough on defence.\n\nPompeo said that the state department had been part of the discussion about the redeployment, which involves 6,400 soldiers being brought to the US and another 5,500 being placed elsewhere in Europe, mostly Belgium and Italy.\n\nQuestioning Pompeo at a hearing of the Senate foreign relations committee, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen said: \u201cThe only country that has publicly supported the removal of US troops from Germany today has been Russia.\u201d\n\nThe Republican senator Mitt Romney, reflecting widespread unease in the GOP about the move, told Pompeo: \u201cI have heard from the highest levels of the German government that this is seen by them as an insult to Germany, and I can\u2019t imagine at a time when we need to be drawing in our friends and allies so that we can collectively confront China, we want to insult them.\u201d\n\nPompeo insisted that the withdrawal of troops to the US did not mean they were \u201coff the field\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese units will participate in rotational activity.

In 2013, the Supreme Court invalidated a crucial component of the landmark law, ruling that Congress had not taken into account the nation\u2019s racial progress when citing certain states for federal oversight.

Cain, who co-chaired Black Voices for Trump, was photographed maskless and not socially distancing at the event.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCain is one of the most prominent Americans to have died of the virus, which has claimed more than 150,000 lives in the United States. Word of his death comes amid a heightened focus on how seriously Republicans have taken advice from medical experts.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Louie Goh\u00admert (R-Tex.), who had been seen walking the halls of the U.S. Capitol without a mask and not socially distancing, announced that he had tested positive shortly before a planned Air Force One flight with President Trump.\n\nTributes to Cain\u2019s business accomplishments and political endeavors poured in from leading Republicans after the announcement of his death.\n\n\u201cMy friend Herman Cain, a Powerful Voice of Freedom and all that is good, passed away this morning,\u201d Trump said in tweets in which he relayed that he had spoken to members of Cain\u2019s family. \u201cHerman had an incredible career and was adored by everyone that ever met him, especially me. He was a very special man, an American Patriot, and great friend.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Cain \u201cled an accomplished life \u2014 business titan, cancer survivor, and Republican presidential candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will always be remembered for his love of country,\u201d McCarthy added in a tweet.\n\nCain was hospitalized less than two weeks after attending Trump\u2019s campaign rally in Tulsa. Before being hospitalized, he advertised in a tweet that masks would not be required at an Independence Day celebration that Trump staged at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.\n\n\u201cPEOPLE ARE FED UP!\u201d Cain wrote.\n\nAn update posted on Cain\u2019s Twitter feed three weeks ago said he was \u201cstill in an Atlanta-area hospital, where doctors are trying to make sure his oxygen levels are right.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a tough virus, but we serve a tougher God. Herman wants to get back in action soon, so please continue praying,\u201d the tweet said.\n\nAD\n\nBob Jack, chairman of the Tulsa County Republican Party, said the party was actively seeking to speak with those who had met with Cain at Trump\u2019s rally in Tulsa, where he was photographed sitting with other Black Republicans without a mask and not practicing social distancing.\n\n\u201cLooking for people that attended the President Trump Rally and met with Herman Cain,\u201d Jack posted on the party\u2019s Facebook page Thursday afternoon. \u201cPlease call the Tulsa GOP office and leave a message for the Chairman.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Jack said he was aware Cain was at the rally but that he was \u201ckind of under the radar.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t talk to anyone that actually spent time with him,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe have not received any reports of anyone contracting covid at the rally. I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s not somebody out there. I\u2019m just saying we haven\u2019t received any reports from anybody directly linked to the rally. I thought somebody would have caught it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe June 20 rally was widely derided by public health officials, and its more than 6,000 participants largely eschewed masks and did not sit in a socially distanced way; in fact, placards placed on every other seat to ensure social distancing were removed before the rally started. Several Secret Service agents and advance staff tested positive before the rally. Tulsa\u2019s health director, Bruce Dart, later said the rally \u201clikely\u201d contributed to a spike in Tulsa\u2019s covid cases.\n\n\u201cIt was reckless for the event to have been held,\u201d said state Rep. Regina Goodwin, a Democrat who represents the Tulsa area. \u201cThe death of Herman Cain is evidence of that recklessness and the insensitivity of Donald Trump. Unfortunately Herman Cain died, but he chose to attend the rally without a mask . . . basically that is a life, a human being who should not be dead.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s unclear where and when Cain contracted the virus.\n\nAD\n\nParis Dennard, an advisory board member for Black Voices for Trump, attended the rally but said he wanted to limit his responses in the interview to the \u201clife and legacy of Herman Cain\u201d rather than speak about his own health or Cain\u2019s.\n\nHe said that he first met Cain at a Republican conference in 2009 and had worked with him on Republican causes ever since, including Black Voices for Trump, an advisory group launched by Trump at an event in November in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cEvery time there was a conference call or meeting, Herman always had questions. They weren\u2019t real questions, more like long comments,\u201d Dennard said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have a wise uncle in your family, but he reminded me of my Paw Paw, who passed away in 2004, a wise, elder statesman. You knew wisdom is speaking and somebody with experience is talking.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough he was photographed close to Cain at the rally, he declined to discuss the photograph in detail, except to say he personally \u201cfollows the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines\u201d about mask-wearing and noted that many people often take their masks off when being photographed.\n\nA number of Black surrogates for Trump attended the rally, including media personalities Diamond and Silk; T.W. Shannon, former Oklahoma state representative; television analyst Carol Swain; Texas State Rep. James White; K. Carl Smith of Alabama; Legacy Republicans Alliance President Corrin Rankin; conservative author Deneen Borelli; former NFL player Jack Brewer; activist Kiyan Michael; activist Alveda King; Atlanta business executive Sharon LeVell; entrepreneur Madgie Nicolas; the Rev.

Williams; Philadelphia GOP leader Calvin Tucker; and author David Harris Jr.\n\nDuring his bid for the 2012 Republican nomination, ultimately won by Mitt Romney, Cain became known for his simplified tax plan, known as Nine-Nine-Nine, and for complaints that he sexually harassed women.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nine-Nine-Nine tax plan would have dramatically reworked the tax system. It would have set tax rates at 9 percent for income tax, sales tax and corporate tax.\n\nTrump met with Cain in January 2019 about joining the Federal Reserve Board. Asked for comment in an interview at the time on whether he was being considered for the post, Cain made a play on his famous tax proposal and said, \u201cNone-None-None.\u201d\n\nCain confirmed, though, that he was at the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to miss a six-foot Black man in a black hat walking out of the White House,\u201d he said with a laugh. He later withdrew himself from consideration, citing \u201chow big a pay cut this would be.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCain served on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, but those posts are often given to business executives and community leaders who serve to inform top Fed officials about what they are seeing in the labor market and the economy more broadly.\n\nAD\n\nCain withdrew from consideration for the central bank position after some lawmakers, economists and Wall Street investors questioned his qualifications for the post, and noted the allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct that derailed his 2012 presidential campaign. One of the accusers said she would testify at his confirmation hearing if given the chance.\n\nSome lawmakers also had concerns that the nomination of a close political ally of the president, who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Trump and lashed out at his critics, would threaten the bank\u2019s independence.\n\nCain\u2019s momentary ascent to the heights of Republican presidential politics in 2011 mirrored his first emergence in the political world nearly two decades earlier, with the power of his personality, plus his roots as a Baptist preacher and business executive making national headlines and connecting with some voters.\n\nIn 1994, Cain, as chairman and CEO of Godfather\u2019s Pizza, confronted President Bill Clinton during a televised town hall about health care. Cain\u2019s conservative critique made him a minor star of sorts in the GOP at the time, and led him to build relationships with then-House GOP powerhouse Newt Gingrich and New York Congressman Jack Kemp, among others. He later supported Steve Forbes\u2019s 2000 presidential bid.\n\nBut in 2004, when he finally jumped into the political arena as a candidate, Cain was defeated by Johnny Isakson in Georgia\u2019s Republican Senate primary, a setback he would often reference as a contest that taught him about politics. Two years later, he was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer, but after chemotherapy it subsided.\n\nOnce cancer-free, Cain began to muse about a presidential campaign of his own and began to give frequent speeches across the nation to business and conservative groups, slowly building his profile with talks and a syndicated column and media appearances. Fox News host Sean Hannity became a personal ally, and tea party groups started to make him a regular at gatherings.\n\nYet Cain was not an ideologue on spending, unlike some tea-party counterparts \u2014 a nod to the conservative populism that was later taken up by Trump. In 2008, Cain criticized \u201cfree-market purists\u201d in his column and supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/herman-cain-former-republican-presidential-hopeful-has-died-of-the-coronavirus-statement-on-his-website-says/2020/07/30/4ac62a10-d273-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html", "author": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter On The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress", "Annie Gowen", "National Correspondent"]}, {"title": "Epstein accuser alleged in newly unsealed deposition that Ghislaine Maxwell was his partner in abuse", "text": "The unsealed court documents stem from a defamation suit she settled for an undisclosed sum in 2017 with the woman, Virginia Giuffre, who has alleged that she was forced to have sex with Epstein and his friends. She has claimed that Maxwell recruited her to serve as a traveling masseuse for Epstein after spotting her working a summer job as a locker room attendant 20 years ago at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump\u2019s private estate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiuffre\u2019s deposition was among several hundred pages of records unsealed by judicial order late Thursday.\n\nIn her testimony, which she gave in 2016, Giuffre describes Maxwell and Epstein as a toxic team that repeatedly exploited her, emphasizing that Maxwell \u201cbrought me in for the purpose of being trafficked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to understand that [Epstein] and [Maxwell] are joined at the hip, okay?\u201d Giuffre said, when asked about who Maxwell sent her to for sex.\n\n\u201cJeffrey was just as a part of it as she was,\u201d Giuffre said. \u201c[Maxwell] was just as a part of it as he was.\u201d\n\nAt another point, she said of Maxwell: \u201cShe\u2019s the one who abused me on a regular basis. She\u2019s the one that procured me, told me what to do, trained me as a sex slave, abused me physically, abused me mentally. She\u2019s the one who I believe, in my heart of hearts, deserves to come forward and have justice happen to her more than anybody. Being a woman, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMaxwell, the daughter of the late media tycoon Robert Maxwell, has denied her claims.\n\n\u201cVirginia is an absolute liar and everything she has said is a lie,\u201d she said in a 2016 deposition. \u201cTherefore, based on those lies I cannot speculate on what anybody else did or didn\u2019t do \u2026 everything she said is false.\u201d\n\nThe unsealed documents also included emails exchanged between Epstein and Maxwell in January 2015. The timing of the missives appear to contradict a claim from her lawyers earlier this month, who in seeking to have released from jail on bond, told a judge that she\u2019d had no contact with Epstein in a decade.\n\nIn the emails, Epstein wrote to Maxwell that had \u201cdone nothing wrong\u201d and urged her to \u201cstart acting like it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe told her to \u201cgo outside, head high, not as an escaping convict,\u201d adding: \u201cgo to parties. deal with it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan have alleged that Maxwell recruited and groomed victims and participated in abusing them with Epstein. She was also charged with lying in a deposition in her lawsuit with Giuffre about whether she knew Epstein was having sex with minors. A judge has ordered that deposition also be made public, but Maxwell has appealed the decision.\n\nEpstein was arrested last year on federal sex trafficking charges for alleged abuses of underage girls in New York and Florida, but he died by suicide in a Manhattan federal detention center before he could stand trial.\n\nAD\n\nIn court documents that have been previously made public, Giuffre accused Epstein of requiring her to have sex with various wealthy friends, including famed defense attorney Alan Dershowitz and Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew. Both have vigorously and repeatedly denied her claims.\n\nAD\n\nIn the newly unsealed sworn testimony, Giuffre accused Maxwell of being a full participant in abusing girls who she estimated were aged 15 to 21. She said she observed Epstein and Maxwell have sex with so many girls that she would have difficulty naming many.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a blur of so many girls,\u201d she testified. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard for me to remember. And you have to understand we weren\u2019t introduced to each other on a first-name basis half the time. A lot of these girls would come and go and you\u2019d never see them again.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe described sexual encounters in the cabanas of Epstein\u2019s private island in the Caribbean and his Palm Beach and New York mansions. Maxwell, she said, also forced her to have sex during visits to France, where the British socialite also held citizenship.\n\nGiuffre testified that while Maxwell did not use physical force to compel sexual encounters, she told Giuffre repeatedly that she and Epstein were powerful and well- connected people whom she should not anger.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that any of the girls involved were truly willing participants doing it out of their own wanting,\u201d she testified. \u201cI believe we were all there for one purpose, and that was to keep Jeffrey and Ghislaine happy and to do our jobs, which was giving them erotic massages and keeping them pleased sexually.\u201d\n\nThe names of several people she said were involved or was asked about were redacted from the transcript. At times, the deposition session appeared to grow heated as Maxwell\u2019s attorneys quizzed her about her claims.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Laura Menninger, an attorney for Maxwell, pressed her further to identify instances where Maxwell gave her instructions to \u201cmassage\u201d one of their friends, Giuffre insisted that \u201cthey both directed me to do it. It was part of my training.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey both told me, you\u2019ve got tickets to go here. This is who you\u2019re meeting and this is what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nEpstein and Maxwell \u201cboth paid me and they both directed me,\u201d she said, using \u201cmassage\u201d as code for sex.\n\nShe recited an example which was \u201calong the lines\u201d of what Maxwell would say to her. \u201cWe\u2019re sending you to a gentleman. We want you to show him a good time. We want you to do exactly what you would do for Jeffrey to him \u2026 and to keep him happy,\u201d Giuffre recalled of Maxwell\u2019s standard marching orders.\n\nAD\n\nTranscripts of depositions by Maxwell in the Giuffre lawsuit were also expected to be released Thursday, but her lawyers have appealed a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Preska that orders them unsealed.\n\nMaxwell\u2019s lawyers accused Giuffre\u2019s side of leaking Maxwell\u2019s depositions to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, which is handling Maxwell\u2019s criminal case. The office also brought the sex trafficking case against Epstein last year.\n\nAD\n\nIn what Preska called an \u201celeventh-hour\u201d bid by Maxwell\u2019s lawyers, they argued Maxwell was duped into giving sworn testimony in the lawsuit, which was filed in 2015, on the basis that the records would never be shared with law enforcement.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/epstein-accuser-alleged-in-newly-unsealed-deposition-that-ghislaine-maxwell-was-his-partner-in-abuse/2020/07/31/62a13384-d2da-11ea-8d32-1ebf4e9d8e0d_story.html", "author": ["Rosalind S.

By Thursday, with both teams temporarily shut down, the Marlins were up to 17 players and two coaches testing positive.\n\nNo Phillies players have tested positive, and MLB has reported zero positive tests of any player, outside the Marlins, since July 24.

As the first game of the night, before the Lakers edged the Clippers 103-101 in the second, the Pelicans were happy to oblige. They lost their tightly contested season reopener to the Utah Jazz, 106-104, and Coach Alvin Gentry kept Williamson on the bench for the crucial final few minutes of the game.\n\nWilliamson, who didn\u2019t play in any of his team\u2019s three scrimmages after having to leave the NBA bubble due to a family matter, racked up 13 points in 15 minutes. The former No. 1 pick only played the first three or four minutes of every quarter, but there\u2019s a strong argument that the Pelicans (28-37) needed him down the stretch. (There\u2019s also a strong argument that he and the rest of New Orleans\u2019 defense wore down.) The Pelicans are battling to force a play-in tournament to the playoffs, meaning they need to be within four games of the eighth-place team in the West. They need every win.\n\nThis time around, it was Brandon Ingram who led the way with 23 points.\n\nThen again, perhaps Williamson-centric discourse doesn\u2019t wet the whistle. For the sports fan who lives for a touch of kismet, allow Jazz center Rudy Gobert to step in.\n\nGobert will always be remembered as the NBA\u2019s \u201cPatient Zero\u201d after he tested positive for the novel coronavirus and was the impetus for the league shutting down in March. On Thursday, he scored the first points of the first official game back and hit the free throws that sealed the Jazz\u2019s comeback win with less than seven seconds to play.\n\nPerhaps more significantly for the Jazz (42-23), Gobert and teammate Donovan Mitchell, who also tested positive on March 11, looked great working together against New Orleans. Reports of their frosty relationship swirled after the shutdown \u2014 Mitchell told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d he didn\u2019t speak to Gobert after assuming the big man had exposed his teammates to the virus \u2014 but Thursday, the pair played in tandem smoothly. Gobert had 14 points and 12 rebounds; Mitchell scored 20 points. Guard Jordan Clarkson led the team with 23 points off the bench.\n\nIf their local rivalry a possible preview of the postseason that piques interest most, the Lakers and the Clippers took things across the country and made it seem as though neither team had taken any time off.\n\nThe second game of the night looked like every other juicy matchup these teams have played this season, the first two of which were won by the Clippers, with the Lakers taking the past two. While the Clippers appeared more energetic and dynamic early on as the Lakers struggled to find their shots, Anthony Davis helped lift his team and LeBron James sealed the win. The Lakers center dominated with 34 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Guard Alex Caruso proved pivotal on defense late. But in the end, the victory came down to James.\n\nThe game felt like a shootout late in the fourth quarter with both teams trading three\u2019s Paul George tied the score at 101 with less than 29 seconds left. But James drove in the lane and tossed up a too-strong floater, caught his own rebound and tipped in a layup with 12.8 seconds to go, giving the Lakers the lead. He wasn\u2019t done yet \u2014 the 35-year-old then charged back on defense to both stop Kawhi Leonard from driving and keep George from getting one last good shot off.\n\nJames finished with 16 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. George led the Clippers with 30 points including six three-pointers. Leonard scored 28 points in the second thriller of the night.\n\nAs for the broadcasts themselves, the games looked great on TV. With virtual fans and masked sideline reporters conducting interviews at a distance, the viewing experience wasn\u2019t all that different. The quality gameplay and the league\u2019s varied story lines stood out above all else \u2014 even Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Charles Barkley and the \u201cInside the NBA\u201d crew on TNT brought their signature loopy banter that made the restart feel something akin to a normal night of basketball, at least for a few hours.\n\nWelcome back, NBA. It\u2019s good to see you again.\n\nComplete highlights and coverage below:\n\nLakers hold off Clippers, 103-101 The NBA\u2019s first night of regular season action since March 11 was an entertaining one, with two closely contested games, the second of which was won by the Los Angeles Lakers over the rival Clippers, 103-101. The Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis led all scorers with 34 points and LeBron James hit the game-wining shot, but it was the team\u2019s bench that was the deciding factor. The Clippers were without two key reserves, Lou Williams (quarantine) and Montrezl Harrell (personal issue). On the other hand, the Lakers are having to forge ahead without an important duo of their own in Rajon Rondo (broken hand) and Avery Bradley (opted out), thrusting the likes of Alex Caruso and Dion Waters into prominent roles. For one night, at least, Caruso and Waiters came through, as did Kyle Kuzma, who chipped in with 16 points off the bench. That helped offset solid performances by Clippers stars Kawhi Leonard (28 points) and Paul George (30 points). In the first game of the night, the Jazz nipped the Pelicans, 106-104. By Des Bieler AD AD\n\nLakers, Clippers trade runs in the second half It hasn\u2019t always been the prettiest basketball between the Lakers and Clippers, but it has been entertaining, in no small part because each team has proved resilient in the face of a major surge. After the Lakers took a 10-point lead with just over five minutes left in the second quarter, the Clippers went on a 26-5 run to gain an 11-point edge, 66-55, midway through the third. The Lakers then battled back with a 36-14 run of their own, giving them an 91-80 lead with less than eight minutes to play. Neither team really needs to win this game but both of the crosstown rivals surely would love to send a strong message with a win. By Des Bieler AD AD\n\nIdle Steph Curry sends his \u2018love\u2019 to NBA players in action Steph Curry and the Warriors are not in the NBA bubble, but the Golden State superstar sent warm wishes to players getting the NBA return underway in Kissimee, Fla. \u201cI love every one of my NBA brothers out there! Welcome back,\u201d Curry tweeted as a game between the Lakers and Clippers got underway, following a close win by the Jazz over the Pelicans that kicked off the league\u2019s restart to its 2019-20 season. The Warriors were among the eight worst teams in the league and thus not invited to the bubble. There was talk earlier this month of the NBA setting up a second bubble for that unfortunate octet, but Curry indicated then that he likely would not participate. Curry missed almost all of this season with a broken hand, returning just as the NBA paused its season in March to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. The Warriors, also missing Klay Thompson, had by then notched the league\u2019s worst record at 15-50. By Des Bieler AD AD\n\nClippers cut it close by halftime, Lakers lead, 54-52 The Clippers were behind by a dozen points early in the second quarter, but by the end of it they cut the Lakers\u2019 lead down to just two, 54-52. Clippers star Kawhi Leonard scored 14 of his team-high 19 points over that span and Paul George chipped in with 11 points in the first half. The Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis, who shook off an eye injury to score 14 points in the first quarter, had a total of 20 by halftime, while Kyle Kuzma had 10. The Lakers\u2019 LeBron James had just six points in the first half on 2-of-9 shooting, but he filled the stat sheet with game-leading totals in rebounds (six) and assists (five). Both teams shot poorly from three-point range, with the Lakers hitting three of 15 such attempts while the Clippers made four of 15.

Davis led all scorers in the first quarter with 14 points. He hit three of eight shots from the field and made all eight of his free throws, as the Lakers ended the opening frame with a 35-23 lead on the Clippers. Davis\u2019s fellow superstar on the Lakers, LeBron James, did not score at all in the first quarter, but he dished out five assists. Davis was poked in the eye during a scrimmage game Saturday. Davis missed a scrimmage game Monday and then a Lakers practice on Tuesday, but he said he was feeling better on Wednesday, when he returned to practice. Davis wore a protective mask for that practice, but he apparently felt so well on Thursday that he went mask-less, and proceeded to torch the Clippers in the early going.

Twenty-two of the league\u2019s 32 teams were invited to the bubble for the season\u2019s restart and they will play \u201cseeding games\u201d before the playoffs begin. With these games, teams can improve their playoff positions. Each team will play eight seeding games, as selected from its remaining regular season matchups. The first round of the playoffs begins Aug. 17, with conference semifinals starting Aug. 31. Conference finals start Sept. 15, with the NBA Finals getting underway Sept. 30.

By Cindy Boren AD AD\n\nNBA reportedly stocked lake at players\u2019 complex with fish It probably hasn\u2019t been like shooting fish in a barrel, but if some NBA players have been enjoying unexpected success of late at reeling in a few catches, there appears to be a reason. Early in the Thursday\u2019s Lakers-Clippers game, TNT reported that the league actually made sure to stock up a lake at the Disney complex near Orlando where the league\u2019s restart is taking place. The Clippers\u2019 Paul George has been among the players who have shared their fishing exploits on social media. The Mavericks\u2019 Luka Doncic has also been among those angling (ahem) for a reputation as an all-around sportsman. It\u2019s not like there is a whole lot else to do there, apart from golfing, or, if you are Clippers star Lou Williams \u2014 who is sitting out Thursday\u2019s game because he is back in quarantine \u2014 using some time away from the bubble to get chicken wings. By Des Bieler AD AD\n\nPelicans keep Zion Williamson on the bench down the stretch of close loss The Pelicans were apparently very serious about keeping Zion Williamson on a minutes restriction. The team\u2019s superstar rookie, who started the game but was expected to play in \u201cshort bursts,\u201d according to TNT, remained glued to the bench down the stretch of a 106-104 loss to the Jazz. That was the case despite the fact that his New Orleans squad was nip-and-tuck with Utah in the final few minutes of a game the Pelicans desperately needed to win to help their playoff chances. The Jazz grabbed the win in the NBA\u2019s first game of its restart to the 2019-20 season. Last year\u2019s No. 1 overall draft pick scored 13 points on 6-of-8 shooting over 15 total minutes on the court. New Orleans\u2019s Brandon Ingram and Utah\u2019s Jordan Clarkson led all scorers with 23 points each. The Pelicans shot better from three-point range (11-31) than the Jazz (8-34), Utah got to the line 10 more times and ended up hitting 11 more free throws.

The Compton Kids Club sang \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and players, like those from the Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans earlier, wore \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d shirts. They were joined in their demonstration by coaches and referees.

Kawhi Leonard has been off in scrimmages in Florida, and Montrezl Harrell has yet to return to the bubble after getting permission to leave to attend to a personal matter. Patrick Beverley has returned after being excused to leave the bubble because of a family emergency and Coach Doc Rivers said Beverley is a \u201cmaybe\u201d to play against the Lakers. Los Angeles Lakers (49-14): There couldn\u2019t really be a season opener without LeBron James, but, like the Clippers, there are a couple of personnel issues. The Lakers come into the game with the second-best record in the league (behind the Milwaukee Bucks) and a few concerns. Dwight Howard created a distraction when he questioned whether it was necessary to wear masks while inside the bubble. As for the on-the-court matters, Avery Bradley opted out of the rest of the season; Rajon Rondo is out after breaking his thumb in practice shortly after players arrived in Florida. Lakers Coach Frank Vogel said Anthony Davis, who was poked in the eye during a scrimmage earlier in the week, will play but he wasn\u2019t sure whether Davis would go with the goggles look.

The play in HP Arena inside the league\u2019s coronavirus bubble was ragged at times, but it tightened down the stretch, with the Jazz taking a 98-97 lead with just over 4 minutes left in the game. It was Utah\u2019s first lead since a 23-21 edge in the first quarter. That basket, by Donovan Mitchell, capped a 9-1 run. Zion Williamson, the No. 1 draft pick in 2019, had a sweet, behind-the-back bounce pass to Lonzo Ball was one of his best moments and might have been enough to satisfy fans thirsty for the resumption of sports. By Cindy Boren\n\nAdam Silver says players won\u2019t be punished for anthem protest NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Thursday night that members of the Pelicans and Jazz would face not punishment for taking a knee during the playing of the national anthem. \u201cI respect our teams\u2019 unified act of peaceful protest for social justice,\u201d Silver said, \u201cand under these unique circumstances will not enforce our long-standing rule requiring standing during the playing of our national anthem.\u201d That \u201clong-standing rule,\u201d which has existed since 1981, requires players, trainers and coaches to stand \u201cin a dignified posture\u201d during the playing of the anthem. The NBA opted not to change that in 2018, when it sent a memo shortly after training camps that reinforced that players would still be required to stand for the anthem. But it also offered several ways that teams could continue to create dialogue with players and their communities about the protest movement. \u201cNone of us operates in a vacuum,\u201d Silver and NBPA head Michelle Roberts said in the letter at that time. \u201cCritical issues that affect our society also impact you directly. Fortunately, you are not only the world\u2019s greatest basketball players \u2014 you have real power to make a difference in the world, and we want you know that the Players Association and the League are always available to help you figure out the most meaningful way to make that difference.\u201d By Cindy Boren\n\nJazz lead Pelicans by 12 at halftime The first basket of the NBA\u2019s restarted season went, perhaps fittingly, to Rudy Gobert, whose positive coronavirus test spurred the league to shut down the season in March. Also fitting, given that the league\u2019s decision to expand its rejiggered field to 22 teams enabled Zion Williamson to extend his rookie season, the NBA\u2019s most marketable young star made the second basket. After an emotional national anthem, the teams looked a little ragged from the months off and were playing without fans on a neutral court. But, with Williamson starting, New Orleans went on an 18-4 burst at the end of the first quarter for a 26-23 lead as the second quarter began. Utah fell behind early in the second but cut its deficit back to three before the young Pelicans went on another run, and they went to halftime with a 60-48 lead. New Orleans\u2019s Brandon Ingram led all scorers with 15 points on 6-of-11 shooting, while Williamson hit all four of his field goals en route to nine points. Mike Conley led the Jazz over the first two quarters with 14 points.

The singer did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post.\n\nIn March, Madonna began posting \u201cquarantine diaries,\u201d a series of short videos in which she reflects on the pandemic and the resulting shutdown.\n\nOne video Madonna posted \u2014 and later deleted \u2014 to Instagram and Twitter showed her sitting naked, save for an ornate necklace and bracelet, in a bathtub filled with a cream-colored liquid. Floating on the surface were rose petals, and at least seven small candles burned on one lip of the tub.

I love you, my queen. But things outside your mansion are very different from what you think. Stay safe and a be a little more empathic to the less privileged ones.\u201d\n\nIn another video, Madonna said that she wants \u201cso badly to be released from the bondage of giving a\u201d hoot, though she used a more vulgar term. Which, she quickly added, might now be the case because she \u201ctook a test the other day\u201d and \u201cfound out I have the antibodies, so tomorrow, I\u2019m just going to go for a long drive in a car, and I\u2019m gonna roll down the window, and I\u2019m gonna breathe in, I\u2019m gonna breathe in the covid-19 air.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI hope the sun is shining,\u201d she added.\n\nAD\n\n(Tests for covid-19 antibodies are still being studied.

In June 2019, Madonna released, as this reporter described at the time, \u201can eight-minute-and-21-second video for her anti-gun anthem \u2018God Control\u2019 that, with slick production values and borderline-cartoonish aesthetics, depicts a shooting in a night club, clearly meant to evoke the June 2016 massacre of 49 people at Pulse, a gay Orlando nightclub.\u201d", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/29/madonna-instagram-covid-coronavirus-stella-immanuel-bathtub/", "author": ["Travis M.

The Acting Secretary is committed to ensuring that all DHS personnel uphold the principles of professionalism, impartiality and respect for civil rights and civil liberties, particularly as it relates to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nSome of the leaked DHS documents the journalists posted and wrote about revealed shortcomings in the department\u2019s understanding of the nature of the protests in Portland, as well as techniques that intelligence analysts have used. A memo by the department\u2019s top intelligence official, which was tweeted by the editor of Lawfare, says personnel relied on \u201cFINTEL,\u201d an acronym for financial intelligence, as well as finished intelligence \u201cBaseball cards\u201d of arrested protesters to try to understand their motivations and plans. Historically, military and intelligence officials have used such cards for biographical dossiers of suspected terrorists, including those targeted in lethal drone strikes.\n\nThe DHS intelligence reports, which are unclassified, are traditionally used for sharing the department\u2019s analysis with federal law enforcement agencies, state and local officials, and some foreign governments. They are not intended to disseminate information about American citizens who have no connection to terrorists or other violent actors and who are engaged in activity protected by the First Amendment, current and former officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis has no operational value whatsoever,\u201d said John Sandweg, who previously served as the department\u2019s acting general counsel.\n\n\u201cThis will just damage the intelligence office\u2019s reputation,\u201d Sandweg said, calling the decision to report on journalists \u201cincredibly dumb.\u201d\n\nOfficials who are familiar with the reports, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss them, said they are consistent with the department\u2019s aggressive tactics in Portland, and in particular the work of the Intelligence and Analysis Office, which they worried is exceeding the boundaries of its authority in an effort to crack down on \u201cantifa\u201d protesters to please President Trump. He and other senior administration officials have used that \u201canti-fascist\u201d label to describe people in Portland and other cities who are protesting police violence, as well as others who have vandalized statues and memorials to Confederate officers that they consider racist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe reports reflect the intelligence office\u2019s concerns about leaks of internal information.\n\n\u201cTo broadly disseminate an intelligence report, including to numerous state and local law enforcement agencies, about a DHS leak to a reporter strikes me as bizarre,\u201d said Steve Bunnell, who served as the department\u2019s general counsel for three years in the Obama administration. If department officials were concerned about unauthorized disclosures, they should refer the matter to the inspector general or handle it internally, he said.\n\nDisseminating the information about internal leaks of this nature via the intelligence reports \u201chas nothing to do with DHS\u2019s original mission,\u201d Bunnell said.\n\nAD\n\nThe Intelligence and Analysis Office has for years been the butt of jokes among larger, more established agencies like the CIA and the FBI, who liken it to a team of junior-varsity athletes. The DHS office produces reports that are largely based on unclassified, often public sources of information that current and former officials have said are of limited use.\n\nAD\n\nDuring operations in Portland, the office has sought to expand its reach. Earlier this month, DHS personnel were authorized to collect information on protesters who threaten to damage or destroy public memorials and statues, regardless of whether they are on federal property, a significant expansion of authorities that have historically been used to protect landmarks from terrorist attacks, former officials said.\n\nThe intelligence reports about the journalists say they are \u201cprovided for intelligence and lead purposes\u201d and have \u201cbeen deemed necessary for the intended recipient to understand, assess, or act on the information provided.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne of the journalists, Times reporter Mike Baker, co-wrote an article on July 28 that revealed an internal DHS memo indicating that the camouflaged federal agents sent to put down the unrest in Portland didn\u2019t understand the nature of the protests they were facing.\n\nAD\n\nThe DHS memo described the conflict as connected to a years-long history of violence against government personnel and facilities in the Pacific Northwest by \u201canarchist extremists.\u201d But it acknowledged that \u201cwe have low confidence in our assessment\u201d when it comes to understanding the current protests in Oregon\u2019s largest city.\n\n\u201cWe lack insight into the motives for the most recent attacks,\u201d the memo said.\n\nAD\n\nBaker included an image of that portion of the memo in a Twitter thread that also linked to the Times article. The DHS intelligence report included that tweet and stated that Baker had posted \u201ca leaked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) internal product.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Times declined to comment.\n\nThe other journalist, Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the editor in chief of Lawfare, had also posted various internal documents to his Twitter feed, including, on July 24, a memo admonishing department personnel not to give information to reporters.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe ongoing leaks related to our work in Portland remain of great concern as it distracts from our mission and creates opportunities for others to exploit this information for their own benefit,\u201d the unsigned memo states.\n\nAD\n\nThe memo was written in response to reporting in Lawfare and The Washington Post days earlier about the new guidance to collect information on people who threatened memorials and statues. The memo defended the intelligence office\u2019s authority and said its work had \u201cinformed our analysis on the enduring threat environment [in Portland] and disrupted attempted violent attacks.\u201d\n\nWittes told The Post that he didn\u2019t object to the department expressing concerns about leaks and that if officials had sent a link to his tweet in a message to employees, he wouldn\u2019t object.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the sharing of my tweet that\u2019s disturbing. It\u2019s the construction of it as an intelligence report on a U.S. person that\u2019s disturbing,\u201d Wittes said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf the department was willing to document public statements this way, what would stop DHS from \u201cmaking a public record dossier on me?\u201d Wittes asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m considering my legal options and will have more to say about this at a later date,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a subsequent tweet that was also the subject of an intelligence report, Wittes posted an internal memo from Brian Murphy, the DHS acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis and a former FBI agent, announcing that officials were changing the terminology used for individuals attacking federal facilities. The decision, Murphy wrote, was based in part on the Open Source Intelligence Reports that officials had reviewed about protesters.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say any longer that this violent situation is opportunistic,\u201d Murphy wrote, adding that intelligence \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d led officials to believe that the attackers were driven by \u201canarchist\u201d and \u201cviolent antifa\u201d ideologies.\n\nMurphy\u2019s conclusions cut against the earlier DHS memo, which the Times reported, that said the department didn\u2019t have enough information to know whether the Portland protesters were connected to anti-government groups that had a history of operating in the region.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-compiled-intelligence-reports-on-journalists-who-published-leaked-documents/2020/07/30/5be5ec9e-d25b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html", "author": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter"]}, {"title": "With the words on their backs, NBA players take a stand", "text": "As the NBA resumed its season Thursday at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex outside Orlando, the absence of fans inside the league\u2019s bubble was far from the only noticeable difference.

The messages will be displayed above the number during the first four days of the season restart, after which players can choose to either simply go back to displaying their last name or keep both the social justice message and their last name on their jersey.\n\nPlayers were reportedly given the option of choosing from 29 messages, including \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d; \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d; \u201cJustice\u201d; \u201cPeace\u201d; \u201cEquality\u201d; \u201cSay Her Name\u201d; \u201cAnti-Racist\u201d; \u201cGroup Economics\u201d and \u201cI Am a Man\u201d \u2014 the slogan famously used in the 1968 Memphis sanitation workers\u2019 strike.\n\nNot every player chose to put a message on his jersey.

Trump suggests postponing the election.", "text": "In a country cleaved by political differences, paralyzed by a pernicious virus and suffering from a plunging economy, Thursday presented painful contrasts. It was a day of soaring tributes to the first Black lawmaker to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, offered from the pulpit of the mother church of the modern civil rights movement. And it was a day of pointed reminders that the nation is struggling, even after 244 years, to define itself, to decide what freedom and equality will mean.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNinety-six days before Americans select a path into an unknown and fearsome future, the nation\u2019s last four chief executives presented their visions of a country going through its toughest year in half a century.\n\nBarack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton put on masks and traveled to Atlanta\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church to say goodbye to a civil rights leader and Democratic House member who preached change, progress and hope. Donald Trump stayed home, spending the morning watching TV and tweeting, holding fast to his program of conflict, nostalgia and restoration.\n\nNot one of the three former presidents mentioned his absent successor, yet each seemed to have him very much in mind:\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJohn Lewis always looked outward, not inward,\u201d Bush said.\n\nClinton said that Lewis \u201cwas here on a mission that was bigger than personal ambition.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd Obama said of Lewis that \u201che believed in us even when we don\u2019t believe in ourselves.\u201d A few minutes later, to hit that note even harder, Obama said the very same words, one more time.\n\nThe former presidents deployed classic rhetoric \u2014 quotations from Scripture, powerful silences and sweet allusions to Lewis\u2019s grace and humility \u2014 to describe how he earned a respect, and therefore a power, for which others shout in vain.\n\nTrump turned to a classic, too \u2014 to his own lifelong quest to put himself at center stage.\n\nAD\n\nIn the morning, after his own administration reported discouraging data showing that the economy had tanked in recent months, contracting by a third on an annualized basis because the country had failed to get a handle on the coronavirus, the president scrambled to change the subject. Sixteen minutes after the grim numbers were released, he tweeted for attention \u2014 all grievance, all provocation, all CAPS.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history,\u201d he proclaimed with his 13,087th tweet since he became president. \u201cDelay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\u201d\n\nA funeral for one of the last of the great leaders of the civil rights movement of the 1960s was no place for campaign speeches, yet Trump and his barely-camouflaged disdain for the protesters who have filled American streets in recent months was a clear subtext for many of the eulogies at Lewis\u2019s memorial service.\n\nAD\n\nObama, in particular, made the point directly: \u201cBull Connor may be gone. But today we witness with our own eyes police officers kneeling on the necks of Black Americans. George Wallace may be gone, but we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators.\u201d\n\nBefore a socially-distanced congregation of 50 of Lewis\u2019s House colleagues and some of his fellow civil rights pioneers, all masked against the virus, Obama, Clinton and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called on Americans to honor Lewis\u2019s optimistic courage by \u201cnonviolently insisting on the truth,\u201d as Pelosi put it, and, above all, by voting.\n\nThe scene in the church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once was pastor was unusually universalist for a country so beset by division. Speakers paid tribute to Democrats and Republicans alike who had fought for civil rights. Obama praised both Bush and his father for signing extensions of the Voting Rights Act and hailed Lewis for sticking to his belief that he and his opponents shared a foundational belief in principles of equality and fairness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe must all keep ourselves open to hearing the call of love,\u201d Bush said.\n\nObama hit the same theme: \u201cIn all of us, there\u2019s a longing to do what\u2019s right.\u201d But sometimes, he added, that longing is \u201ctaught out of us. We start feeling as if, in fact, we can\u2019t afford to extend kindness and decency to people. And so often, that\u2019s encouraged in our culture.\u201d\n\nHe did not single out his successor in the White House, nor did he need to: Trump had been asked days earlier whether he would pay his respects to Lewis by visiting his casket in the Capitol Rotunda.\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be going, no,\u201d the president of the United States said, his lips tight.\n\nTrump has never been big on funerals. He showed up late and stood in the back at the service for one of the most important people in his life, his early mentor and attorney, Roy Cohn. At his own father\u2019s funeral, Trump spoke mainly of himself, listing his real estate projects and noting that Fred Trump had supported each one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe skipped the Capitol Rotunda honors for Sen. John McCain, the Republican leader and former prisoner of war in Vietnam, a national hero for whom Trump often expressed contempt.\n\n\u201cI gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted,\u201d Trump said after that service. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a thank you. That is okay. We sent him on the way, but I wasn\u2019t a fan of John McCain.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s speaking style might have seemed out of place at the Lewis funeral. But whether he stayed away because he knew he\u2019d be unwelcome or because he considered Lewis an enemy, Trump\u2019s absence was in character: He has always claimed to relish being on the other side, excluded by the establishment. Oppositional by nature, he was elected to be the great disrupter, and as president, he has often been at odds with his own government.\n\nAD\n\nBut although he was not in Atlanta, his deep, almost physical need to be the focus of attention, to lure the camera back to him, meant he was not about to sit quietly at the White House.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s suggestion that the November election be postponed because of the virus crisis seemed less than full-throated. He ended his tweet with question marks, a move he reserves for moments when he has perhaps gone too far, when his lunge for attention might backfire, or when, as in this case, his proposal might be illegal, on its face unconstitutional.\n\nTrump\u2019s gambit didn\u2019t win the usual plaudits. His dependable allies in Congress were not jumping off this particular cliff with their president. They could read the room, too.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNever in the history of the country, through wars, depressions, and the Civil War have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), \u201cand we\u2019ll find a way to do that again this November 3.\u201d\n\nTrump continued apace, tapping out tweets embracing a Long Island pizzeria owner who ticked off some of his customers by flying a Trump 2020 flag, and vowing to \u201cclear out . . . the Anarchists & Agitators in Portland.\u201d\n\nAs Obama spoke in Atlanta and on every major news channel, the president counterprogrammed by holding an unscheduled meeting in the Oval Office with the family of a soldier who was killed on an Army base in Texas. Spec. Vanessa Guillen\u2019s mother and sisters said Guillen was killed by a fellow soldier who had sexually harassed her. Trump called their story \u201cterrible\u201d and said he would \u201chelp\u201d with their funeral expenses.\n\nAD\n\nIn midafternoon, Trump paid tribute to Herman Cain, the former pizza chain executive and Republican presidential candidate whose death of covid-19 was announced Thursday. Cain had tested positive for the coronavirus days after attending \u2014 unmasked \u2014 a Trump campaign rally last month in Tulsa.\n\nBut Trump remained silent about Lewis, and by day\u2019s end, he was back to tweeting about the election: \u201cWe are going to WIN the 2020 election, BIG!\u201d\n\nJohn Lewis \u201cplayed the long game,\u201d a member of his congressional staff said at the funeral. He expected people to live up to their ideals. He saw in this spring\u2019s protests a new chance to bend the arc of history.\n\nIn a final note he left behind to be published on the day of his funeral, Lewis called on \u201cordinary people with extraordinary vision\u201d to \u201credeem the soul of America by getting in what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.\u201d He called the vote \u201cthe most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society,\u201d and he admonished Americans to \u201cstudy and learn the lessons of history. . . . The truth does not change.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLate in the day, Trump appeared at a hastily scheduled coronavirus briefing, where he rejected any move to shut down businesses to curb the virus.\n\nAsked how, in light of covid-19 cases spreading among Major League Baseball players, he could assure parents that it is safe for their children to return to school, the president had only this to say: \u201cCan you assure anyone of anything?\u201d\n\nTrump slammed his predecessors\u2019 \u201ccrazy, horrible, disgraceful \u201d trade deals, complained that the November election would be \u201crigged\u201d and made kind comments about Cain.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/three-presidents-embrace-the-struggle-for-rights-trump-suggests-postponing-the-election/2020/07/30/2ed52b02-d279-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html", "author": ["Marc Fisher", "Senior Editor Reporting On A Wide Range Of Topics"]}, {"title": "Documenting John Lewis\u2019s last public appearance", "text": "Photographer Gary Williams Jr. had been quarantining with his parents, his wife and their two young children in Virginia that first weekend of June when an unexpected message appeared in his email.

Lewis wanted to see it for himself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a personal moment,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe just wanted some photos to document his visit.\u201d\n\nThe plan was to go first thing in the morning, before the crowds. Just the three of them: Lewis, Collins and Williams, a 38-year-old co-founder of a Black-owned D.C. creative agency. But Williams wanted to give Lewis a bird\u2019s-eye view of the mural, and he had to enlist the help of friends in the mayor\u2019s office to get access to a rooftop that was otherwise closed because of the pandemic. The personal moment became more ceremonious.\n\nLewis had gone through a round of chemotherapy the day before, Collins told Williams, and he would be admitted to the hospital the following day. He leaned on a cane and wore a cap that read, \u201c1619\u201d and \u201c400 years.\u201d As he walked to the edge of the roof, everyone got quiet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything, and with his mask on it was hard to read his facial expression, but you could see it in his eyes that this was a moment of reflection,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd I kept saying to myself as I\u2019m taking these photos of him, \u2018I wonder what he\u2019s thinking.\u2019 \u201d (\u201cI just had to see and feel it for myself,\u201d Lewis wrote in an essay for the New York Times, published after his death, \u201cthat, after many years of silent witness, the truth is still marching on.\u201d)\n\nBehind the camera, Williams was having his own reflective moment. He\u2019d learned about John Lewis from his own parents, as they told him stories of racism they\u2019d experienced growing up in Virginia and Delaware in the \u201960s and \u201970s. His father, Gary Sr., told him about the time one of his friends dared to walk down a stairwell where the White students hung out. \u201cOne of the White gentlemen just punched him and knocked him out,\u201d says Williams, starting a near brawl. \u201cMy dad just told me that to share what he had to go through every day at school just to push through and get an education. That was the hostile environment he had to learn in.\u201d\n\nJohn Lewis had been beaten up regularly for entering White spaces: Attacked for entering a Whites-only area at a bus station in Rock Hill, S.C. Hit in the head with a wooden crate and left unconscious at another bus station, in Montgomery, Ala. Getting his skull cracked by police while marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., on \u201cBloody Sunday.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWilliams\u2019s mother, Chrystal, made sure her son read up on Lewis and other leaders of the civil rights movement, not just to know his Black history, but, he says, \u201cto know that there are folks who put their lives on the line so that life could be better for others.\u201d Selflessness, he says, was a lesson his parents were always trying to impart, that the world didn\u2019t revolve around him. \u201cAnd John Lewis made the ultimate selfless act,\u201d Williams said, \u201cbeing beaten within an inch of his life and deciding to get back out there and continue fighting for the civil rights movement.\u201d It was a lesson he hoped to teach his 2-year-old daughter and infant son when they grow old enough to understand. \u201cEven to this day my parents stress how important it is to continue to do the work,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s in-the-street protests or a simple act of voting.\u201d\n\nLewis said he wanted to walk on the plaza itself. Down on the street, people began to recognize him, including city workers who were maintaining the paint on the plaza. City workers driving by on a garbage truck stopped and let Williams and another photographer climb through the trash to the roof and take some overhead shots of Lewis. Lewis spent 45 minutes taking photos with the workers and anyone else who wanted one. People came up to thank him, or tell him that they loved him. When a reporter asked Lewis how he felt, he replied, \u201cThe people in D.C. and around the world are sending a powerful message that we will get there.\u201d\n\nWilliams kept it together as a professional until Lewis took a photograph with his 2-year-old daughter, Maevyn. His wife, Dvon, had been holding onto her the whole time, having broken their months-long isolation to tag along on the assignment, along with Williams\u2019s mom. (Gary Sr. had stayed in Virginia to watch Williams\u2019s 8-month-old son, Canon.)\n\nWhen Maevyn is old enough to understand, Williams plans to tell her who John Lewis was and what he did \u2014 not just for the country, but for Black people specifically \u2014 and what he proved possible: that \u201cif we can endure those hardships and challenges, there is light,\u201d Williams says. \u201cThere is progress on the other side.\u201d On the same day Lewis saw \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d painted on the streets of Washington he also met Maevyn, and Williams had been able to capture the moment when their lives briefly touched.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWilliams thought about Lewis\u2019s life and how he would explain it to his daughter. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for the life that he led, because if it wasn\u2019t for him, this Black Lives Matter movement now might not have been possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI will tell her that he fought for what he believed in and he did it courageously and he did it bravely, and I will tell her that we need to have that same kind of courage and bravery for the things that we stand for and the things that we believe in.\u201d\n\nHe imagined a photo of the two of them ending up in the National Museum of African American History and Culture, or in a textbook.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/documenting-john-lewiss-last-public-appearance/2020/07/30/0b1d2d04-cab3-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html", "author": ["Jada Yuan", "Feature Reporter Covering National Politics"]}, {"title": "No charges for former officer who killed Michael Brown; DHS compiles reports on journalists", "text": "PORTLAND, Ore \u2014 Two parks that had been at the center of protests here were cleared in early morning raids after another night of violence between demonstrators and federal officers.\n\nPortland police officers were guarding the parks by morning Thursday after they were cordoned off with yellow police tape.

Trump encountered unprecedented pushback to his idea from senior Republicans on the Hill and conservative leaders outside government, as well as legal scholars, historians and Democrats.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama, speaking at the funeral of the late civil rights icon John Lewis in Atlanta, alluded to the intensifying war over voting rights, saying that \u201ceven as we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their darndest to discourage people from voting.\u201d Obama, who has avoided public comments on much of Trump\u2019s presidency, did not specifically cite his successor\u2019s latest suggestion or mention him by name.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was among many Republican senators who quickly and unequivocally rejected Trump\u2019s idea. \u201cNever in the history of the country, through wars, depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time,\u201d McConnell said in a television interview with WNKY of Bowling Green, Ky. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump gave no indication that he would launch a serious push for the date change, or that he thinks he has the power to do so without congressional approval. But he appeared unfazed by the criticism.\n\nHe \u201cpinned\u201d the tweet in which he first floated the idea Thursday, fixing it to the top of his Twitter feed.\n\n\u201cWith Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history,\u201d he wrote in the message. \u201cIt will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\u201d\n\nAt a news conference late in the day, Trump said does not want to delay the election, but said the alternative is a \u201ccrooked election\u201d that could be take months or even years to resolve \u2014 suggesting he is prepared to contest the results if he loses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI want to have the election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also don\u2019t want to wait for three months and find out that all the ballots are all missing and the election won\u2019t mean anything. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, and everyone knows it.\u201d\n\nSeveral Trump advisers said no internal discussions were underway within the White House about moving the date. The tweet caught aides by surprise, said one senior adviser who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal conversation. \u201cHe is just trolling,\u201d said another.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution gives the power to regulate the \u201ctime, place and manner\u201d of general elections to Congress, while states control the dates of primary elections. Nowhere is the president granted such power.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition, the Constitution\u2019s 20th Amendment spells out a hard end to a president\u2019s and vice president\u2019s four-year terms on Jan. 20, whether an election is held or not.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe President has no power to change the date of the election,\u201d said Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California at Irvine. \u201cThis is yet another statement by the President which undermines voter confidence and that seeks without evidence to undermine the legitimacy of voting by mail.\u201d\n\nNo president has ever before tried to postpone a federal election, said historian Michael Beschloss. The idea was floated to President Abraham Lincoln in 1864, during the Civil War, and to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942, during World War II.\n\nAD\n\nLincoln said at the time that postponing an election because of the \u201cSouthern rebellion\u201d would mean \u201cour system has been defeated,\u201d while Roosevelt said doing so while fighting the fascists would mean \u201cwe have become fascists ourselves,\u201d Beschloss said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat tweet claims powers that he does not have, period,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is not a dictator.\u201d\n\nOne of the most dramatic critiques of Trump\u2019s tweet came from Steven G. Calabrese, a co-founder of the conservative Federalist Society, who wrote in an opinion piece published in The New York Times Thursday that the idea was \u201cfascistic\u201d and \u201cgrounds for the president\u2019s immediate impeachment.\u201d\n\nTrump has enjoyed full-throated support from conservatives and nearly all congressional Republicans; the Federalist Society, for instance, has cheered on and even helped select his Supreme Court nominations. That backing appeared to wobble on Thursday, with many Republicans not only alarmed by the president\u2019s apparent disregard for the limits of his power, but emboldened to say so in public.\n\n\u201cElection Day is and will be Nov 3, 2020,\u201d said Republican Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary to George W. Bush. \u201cMr. President \u2014 please don\u2019t even pretend to mess with this. It\u2019s a harmful idea.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdded Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) on Twitter: \u201cWe are not moving the date of the election. The resistance to this idea among Republicans is overwhelming.\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) weighed in similarly.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), meanwhile, simply tweeted the relevant passage from the Constitution granting Congress the power to set election dates. Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, told supporters at a virtual fundraiser Thursday that Trump was probably trying to steal attention away from Lewis\u2019s funeral.\n\nOther Democrats suggested that Trump\u2019s suggestion reflected a realization that he could lose to Biden, who has been leading in national and many battleground state polls.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is terrified,\u201d tweeted Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is among those being considered as a running mate for Biden. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s going to lose to @JoeBiden. It will require every single one of us to make that happen. We will see you at the ballot box on November 3rd, @realDonaldTrump.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome Democrats used the occasion to promote how-to instructions on mail balloting.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is talking about delaying the November election because he is afraid of people voting by mail,\u201d Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.) said in a tweet, in which she included a link to a Florida government website with instructions on how to do so. \u201cYou know what to do,\u201d she added.\n\nAD\n\nThe president of the American Postal Workers Union, Mark Dimondstein, also rebuked the president for undermining confidence in the U.S. Postal Service. He noted that there is \u201cessentially no fraud\u201d in mail balloting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous insult for the president be railing against vote by mail over and over and over and over, railing against the post office,\u201d Dimondstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to every postal worker and every customer who trusts the post office.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRonna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said on Fox Business that \u201cobviously\u201d the president understands that he doesn\u2019t have the authority to move the election.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Trump\u2019s tweet. Earlier this week at a House Judiciary Committee hearing, however, Attorney General William P. Barr told Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.) he had not studied the question of whether the president could move the election date.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been asked the question before. I\u2019ve never looked into it,\u201d Barr said.\n\nBiden suggested in April that Trump might try to move the election date. At the time, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh accused Biden of \u201cincoherent, conspiracy-theory ramblings\u201d and said the president \u201chas been clear\u201d that the election will happen on Nov. 3.\n\nAnother Trump campaign spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said in a statement Thursday that the president was merely \u201craising a question about the chaos Democrats have created with their insistence on all mail-in voting.\u201d\n\nIn fact, most Democrats are pushing for mail balloting in addition to early in-person and Election Day voting \u2014 not universal mail balloting, as Trump has alleged \u2014 because even though many voters have expressed a new preference for voting by mail because of fear of infection, many other voters remain more comfortable casting their ballots in person.\n\nTrump has argued that mail-in voting tends to hurt Republicans at the ballot box, but some Republicans worry that the president\u2019s own rhetoric is what\u2019s turning their own voters off of mail balloting.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted this month shows that 51 percent of Democrats prefer voting by mail this fall, compared with 20 percent of Republicans. A recent study by Stanford University researchers found no partisan impact of expanding voting by mail.\n\nAt the congressional hearing, Barr repeated his concern that he felt there was a \u201chigh risk\u201d that mail-in voting would lead to fraud, but said he did not believe the election would be rigged \u2014 seeming to break with Trump.\n\n\u201cI have no reason to think it will be,\u201d Barr said.\n\nEven if Congress voted to delay the general election, the electoral college is still required to elect a president under federal law.

In fact, immunologists have said that while children under the age of 10 are unlikely to transmit the novel coronavirus, children older than 10 can spread it as easily as adults.\n\nAD\n\nTrump also predicted a rapid economic recovery from the precipitous drop in employment and consumer spending caused by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI think next year\u2019s going to be an excellent year, maybe one of our best years ever from an economic standpoint,\u201d Trump said.\n\nJerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said any recovery depends on whether Americans are willing to embrace behavior that can beat back the virus.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe path of the economy is going to depend, to a very high extent, on the course of the virus and on the measures we take to keep it in check,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cSocial distancing measures and a fast reopening of the economy actually go together. They\u2019re not in competition with each other.\u201d\n\nTrump also used the coronavirus briefing to attack mail-in voting, hours after his Republican allies joined Democrats to rebuff his suggestion to delay the Nov. 3 election. Trump said he wants the election decided quickly, rather than drag on until millions of mail-in ballots are counted and determined to be legitimate.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see that take place in a week, after Nov. 3, or a month,\u201d he said. \u201cOr frankly, with litigation and everything else that could happen, it could take years. Years. Or you never even know who won the election.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump sounded more muted than combative, as the death toll continued to mount and experts warned of the potential of economic collapse.\n\nNationwide, 1,400 people infected with the coronavirus died Wednesday, the highest number since May. Several states, including Florida and California, reported record highs for deaths in a single day. More than 4.4 million cases have been reported in the United States, and nearly 150,000 people have died, according to The Washington Post tracker.\n\nAmong the deaths Thursday was well-known businessman turned politician Herman Cain, who sought the Republican nomination for president in 2012. He had attended a June 20 rally for President Trump in Tulsa, where he was photographed maskless in a crowd of others who were also without masks, but it was not determined whether that is where he contracted the virus.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmid mostly glum news, optimism was in short supply. Even though new infections have leveled off in some of the hardest hit states in the South, they are creeping up elsewhere, threatening to surge.\n\nThe trends prompted both administration insiders and public health experts to urge governments to act more aggressively.\n\nDeborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said states and localities should mandate wearing masks in public.\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox News, Birx said there remains a \u201cvery serious pandemic\u201d in Southern states. Despite signs of improvement, she added, the situation is deteriorating elsewhere.\n\n\u201cSo now we see the virus, probably because of vacations and other reasons of travel, moving up into Kentucky, Tennessee, southern Ohio, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, of course, we continue to have problems across the coast \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho and Utah, and now increases in Colorado.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBirx called for mandatory measures that Trump and many Americans have resisted, considering them alarmist and an infringement on their liberties.\n\n\u201cWe believe if the governors and mayors of every locality right now would mandate masks for their communities and [if] every American would wear a mask and socially distance and not congregate in large settings where you can\u2019t socially distance or wear a mask, that we can really get control of this virus and drive down cases as Arizona has done,\u201d Birx said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf the nation does not change its course \u2014 and soon \u2014 deaths in the United States could be well into the multiple hundreds of thousands,\u201d the organization said.\n\nAD\n\nThe Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security released a report Wednesday with 10 recommendations for action and another stark warning.\n\n\u201cUnlike many countries in the world, the United States is not currently on course to get control of this epidemic. It\u2019s time to reset,\u201d six scholars wrote.\n\nDespite the concerns over the rising death toll and economic impact, at least 17 of 21 states flagged as coronavirus \u201cred zones\u201d are not following all recommendations by the government\u2019s coronavirus task force.\n\nAD\n\nRep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), the chairman of the House\u2019s Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, which was formed to assess the Trump administration\u2019s response to the pandemic, wrote governors of several red-zone states urging them to heed experts\u2019 advice.\n\nThe recent task force report \u201crecommends far stronger public health measures than the Trump Administration has called for in public \u2014 including requiring face masks, closing bars, and strictly limiting gatherings,\u201d Clyburn wrote in a letter to Birx and Vice President Pence. \u201cYet many states do not appear to be following these unpublished recommendations and are instead pursuing policies more consistent with the administration\u2019s contradictory public statements downplaying the seriousness of the threat.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) on Thursday asked the state\u2019s liquor control commission to cut off alcohol sales at 10 p.m. each night. Any alcohol purchased by that hour would have to be consumed by 11.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) said his residents now must wear masks inside public buildings and businesses. The order \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d face coverings in other settings.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers in the state opposed the order, and court challenges to its constitutionality are expected. Elsewhere, some of the restrictions being imposed by local and state authorities are openly flouted.\n\nAlabama Republican Senate candidate Tommy Tuberville is fundraising and holding \u00adin-person meetings in Washington this week, defying orders from D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) that visitors from Alabama and other coronavirus hot spots quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.\n\nAD\n\nTuberville spent at least some of his time at the Trump International Hotel, according to a photo posted to Facebook by Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) showing the two men in the hotel lobby on Tuesday night. Neither man was masked.\n\nAlabama\u2019s coronavirus cases are surging, with more than 25 percent of its total cases appearing in the past two weeks, according to state data.\n\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) defiantly walked the halls of Congress maskless and wasn\u2019t practicing social distancing before he was told Wednesday he could not fly with Trump on Air Force One to Texas because he had tested positive for the virus.\n\nEven then, he returned to the Capitol, ignoring expert advice on how to avoid spreading covid-19 germs, and filmed a video questioning the effectiveness of masks. He even suggested he may have caught the disease from a mask.\n\nGohmert\u2019s mask skepticism spurred House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to order all lawmakers to wear a mask while appearing on the chamber floor.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/public-health-experts-issue-urgent-call-for-change-of-course-as-us-economy-tanks/2020/07/30/b38287aa-d297-11ea-af07-1d058ca137ae_story.html", "author": ["Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department"]}, {"title": "Stop turning retail workers into mask police, union leader says", "text": "Employers bear the responsibility to provide a safe workplace, said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, who called for companies to hire security staffers to enforce a store\u2019s mask policies or task members of management with the role.\n\n\u201cEmployees should not be expected to put their safety and their life on the line for the employer. That\u2019s an unreasonable expectation,\u201d Appelbaum told The Washington Post on Thursday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn some instances, the union has negotiated for the right of workers to bow out of interactions with unmasked customers without reprisal. Employees without such protections have little choice, he said, but to endure a risky working environment on the front lines of the culture war over mask-wearing.\n\nThe United States now has more deaths from the novel coronavirus than any other country. Yet despite the growing death toll and the strong consensus from health experts that masks are an effective way to slow the spread of the virus, masks are highly politicized.\n\nThe lack of a federal mask mandate stands in contrast with numerous countries that require masks in public.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, Americans are navigating a patchwork of regulations that vary by store, city and state. At least 30 states have instituted rules for wearing masks while shopping indoors. In states without mask requirements, people may still be required to wear one to shop in certain stores. As of mid-July, nine of the largest bricks-and-mortal retailers had announced mask rules.\n\nAD\n\nYet even among stores with mask policies, the rules are inconsistently enforced.\n\nRetailers such as Walmart and Kroger did not address enforcement in the corporate announcements of their mask policies. Representatives for both stores did not immediately respond to questions about enforcing their mask policy, though multiple reports indicate guests aren\u2019t being barred outright if they enter stores without a mask.\n\nAD\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s, with more than 500 stores across the country, has among the most strictly enforced safety requirements. If customers try to shop without a face covering, employees are expected to refuse them entry and ask them to return with a mask, Trader Joe\u2019s spokeswoman Kenya Friend-Daniel told The Post via email. But a customer who refuses to wear a mask and tries to force their way in creates a separate issue altogether: \u201cWe would handle it as we would anyone causing a disruption in our stores, up to calling the police,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nLike other retailers, Home Depot has a mask requirement supported by \u201csocial distancing captains,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t ban noncompliant customers for safety reasons, said Margaret Smith, a company spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cOur associates will offer masks to those who don\u2019t have one, but it\u2019s too dangerous to forcibly or physically deny entry,\u201d Smith told The Post via email. Smith said \u201cit\u2019s not unusual\u201d for the company to use third-party security at its stores but declined to give specifics about how security personnel are used.\n\nAD\n\nThe m\u00e9lange of rules means front-line workers are left to deal with customers who are confused, angry or simply defiant over mask orders. Viral videos regularly appear on social media showing ugly exchanges between massless customers and fellow shoppers or employees urging compliance, including a recent altercation at a Manhattan Trader Joe\u2019s when two customers not wearing masks went on a rampage in the store and attacked employees, according to police.\n\nAD\n\nIn several instances, the confrontations have even turned deadly. According to the gun violence tracking website the Trace, at least seven people have been injured and four people have died related to disputes over mask mandates.\n\nAppelbaum, the union leader, said some stores appear more worried about inconveniencing customers than about public health and called the lax enforcement coupled with the burden on workers \u201coutrageous.\u201d", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/30/stop-turning-retail-workers-into-mask-police-union-says/", "author": ["Kim Bellware", "Reporter Covering National Breaking News"]}, {"title": "Supreme Court again splits on coronavirus-related election issue", "text": "The justices put on hold a lower-court order that Idaho officials either put on the ballot an education initiative promoted by a group called Reform Idaho or allow the group to gather signatures electronically, although the deadline had passed.\n\nIt is unclear exactly how the court\u2019s vote broke down, although at least five of the nine justices had to agree with the action.\n\nAD\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. Three justices joined Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in explaining the action. But the order did not state how the other three justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer and Elena Kagan \u2014 voted, which sometimes happens when the court settles an emergency request.\n\nSotomayor said that her colleagues have become too quick to grant the requests of state officials in such challenges, sometimes even before lower courts had finished their work.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBy jumping ahead of the court of appeals, this court once again forgets that it is \u2018a court of review, not of first view,\u2019 \u201d she wrote, citing court precedent, and \u201cundermines the public\u2019s expectation that its highest court will act only after considered deliberation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had refused to put a district judge\u2019s order in the case on hold, but had said it would expedite its consideration of the matter.\n\nBut Roberts said the district court did not adequately consider the burdens its order placed on Idaho election officials, who are dealing with other issues involving the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe district court did not accord sufficient weight to the state\u2019s discretionary judgments about how to prioritize limited state resources across the election system as a whole,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAD\n\nHe added: \u201cThis is not a case about the right to vote, but about how items are placed on the ballot in the first place.

Load up all the food, luggage and gear you\u2019ll need for the duration of your trip, then head out into the watery wilderness.\n\nYou may see other boaters, but it\u2019ll be from a distance. Unless you need fuel, food or other provisions \u2014 unlikely if you\u2019ve planned ahead \u2014 you don\u2019t need to see anyone outside your boat for the duration of your holiday. And that isolation \u2014 being with a known group but being far away from everyone else \u2014 certainly has a newfound appeal in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having one of best years ever,\u201d says Bill Dougherty, co-owner of Rainy Lake Houseboats in International Falls, Minn. His family has run tourism ventures on the lake for 102 years and currently rents 27 houseboats.\n\nDougherty is particularly pleased that more families with young children are renting, partly as a result of summer sports and camps being canceled. Instead, he says, \u201cfamilies are out there having the time of their life. They leave everything behind, and no one tells them where to go or what to do.\u201d\n\nThat freedom, according to other houseboat purveyors, is a big part of the draw. Houseboating, says Robert Knowlton, general manager of Lake Powell Resorts & Marinas in Arizona, allows you to get out in nature and \u201cfind your own private piece of paradise.\u201d And the charms of that solitude are not just for families. Chad Taylor of Lake Mead/Mohave Adventures, says many a high-profile CEOs rent houseboats from his Nevada marina \u201cbecause they like to get out on the lake and hide out for a week.\u201d\n\nSo what does a group actually do while hiding out on a houseboat for a week? Activities depend on the whims of the body of water.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Rainy Lake, a glacially carved lake formed more than 10,000 years ago, houseboaters can motor during the day, though most choose to tie up at any of the first-come, first-served moorings on the U.S. side of the lake \u2014 Americans can\u2019t currently cross into Canadian waters \u2014 and spend their days exploring trails, playing on sandy beaches, and fishing, floating, swimming and birdwatching.\n\nMost of Dougherty\u2019s boats come with waterslides, and guests can rent or bring their own small motorboats, canoes, kayaks and stand-up paddleboards. He recommends boaters pick a different mooring every day, to see as many of the lake\u2019s bays, islands and rock formations as possible.\n\nOn Lakes Powell and Mead, the surreal desert and canyon landscapes of these dam-formed lakes tempts houseboaters to anchor on a sandy beach and use it as a base for exploration. Lake Mead\u2019s 550 miles of shoreline mean you can easily have a beach all to yourself and spend the week swimming or riding Jet Skis, and skiing, tubing and exploring with a smaller, tow-behind motorboat.\n\nOn Lake Powell, 2,000 miles of shoreline and the nearly 100 slot canyons of Glen Canyon lure hikers, while the lake allows motorized and nonmotorized watercraft. Kids, Knowlton says, are usually content to be in the water all day, tubing and \u201cgoing up and down the slides nonstop.\u201d He says families with older kids are wise to bring along footballs, Frisbees or a cornhole game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBroadcast journalist Kellie Burns-Garvey recalls a trip on Lake Powell with 14 family members ages 2 to 75. The kids loved the waterslide, and adults had time to relax. In a week, she says, \u201cwe swam, explored rock formations, and never really saw anyone else.\u201d\n\nA more tropical experience awaits on Florida\u2019s St. Johns River. Houseboaters who rent from Holly Bluff Marina in DeLand, located northeast of Orlando, can motor within a 50-mile radius of the marina, and discover abundant wildlife, clear springs suitable for swimming and snorkeling, and even some riverside restaurants. Boaters usually anchor on the water, as the river shoreline typically has dense vegetation \u2014 as well as the occasional alligator.\n\nOther than on Florida\u2019s reptile-rich riverbanks, campfires on the beach and stargazing are the prime after-dark activity for houseboaters. Las Vegas food stylist Roni Fields-Moonen, who spent a Thanksgiving houseboat vacation on Lake Mead, said most evenings consisted of \u201cbonfires, marshmallow roasts and singalongs.\u201d\n\nThough amenities vary from vendor to vendor, houseboats generally come equipped with everything you would find in a typical vacation rental, including cooking gear and all or most linens, plus safety equipment and a ship-to-shore radio with 24-hour emergency support. Fuel is charged based on consumption \u2014 boats leave the dock with a full tank and you only pay for what you use. Towable skiffs, Jet Skis (not legal on all waterways), kayaks and other toys are extra.\n\nBoaters need to bring their food, clothes and recreation gear. Food, especially, requires planning, since there are no grocery stores in the middle of wilderness areas. Fields-Moonen and her husband, Rick, a professional chef, packed coolers full of carefully labeled groceries, including a whole turkey they roasted in the boat\u2019s ample kitchen. With 10 mouths to feed, meals had to be planned down to the last ingredient, and Fields-Moonen recalls a lot of cooking and cleaning and that \u201cfood took up more space than luggage.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHouseboats can range from basic to luxury. Burns-Garvey says their Lake Powell boat was \u201clike a camper \u2014 not luxurious but comfortable enough,\u201d while Fields-Moonen and her group rented a deluxe model with a hot tub, five bedrooms, satellite TV and room on the top deck for morning yoga and Pilates sessions.\n\nPiloting the boats is straightforward and some marinas, like Lake Powell, offer piloted service in and out of the marina. \u201cWe rent all the time to first-time boaters,\u201d Knowlton says. Apart from the rare afternoon thunderstorm, weather is seldom a factor. Still, he says, boaters should keep an eye on the forecast \u2014 though the marina will radio if there are any serious weather concerns. On both Lakes Powell and Mead, purveyors advise that in a week\u2019s time, it makes sense to move the houseboat no more than two times, largely because anchoring is labor-intensive and time-consuming.\n\nPrices for houseboats naturally depend on the size, the season and the number of bells and whistles. At Rainy Lake, cozy two-person \u201choneymooner\u201d models rent for $1,380 a week in peak summer while deluxe 54-foot, 12-person boats with hot tubs rent for $5,795 in the same period. A four-person houseboat from Holly Bluff Marina in Florida rents for $1,500 in high season. The marina\u2019s most deluxe boat, a 60-foot model with four bedrooms and two bathrooms, rents for up to $3,400 for a week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrom Lake Mead/Mohave Adventures, a 59-foot, 10-person houseboat rents for $5,269 in high season, while a mammoth 70-foot model with a wet bar, hot tub and multiple satellite TVs is just over $8,000 a week. Lake Powell Resorts & Marinas rents 46-foot, economy houseboats for up to six guests for about $2,500 a week from June through August. Its top-of-the-line, 75-foot Odyssey model sleeps up to 16 people in 2,400 square feet of cabin space across three levels. In high season, it\u2019s $15,000 per week. Everything\u2019s bigger out west, after all, and houseboats are no exception.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/aboard-rented-houseboats-vacationers-take-to-the-water-at-a-safe-distance/2020/07/30/1b43dd16-d050-11ea-8d32-1ebf4e9d8e0d_story.html", "author": ["Elizabeth Heath"]}, {"title": "These travelers had been to almost every country in the world. Then came the coronavirus.", "text": "Then the coronavirus hit, rapidly closing borders and shutting down worldwide travel.\n\nNow the 48-year-old from Las Vegas doesn\u2019t know when, if ever, he\u2019ll accomplish his dream of visiting every country in the world.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was going to be my last chance for a while, as my wife just had our first child,\u201d McCaughey explained, adding that it\u2019s impossible to predict which countries will reopen their borders and when.\n\nAD\n\nHad McCaughey visited Syria this spring as planned, he would have joined a small coalition of travelers who can claim that they\u2019ve been everywhere in the world. Harry Mitsidis, founder of NomadMania, a group that tracks and verifies those who engage in competitive travel, said its database lists roughly 250 people who have earned that distinction (some of whom are now deceased).\n\nThis style of exploration had exploded in popularity over the past couple of decades, until the novel coronavirus effectively cut off its trajectory. In 2000, it was believed that only 12 people had ever ventured to every U.N. country. But in 2019 alone, at least 39 people set foot in their last country. They nearly double the 2018 number (and make up nearly 16 percent of the cumulative total).\n\nAD\n\nMitsidis credits three conditions for rising interest in \u201ccountry counting\u201d: the increasingly widespread openness of borders, decreased costs of travel because of greater infrastructure, and a new wealth of networks and support for those keen on joining the 193er club.\n\nAD\n\nBetween January and early March, nine people accomplished the feat, so it\u2019s likely that 2020\u2019s total would have been greater than the preceding year\u2019s. However, it\u2019s unlikely more finishers will be added to the list in 2020.\n\nSam Hawthorne, a 24-year-old explorer from Britain, also would have finished in April, making him the youngest man to ever pull off the round-the-world triumph. For now, he\u2019s staying in Tonga.\n\nWhen he was offered a repatriation flight, he declined. His final few countries are largely in the Pacific, and he\u2019d hoped a travel bubble would open up between the neighboring nations. Now the odds that he\u2019ll defeat the current record holder by the October deadline look slim.\n\nTraveling pair Rachel Davey (a 40-year-old from Australia) and Martina Sebova (a 39-year-old from Slovakia) are also competing for titles, though theirs are less time sensitive. When they wrap up, they\u2019ll be the first women from their respective countries of birth to do the loop. For them, helping to diversify a list made up of predominantly White, European men is what drives them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRealizing that left us with a bigger purpose: to inspire other women travelers,\u201d Sebova said, adding that she hopes the one takeaway others learn from their story is that the denizens of the world are largely good and that it\u2019s not as dangerous to travel around the world as one might think, even if you have two X chromosomes.\n\nAt present, they\u2019re missing nine countries, though they include the U.N. observer states (the Vatican, which they\u2019ve been to, and the Palestinian territories, which they have not) in their count.\n\nAustralia, where Sebova and Davey are currently based, has a ban on its residents leaving the country, even if other countries open up. Sebova said they hope to be able to finish their journey in 2021.\n\nAD\n\nBut even when they are able to leave, it will take months to replan. It took six months alone to get the paperwork approved and the mandated local guides hired for Libya, one of their few remaining nations. In early March, they were transiting through London en route to what would have been their 187th country and debating whether it was wise to go. \u201cLuckily we didn\u2019t have to make that decision. It was made for us,\u201d Sebova said.\n\nTo reach Libya, they needed to fly first to next-door Tunisia. Right before they would have departed, Tunisia enacted a 14-day quarantine for all arrivals, effectively closing the door on Libya and sending them home to Australia. By the time they\u2019ll be able to go again, their visas will have expired, and they\u2019ll have to start the process over.\n\nAD\n\nLike most other prolific country collectors, they said the most challenging aspect of their pursuit is logistics, particularly juggling visas (a process Hawthorne called \u201cunpredictable and opaque\u201d) and booking infrequent flights to rarely-traveled-to countries. People with this goal almost need to like planning travel as much as they enjoy partaking in it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt gets very challenging once you get down to having only a few [countries] left, because there\u2019s generally a reason why you haven\u2019t been there,\u201d McCaughey said. \u201cWhich ones are the most difficult are constantly changing. Angola was considered to be one of the most difficult because they weren\u2019t issuing tourist visas, but now they have electronic passes, and it\u2019s significantly easier. On the other hand, Iran and Pakistan have become more challenging.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the least-visited countries are planning to stay closed indefinitely. Island nations Kiribati (in the central Pacific) and Comoros (off Africa\u2019s east coast in the Indian Ocean), which are the second- and eighth-least-visited countries, are both closed until further notice. While extreme travel has always presented innumerable obstacles, a new one travelers will have to grapple with is whether it\u2019s still in their best interest.\n\nDrew Binsky has perhaps the most riding on his final countries: Saudi Arabia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Jamaica, Palau and Ghana. He was planning to film a 90-minute documentary with a production team from Los Angeles about his experiences in all of them. The 29-year-old, who produces short travel-related videos to his social media channels, is hoping to leverage his documentary and social media fame into a role as a TV travel host.\n\nWhile Binksy is eager to resume his quest as soon as possible (he\u2019s eyeing spring 2021 as a possibility), others, like Gina Morello, a 49-year-old from Dallas, aren\u2019t as sure. After years of planning, she\u2019s four countries short and had been slated to finish in June.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou have this ethical challenge of, \u2018Well, I can go to visit this other country, but do I really want to take up their resources, especially if they\u2019re having a difficult time?\u2019 \u201d Morello said. \u201c \u2018Should I really go there in absence of a [coronavirus] vaccine or rapid testing available?\u2019 Those are the things going through everyone\u2019s head right now.\u201d\n\nWhile Sebova thinks extreme travel will become more niche in a post-coronavirus world, she doesn\u2019t anticipate it stopping.\n\n\u201cThere will still be people who will try even if it is more challenging,\u201d Sebova said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason people do it, because it isn\u2019t easy, because not everyone can do it. We enjoy that challenge.\u201d", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/these-travelers-had-been-to-almost-every-country-in-the-world-then-came-the-coronavirus/2020/07/30/f46b8b8c-d101-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html", "author": ["Bailey Berg"]}, {"title": "New movies to stream this week: \u2018The Hater,\u2019 Lee Grant documentaries and more", "text": "\u2014 Michael O'Sullivan\n\nLee Grant will be the first to tell you she\u2019s a woman of nearly insatiable appetite. Her acting career nearly fatally interrupted by being blacklisted in the 1950s and 1960s, Grant came roaring back and, to quote the title of her memoir, said yes to everything. Eventually, that included directing, and since the 1980s she\u2019s made a string of candid, politically engaged documentaries that have proven to be astonishingly prescient. The six-film program \u201c20th Century Woman: The Documentary Films of Lee Grant,\u201d beginning July 29 and running through Sept. 9, includes the highlights of Grant\u2019s nonfiction career, including the Oscar-winning \u201cDown and Out in America\u201d (1986), about Reagan-era poverty and alienation that feels queasily of-the-moment; \u201cThe Willmar 8\u201d (1981), a stirring account of a tiny band of women who dared to fight for their rights against the small-town Minnesota bank where they worked; and \u201cWhat Sex Am I?\u201d (1985), a compassionate portrait of transgender men and women that, archaic language aside, was decades of its time.

His tweet landed just minutes after news broke that the economy contracted a stomach-churning 9.5 percent during the second quarter of the year, the largest such drop on record; meanwhile, jobless claims hit 1.4 million last week. There will be no V-shaped recovery.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut to understand Trump\u2019s motives does nothing to lessen the outrageousness of his suggestion. The law instructs, and history underlines: We do not postpone presidential elections in this country \u2014 certainly not by presidential fiat. In any event, unless Trump is reelected, the Constitution provides that he will cease being president at noon on Jan. 20.\n\nThe solution to the challenge of conducting an election in the midst of a pandemic, and with states potentially unprepared to cope with the deluge of mail-in ballots, is to take whatever steps necessary, and provide whatever funds might be needed, to ensure that as many votes as possible are counted, quickly and securely. Fanning the flames of public doubt about the legitimacy of an election that he has not yet lost may be among the most unpresidential of Trump\u2019s many unpresidential \u2014 indeed, unpatriotic \u2014 acts.\n\nYou could, perhaps, take some solace in the fact that Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans popped his trial balloon \u2014 and with astonishing rapidity, given their ordinary cowering from any risk of incurring presidential wrath. \u201cNever in the history of the country, through wars, depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time, and we\u2019ll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told WNKY television in Bowling Green. \u201cNever in the history of the federal elections have we not held an election, and we should go forward,\u201d said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, to feel grateful for such morsels of resistance and sanity only underscores how little we have come to expect of Republican lawmakers. It would be too much, no doubt, to expect them to expound on the dangers of Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the legitimacy of the election. But if they believe the election should proceed, maybe they could appropriate the money needed to ensure it does so properly?\n\nApparently not. The coronavirus package just released by Senate Republicans includes no new funding \u2014 zero \u2014 for state and local officials to hold elections. \u201cWe\u2019ve already appropriated an awful lot of money for election assistance,\u201d McConnell sniffed, referring to the $400 million allocated to election help in March. House Democrats would provide an additional $3.6 billion. If the situation is as dire as their president suggests, you might think Republicans could dig a little deeper.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions would have been troubling on any day \u2014 they were especially despicable on this one, as Rep. John Lewis, who risked his life to secure the right to vote, was laid to rest. Lewis\u2019s funeral presented a poignant contrast between Trump and his predecessor, Barack Obama, one that served to diminish Trump even more.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nObama, eulogizing Lewis, used the pulpit as the Democratic Georgia congressman would have wanted: to argue for renewed devotion to the work he had left unfinished.\n\n\u201cWe may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar in order to cast a ballot,\u201d Obama said, \u201cbut even as we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election that\u2019s going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don\u2019t get sick.\u201d\n\nAnd so Obama ticked off a national to-do list: First, revive the Voting Rights Act, gutted by the Supreme Court, and undo the \u201cflood of laws designed specifically to make voting harder,\u201d laws that represent \u201can attack on our democratic freedoms\u201d in their effort to suppress the votes of a growing minority population. Obama also called for automatic voter registration; voting rights for released felons; expanded early voting; a national holiday for Election Day; and representation for the citizens of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd if all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that\u2019s what we should do,\u201d Obama said, a first for him in public.\n\nTrump\u2019s name never crossed his lips; Trump\u2019s tweet went unmentioned.

President Abraham Lincoln thought he was likely to lose the election to former general George McClellan, who proposed ending the war with slavery intact. Lincoln was so gloomy about his chances that he wrote a memo to his Cabinet, to be unsealed only after Election Day, that assumed he had lost. (He urged his officials \u201cto save the Union between the election and the inauguration, as [his opponent] will have secured his election on such ground that he can not possibly save it afterwards.\u201d) Last-minute military victories, especially the Army\u2019s capture of Atlanta, swung support toward Lincoln.

The first widespread use of absentee ballots let Union soldiers vote, providing Lincoln\u2019s margin of victory.\n\nAD\n\nTwo days after his reelection, Lincoln spoke to a crowd serenading him at the White House.

A second wave emerged near Boston in September. The campaign was intense: World War I was still underway, some women were voting for the first time and \u201cdry\u201d candidates were making a hard push for prohibition.\n\nLocal and state authorities sought to maintain the integrity of the election while protecting public safety. Health officials in D.C. decided to reopen churches, schools and theaters shortly before the vote. In San Francisco, health officials mandated in October that people wear face masks while in public or in groups of two or more. All poll workers and voters were required to wear masks on Election Day, prompting the San Francisco Chronicle to call it \u201cthe first masked ballot ever known in the history of America.\u201d Still \u201cin most places the election was held with relatively few complications,\u201d one study later concluded.\n\nAD\n\nDuring World War II, many voters were overseas or away from home. In 1942, with strong support from first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Congress passed the Soldier Voting Act, allowing service members to vote absentee in federal elections and helping states send them ballots. This bill was delayed by Southern opposition because it did not require soldiers, White or Black, to pay the notorious poll tax. In 1944, Congress amended the Soldier Voting Act well ahead of voting, allowing states to simplify the process. Eventually, this legislation helped at least 2.6 million soldiers cast ballots \u2014 enough to make a difference in that year\u2019s contentious presidential election.\n\nAD\n\nDecades later, fears were rampant about a terrorist attack in 2004, the first presidential election held after 9/11. A terrorist attack in Madrid that spring was seen as an effort to influence Spain\u2019s elections. The House of Representatives made clear that U.S. voting would not be delayed. By a vote of 419 to 2, it declared that \u201cthe actions of terrorists will never cause the date of any Presidential election to be postponed,\u201d and that \u201cno single individual or agency should be given the authority to postpone the date of a Presidential election.\u201d Rep. Robert W. Ney (R-Ohio) said, \u201cElections are postponed in countries that have dictators by one individual. We do not operate that way.\u201d\n\nToday, Congress can help ensure safe, reliable elections by providing funds to states to support significantly expanded voting by mail, early voting and Election Day polling. Already, Congress allocated $400 million toward elections in the Cares Act, but much more is needed. The House-passed Heroes Act includes ample aid, and it\u2019s urgent that the next stimulus include election support.\n\nAD\n\nWe also have to accept that this year, it is likely to take days, not hours, to tally the results.\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s call for postponement, like something out of an authoritarian handbook, aims to undermine confidence in election results. Consider what a break that is with presidents past: Lincoln thought he would lose in 1864 yet carried on. Woodrow Wilson and the Democrats knew the 1918 vote could bring a setback, as midterms often do. (Indeed, Republicans won back the Congress.) In the 1940s, the opposition party gained seats in each election.\n\nAll of those votes were held. Americans understood that regular elections, set by statute and authorized by the Constitution, are at the heart of our democracy.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/30/trumps-call-postpone-elections-breaks-with-american-faith-democracy/", "author": ["Michael Waldman", "Harold Ekeh"]}, {"title": "Herman Cain made his own way, on his own terms", "text": "Herman Cain, a businessman turned politician turned commentator, was a pioneer, a leading member of the bridge generation of African Americans who brought the nation out of legally sanctioned segregation. He also belonged to the much smaller cohort of politically conservative African Americans, lonely ground he shared with such figures as economist Thomas Sowell and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In this, Cain represented a civil right sometimes neglected in the national discourse: the right of Black Americans to intellectual diversity.\n\nCain died on Thursday at an Atlanta-area hospital of complications caused by covid-19. He was 74.\n\nIn Cain\u2019s case, the bridge he built led from his father\u2019s version of corporate success to something more like equality. In segregated Atlanta, Black achievement was often measured by the prestige of the people one served. Luther Cain, during the 1960s and early 1970s, served as full-time chauffeur to Robert Woodruff, the head of Coca-Cola and arguably the most powerful man in town.\n\nDriving Woodruff allowed the elder Cain to send his whip-smart son to Morehouse College, the all-male school that \u2014 along with its all-female counterpart, Spelman College \u2014 educated Atlanta\u2019s Black elite. Cain majored in mathematics, then earned a master of science degree from Purdue University in the cutting-edge field of computers. He graduated in 1971, just as corporate America was half-heartedly integrating.\n\nWith the mind of a numbers-cruncher and the personality of a salesman, Cain made the most of the new opportunities. At Pillsbury, in his early 30s, he earned responsibility over some 400 restaurants in the Burger King chain. His focus on service and efficiency boosted the top and bottom lines. In 1986, the food conglomerate charged him with rescuing its floundering Godfather\u2019s Pizza operation.\n\nCain and a partner later bought the pizza chain from Pillsbury. It was a remarkable achievement for the son of a rich man\u2019s chauffeur from Jim Crow Georgia. Still in his early 40s, Cain had reached the top of a company whose brand was a household name. The shame is that too few African Americans moved up the corporate ladder behind him. A recent study reported that, even now, only 3.2 percent of senior leaders of large American corporations are Black.\n\nThe second phase of Cain\u2019s career \u2014 as a small-government, low-tax public policy maven \u2014 began with his service on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, then accelerated when he was elected president of the National Restaurant Association. Cain energized the sleepy trade association by helping to lead opposition to the Clinton administration\u2019s proposed overhaul of the health-care industry. That work caught the attention of Jack Kemp, an apostle of fiscal conservativism \u2014 and also a former NFL quarterback and member of Congress \u2014 who invited Cain to join a commission on tax reform.\n\n\u201cThe Colin Powell of American capitalism,\u201d Kemp dubbed his friend. Cain\u2019s work at the restaurant association and on the Kemp Commission made him prominent among Washington lobbyists; it was also the part of his life that produced several accusations of sexual harassment. And those ultimately torpedoed Cain\u2019s long-shot 2012 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, just as he was picking up unexpected momentum. Many White voters were intrigued by Cain\u2019s success in business and his simplified tax plan \u2014 \u201cthe 9-9-9 Plan,\u201d featuring a lower income tax and a new federal sales tax. But with only about 6 percent of Black Americans identifying as Republicans in 2012, and the Black cultural elite overwhelmingly liberal, Cain lacked a base of support on which to build.\n\nAs a survivor of aggressive colon cancer, Cain might have paid more attention to public health warnings about the novel coronavirus. But there he was last month in Tulsa, at a rally for President Trump, his smile visible, his mask nowhere to be seen. Perhaps by then, going against the grain was so deeply etched that it had become a self-defeating habit. That he was able to make his own way on his own terms, however, was a legacy worth leaving.\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Von Drehle: John Prine was a rare poet of American song\n\nDavid Von Drehle: Gil Bailey brought the music of the Caribbean to the airwaves\n\nJennifer Rubin: Trump\u2019s racist housing tweet is par for his family\n\nTimothy Searchinger: I\u2019ve eaten at restaurants, gone to a mall and attended concerts.

Maybe not.

How hard it must have been to keep all of that down when Trump\u2019s foreign policy adviser, national security adviser, campaign chairman, deputy campaign chairman, personal lawyer, political consultant and attorney general were all busted for lying to federal investigators or Congress about their contacts with Russians. But you still kept your head down and marched in a single formation behind Trump.\n\nWhen it was revealed that Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign was \u201csweeping and systematic,\u201d you shrugged your shoulders.

That section of the law required federal agencies that deal with housing and banking to pursue their missions in a way that would actively desegregate housing. In 2015, the Obama administration spelled out how communities should measure their progress, or lack thereof, in eliminating housing bias, and tied federal funding for housing and urban development to those measurements.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet is a promise not to actively enforce that provision. And it\u2019s a message to White people they can go ahead and do whatever they feel is necessary to keep Black people and Latinos from moving into their neighborhoods.\n\nLook at how he delivers that message. He uses the words, and assumes the context, of the era when the Fair Housing Act was passed \u2014 a time of \u201cwhite flight\u201d from the inner cities to the suburbs. He uses \u201clow income housing\u201d as not-so-coded language for \u201chousing occupied by people of color,\u201d and his meaning is clear. White Americans, your property values would suffer if an African American or Latino family were to move in next door. There would be more crime, because, well, you know how those people are. But don\u2019t worry. Barack Obama wanted to make you let them in, but I\u2019ll keep them out.\n\nAt a moment when the Black Lives Matter protests have sparked a debate on how to eradicate systemic racism, Trump vows to keep it alive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis attack on desegregation should come as no surprise. Trump\u2019s first appearance in the public eye came in 1973, when he, his father and their real estate company were sued by the Justice Department for refusing to rent apartments to African Americans. Rather than quietly reach a settlement, as other developers had done, the Trumps filed a ridiculous $100 million countersuit and accused the federal government of forcing them to accept \u201cwelfare recipients\u201d as tenants. In the end, the Trumps agreed to a consent decree in which they promised to stop discriminating against minorities without admitting they had been doing so.\n\nThis racist mind-set about housing is fully in keeping with the tenor of his inflame-the-base reelection campaign, in which he has demonized racial-justice protesters as \u201canarchists\u201d and \u201cagitators\u201d while cheering, for example, the White couple in St. Louis who pointed guns at demonstrators marching past.\n\nTrump\u2019s reflexively racist views might not have changed over the years. But the nation has.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor one thing, the suburbs are far from lily-white. According to studies by the Brookings Institution, the racial demographics of America\u2019s suburbs now roughly mirror those of the nation as a whole. In some metropolitan areas, more African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans are \u201cliving their Suburban Lifestyle Dream\u201d (as Trump put it) than are living in the core cities.\n\nAt the same time, however, patterns of racial segregation in housing persist, including in many suburbs. Segregation in housing leads to segregation in schools, which helps perpetuate structural disparities. The fact that a given house in a White suburban neighborhood tends to be assessed at a higher value than an identical house in a comparable African American neighborhood helps maintain the massive wealth gap between Black and White people. A serious federal effort to \u201caffirmatively\u201d reduce segregation would help lessen inequality.\n\nMost Americans see this as a moment of racial reckoning, according to polls. Trump has also fallen behind with suburban voters, who have become a key electoral bellwether. In response, Trump promises his followers a return to the racial caste system that stratified the nation before the civil rights movement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt least the president is up front about all of this. The Republican Party cannot pretend there is anything at work here other than old-fashioned racism. Those who support Trump\u2019s reelection must also support, and cheer, his adamant refusal to enforce a landmark piece of civil rights legislation.

But the Constitution actually makes the office weak by design, giving it among the most limited set of powers of any head of government in the world. Preeminent scholar Richard Neustadt noted that to get anything done, the president \u201chas to use whatever influence he does possess on Congress, agencies, the media, state governments, private interests, foreign allies, and public opinion abroad as well as at home. . . . Compared to all the oppositions, even a \u2018strong\u2019 president is weak.\u201d\n\nSome argue the accumulation of presidential power through executive actions has been vast and dangerous. Others note this expansion is mostly in the realm of international affairs, arguing that there are really two presidencies, a strong one in foreign policy and a weak one in domestic matters. Certainly, when compared to parliamentary systems, where the head of government essentially controls both the executive and legislative branch, the American presidency is notable for its limited authority.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA national crisis has always required a heroic exertion of presidential power. It was Herbert Hoover\u2019s failure to use his office to tackle the Great Depression that led to Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s victory, and it was Roosevelt\u2019s effective and creative use of the position that rescued the economy. Ever since then, presidents have understood that, when facing a real challenge, they must use all their talents and efforts to mobilize the government\u2019s resources.\n\nThe covid-19 pandemic is just such a challenge, one of the biggest the country has ever faced. But tackling it requires that the president take charge, coordinating and overseeing the actions of dozens of federal agencies, making sure they are working in concert. It means close cooperation with the states, allowing for some variation and experimentation but still ensuring that core national standards and objectives are met. And it requires a clear, consistent message that educates and leads the public. It is hard work.\n\nA comparison with Germany is instructive. The country also has a weak central government and its chancellor has limited powers, partly because of the Nazi past and partly because of a long tradition of decentralization. As a result, when covid-19 struck, Berlin, too, faced the problem of multiple sources of authority. But the central government managed to coordinate its public health agencies successfully, steering the national response while exercising a light touch that allowed for local experimentation and the quick rollout of testing by private companies and laboratories. Chancellor Angela Merkel acted as the national guide, presenting the public with clear scientific criteria for government decisions, at one point explaining the concept of \u201cR0\u201d (the rate of spread) and why it was crucial to keep that number under one. The result is that Germany today has 110 deaths per million people compared with America\u2019s 460.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump handles the bully pulpit aspect of the White House effectively. I don\u2019t like the ideas he puts forward, but he does so in an innovative way, using all the tools of social media to amplify his voice and get out his message. Unfortunately, during the pandemic he has used his platform to promote unproven cures, discourage mask-wearing and stoke anti-lockdown sentiment. Worse still, Trump seems to think public relations is the essence of his job. As covid-19 hit, he made bold announcements about testing at every Walmart and CVS, tests with near-instant results, and massive quantities of new supplies. For the most part, he failed to deliver.\n\nThis is how Trump has handled most of his presidency, from the travel bans to repealing Obamacare. Half-baked policies are summarily announced, often on Twitter. They then get amended by federal agencies or struck down by courts or reversed by Congress. The initial chaos dies down, but little actually gets done. The point of policy for Trump is political theater, not execution. Even when he uses presidential powers \u2014 like sending federal troops to \u201crestore law and order\u201d in cities \u2014 it\u2019s to make a polemical statement, not to solve an actual problem.\n\nTrump has turned the American presidency into a reality television show.

Are teachers less essential than these professions? Apparently, they think so.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey are wrong. Evidence suggests that greater harm is being done by keeping children out of schools than by opening up. According to a report published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, \u201cChildren living in poverty, children of color, English language learners, children with diagnosed disabilities, and young children face especially severe losses.\u201d It\u2019s not just these deficits, which could reduce future income and job prospects for millions of vulnerable kids. Many depend on schools for food and health services. And working-class parents, who don\u2019t have the luxury of telecommuting, can\u2019t work if their kids are not in school.\n\nThe reason we shut down schools in the spring was because children are usually the most vulnerable group during a pandemic. But we now know that children are least vulnerable to covid-19. New York City, which was the epicenter of the pandemic, reports just 16 confirmed or suspected deaths among those 17 and younger \u2014 almost all of whom had an underlying illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cso far in this pandemic, deaths of children are less than in each of the last five flu seasons, with only 64.\u201d\n\nSchools may in fact be safer than once feared. The Wall Street Journal reports that kids are \u201cless susceptible than adults to catching the virus at all, meaning they are less likely to spread it, too.\u201d According to the New England Journal of Medicine report, schools in Finland, Belgium, Austria, Taiwan and Singapore have all reopened without increased case counts. A Nordic study found that keeping primary schools open during the pandemic had little or no effect on contagion rates, and that there was no increased risk for teachers. A French study found that keeping schools open did not give rise to secondary cases among students or teachers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is not to suggest that there is no risk in schools. Teachers who are older or have underlying medical conditions should not be required to teach. But according to my American Enterprise Institute colleagues John Bailey and Jessica Schurz, about 17 percent of all public school teachers and 22 percent of public school principals are in the vulnerable age range of 55 and older. That means that 83 percent of teachers and 78 percent of principals are not.\n\nSchools should undertake strict measures to protect students and teachers, including regular testing, daily temperature checks, masking, smaller classes, staggered schedules and outdoor classes where possible. Parents need to help protect teachers by wearing masks and practicing proper hygiene at home. And we need to accept that there may be outbreaks in some schools.

Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet came at the beginning of another tumultuous day for the country amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. As the number of virus-related deaths continued to rise, a report revealed that the economy experienced a historic contraction between April and June. Meanwhile, Trump is still trailing his Democratic rival, former vice president Joe Biden, in the polls.\n\nThe president\u2019s suggestion \u2014 which the Constitution does not empower him to do \u2014 drew unprecedented pushback from top Republicans and prominent conservatives as well as Democrats, historians and legal experts, The Washington Post reported. The rebukes continued well into the night as TV comics, frequent Trump critics, rushed to ridicule the president, likening his behavior to that of a totalitarian leader.\n\n\u201cThis is basically the move of a dictator, but Trump is just casually throwing it out there in a tweet with a bunch of question marks like he\u2019s on a group text trying to bail on happy hour,\u201d Noah quipped, before slipping into his impersonation of the president. \u201cHey ya\u2019ll, November 3\u2019s not great for me. Maybe we reschedule for 2021? Thoughts? What do you guys think, huh?\u201d\n\nBoth Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon also seized on the way Trump communicated his eyebrow-raising proposal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOh great, so not only is he casually suggesting incinerating American democracy, he\u2019s doing it like he\u2019s offering hors d\u2019oeuvres at a party,\u201d Meyers said.\n\nFallon urged Trump to \u201cstop with the question marks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last thing our country needs right now is a cliffhanger,\u201d he joked.\n\nWhile experts have stressed that Trump cannot change the date of the general election, a power that is held by Congress, the late-night hosts noted that not being allowed to do something has not stopped the president in the past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll still have the election on November 3, but he\u2019ll probably just add a hundred days to August,\u201d Noah said. \u201cAnd sure, maybe the court overturns it, but that might not happen until August 73rd.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeyers was equally skeptical.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to consult your pocket Constitution, shrug off the president\u2019s tweet and move on satisfied that we\u2019ve outmaneuvered him with a fact-check,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re just like AV club nerds explaining to the school bully why it\u2019s illegal to steal our lunch money while he repeatedly dunks our heads in the toilet.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe chances are slim of getting Trump to familiarize himself with the Constitution, Meyers added.\n\n\u201cIf you locked him in a room and told him to read the Constitution, you\u2019d come back five minutes later to find it tucked into his shirt like a bib while he wolfs down on a bunch of uncooked Goya products,\u201d the host said.\n\nTrump did not indicate Thursday whether he would seriously push for a delay, nor did he imply that he thinks he could take action without congressional approval. Later in the day, the president told reporters at a news conference that he does not want to delay the election, but said the alternative is a \u201ccrooked election,\u201d again seemingly suggesting that he is prepared to contest the results if he loses.\n\nDespite Trump escalating his rhetoric about the election in recent weeks, Thursday\u2019s tweet still caught Fallon by surprise \u2014 and left the host with more questions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAmericans are like, \u2018How long a delay are we talking about here?\u2019\u201d he asked. \u201c'Months, like your response to covid?

Then, you don\u2019t have to worry about making all these decisions anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\nStill, Noah reminded his viewers that delaying the U.S. election is \u201can absurd suggestion.\u201d", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/31/trump-election-delay-late-night/", "author": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"]}, {"title": "They came from Chicago\u2019s West Side to become the nation\u2019s first all-Black high school rowing team", "text": "\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to fall in any kind of trouble,\u201d Cooper, 38, told The Washington Post this week. \u201cTo have two guys from the West Side walking on the way to Manley talking about boats was crazy.\u201d\n\nWhat started as a group of boys, many of whom didn\u2019t know how to swim, giving the predominantly White and historically stuffy sport a chance as an after-school activity turned into something much more. Together, Cooper, Ross, Malcolm Hawkins, Ray \u201cPookie\u201d Hawkins and Preston Grandberry became not just the country\u2019s first all-Black rowing team but did so against a backdrop of poverty, racism and death.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 20th anniversary of their unlikely journey is presented in \u201cA Most Beautiful Thing,\u201d a documentary based off Cooper\u2019s self-published memoir that is available to stream on Xfinity On Demand on Friday. The film, executive produced by rapper-actor Common and NBA legends Grant Hill and Dwyane Wade, comes at a time when athletes and reopening professional sports leagues in the United States are using their worldwide platforms to address racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nThe experiment began in the Manley cafeteria with a boat and the promise of pizza in 1997. It was there that Ken Alpart, an options and futures trader, hoped to recruit Black students to form a competitive rowing team to help shatter some of the homogeneous stereotypes of predominantly White, affluent sport only shown every four years at the Olympics.\n\n\u201cNo one in the sport looked like me, so I wasn\u2019t going to do it at first,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cSports that don\u2019t require a ball, like those on the water or on the mountains, weren\u2019t for us. The conversations among us were like, \u2018White sports get you killed.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Alpart, then a 30-something White former crew team member at the University of Pennsylvania, convinced the guys, many of whom had abusive and drug-addicted parents at home, that the squad would give them skills and discipline they needed. On the West Side \u2014 where the question of \u201cWhat college are you going to go to?\u201d was replaced by \u201cWhat gang are you going to join?\u201d \u2014 they each decided rowing was worth the risk.\n\nAt first, there was tension. The teammates didn\u2019t know each other, and some were from different gangs. The crew, opting to wear basketball shorts instead of the sport\u2019s traditional trousers, flopped mightily. The people around their neighborhoods clowned the boys and said they \u201cwere rowing boats like we were in a slave ship,\u201d Cooper said, and the regatta crowd from the wealthy prep schools did not make them feel welcome either. The tough-guy front each put up at school to survive gave way to fear once they were on the water. Yet, being away from the West Side was revitalizing in a way they had not expected.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on the water and there aren\u2019t any police, sirens or gunshots, you can just focus,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThat serenity was therapeutic for us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey were quick learners and got better \u2014 and raised eyebrows in the process. A 1998 Chicago Tribune story proclaimed that the Manley crew program had \u201cshattered stereotypes about Black athletes\u201d at a school where \u201cyou\u2019re supposed to dunk basketballs, not coxswains.\u201d Grandberry, then a sophomore, told the Tribune that \u201cpeople don\u2019t expect this on the West Side of Chicago.\u201d\n\nThat feeling was echoed recently by Rep. Danny K. Davis (D-Ill.) at an online event to promote the film this month.\n\n\u201cTo see Manley break out and see what took place and what can take place, no matter the circumstances and how difficult they are \u2026 I\u2019m so delighted it came from the neighborhood where I live and work,\u201d said Davis, whose district includes the West Side.\n\nAD\n\nThe story took on an extra meaning when the team reunited for the documentary to race again 20 years later. After using the experience to become entrepreneurs and launch their careers following high school, they all had different reasons for getting back in the boat. Malcolm Hawkins returned to show his son there was another way to live than in a gang. Grandberry, who had faced jail time, wanted to reset his path. And Ross, who also faced jail time, was happy to still be alive.\n\nAD\n\nCooper wanted to go one step further: He wanted to race with members of the Chicago Police Department. The setup was initially uncomfortable \u2014 Cooper said he often had his head pressed against cop cars \u2014 but filmmaker Mary Mazzio said the exchange between the Black team and the White officers was eventually cathartic.\n\n\u201cI nearly cried behind the camera at the extraordinary kindness that Arshay and the guys showed these officers, patiently teaching them how to row, hands on hands, working together shoulder to shoulder,\u201d Mazzio said in a statement. \u201cIt was as if time and space stood still for two hours.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe film\u2019s hopefulness, and the team\u2019s heartening relationship with the officers, is particularly poignant in the wake of the police-related deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and the nationwide protests that have followed.\n\nAfter Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis in May, Cooper, who now works to help people start boating clubs in inner-city neighborhoods, texted the officers he and his teammates had connected with through rowing.

The Acting Secretary is committed to ensuring that all DHS personnel uphold the principles of professionalism, impartiality and respect for civil rights and civil liberties, particularly as it relates to the exercise of First Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nSome of the leaked DHS documents the journalists posted and wrote about revealed shortcomings in the department\u2019s understanding of the nature of the protests in Portland, as well as techniques that intelligence analysts have used. A memo by the department\u2019s top intelligence official, which was tweeted by the editor of Lawfare, says personnel relied on \u201cFINTEL,\u201d an acronym for financial intelligence, as well as finished intelligence \u201cBaseball cards\u201d of arrested protesters to try to understand their motivations and plans. Historically, military and intelligence officials have used such cards for biographical dossiers of suspected terrorists, including those targeted in lethal drone strikes.\n\nThe DHS intelligence reports, which are unclassified, are traditionally used for sharing the department\u2019s analysis with federal law enforcement agencies, state and local officials, and some foreign governments.

He and other senior administration officials have used that \u201canti-fascist\u201d label to describe people in Portland and other cities who are protesting police violence, as well as others who have vandalized statues and memorials to Confederate officers that they consider racist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe reports reflect the intelligence office\u2019s concerns about leaks of internal information.\n\n\u201cTo broadly disseminate an intelligence report, including to numerous state and local law enforcement agencies, about a DHS leak to a reporter strikes me as bizarre,\u201d said Steve Bunnell, who served as the department\u2019s general counsel for three years in the Obama administration. If department officials were concerned about unauthorized disclosures, they should refer the matter to the inspector general or handle it internally, he said.\n\nDisseminating the information about internal leaks of this nature via the intelligence reports \u201chas nothing to do with DHS\u2019s original mission,\u201d Bunnell said.\n\nAD\n\nThe Intelligence and Analysis Office has for years been the butt of jokes among larger, more established agencies like the CIA and the FBI, who liken it to a team of junior-varsity athletes. The DHS office produces reports that are largely based on unclassified, often public sources of information that current and former officials have said are of limited use.\n\nAD\n\nDuring operations in Portland, the office has sought to expand its reach. Earlier this month, DHS personnel were authorized to collect information on protesters who threaten to damage or destroy public memorials and statues, regardless of whether they are on federal property, a significant expansion of authorities that have historically been used to protect landmarks from terrorist attacks, former officials said.\n\nThe intelligence reports about the journalists say they are \u201cprovided for intelligence and lead purposes\u201d and have \u201cbeen deemed necessary for the intended recipient to understand, assess, or act on the information provided.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne of the journalists, Times reporter Mike Baker, co-wrote an article on July 28 that revealed an internal DHS memo indicating that the camouflaged federal agents sent to put down the unrest in Portland didn\u2019t understand the nature of the protests they were facing.\n\nAD\n\nThe DHS memo described the conflict as connected to a years-long history of violence against government personnel and facilities in the Pacific Northwest by \u201canarchist extremists.\u201d But it acknowledged that \u201cwe have low confidence in our assessment\u201d when it comes to understanding the current protests in Oregon\u2019s largest city.\n\n\u201cWe lack insight into the motives for the most recent attacks,\u201d the memo said.\n\nAD\n\nBaker included an image of that portion of the memo in a Twitter thread that also linked to the Times article.

The memo defended the intelligence office\u2019s authority and said its work had \u201cinformed our analysis on the enduring threat environment [in Portland] and disrupted attempted violent attacks.\u201d\n\nWittes told The Post that he didn\u2019t object to the department expressing concerns about leaks and that if officials had sent a link to his tweet in a message to employees, he wouldn\u2019t object.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the sharing of my tweet that\u2019s disturbing.

The decision, Murphy wrote, was based in part on the Open Source Intelligence Reports that officials had reviewed about protesters.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say any longer that this violent situation is opportunistic,\u201d Murphy wrote, adding that intelligence \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d led officials to believe that the attackers were driven by \u201canarchist\u201d and \u201cviolent antifa\u201d ideologies.\n\nMurphy\u2019s conclusions cut against the earlier DHS memo, which the Times reported, that said the department didn\u2019t have enough information to know whether the Portland protesters were connected to anti-government groups that had a history of operating in the region.", "link": "https://washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-compiled-intelligence-reports-on-journalists-who-published-leaked-documents/2020/07/30/5be5ec9e-d25b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html?tid=pm_pop&itid=pm_pop", "author": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter"]}, {"title": "Opinion | One president pinned it.

There will be no V-shaped recovery.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut to understand Trump\u2019s motives does nothing to lessen the outrageousness of his suggestion. The law instructs, and history underlines: We do not postpone presidential elections in this country \u2014 certainly not by presidential fiat. In any event, unless Trump is reelected, the Constitution provides that he will cease being president at noon on Jan. 20.\n\nThe solution to the challenge of conducting an election in the midst of a pandemic, and with states potentially unprepared to cope with the deluge of mail-in ballots, is to take whatever steps necessary, and provide whatever funds might be needed, to ensure that as many votes as possible are counted, quickly and securely. Fanning the flames of public doubt about the legitimacy of an election that he has not yet lost may be among the most unpresidential of Trump\u2019s many unpresidential \u2014 indeed, unpatriotic \u2014 acts.\n\nYou could, perhaps, take some solace in the fact that Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans popped his trial balloon \u2014 and with astonishing rapidity, given their ordinary cowering from any risk of incurring presidential wrath. \u201cNever in the history of the country, through wars, depressions and the Civil War, have we ever not had a federally scheduled election on time, and we\u2019ll find a way to do that again this Nov. 3,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told WNKY television in Bowling Green. \u201cNever in the history of the federal elections have we not held an election, and we should go forward,\u201d said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, to feel grateful for such morsels of resistance and sanity only underscores how little we have come to expect of Republican lawmakers. It would be too much, no doubt, to expect them to expound on the dangers of Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the legitimacy of the election. But if they believe the election should proceed, maybe they could appropriate the money needed to ensure it does so properly?\n\nApparently not. The coronavirus package just released by Senate Republicans includes no new funding \u2014 zero \u2014 for state and local officials to hold elections. \u201cWe\u2019ve already appropriated an awful lot of money for election assistance,\u201d McConnell sniffed, referring to the $400 million allocated to election help in March. House Democrats would provide an additional $3.6 billion. If the situation is as dire as their president suggests, you might think Republicans could dig a little deeper.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions would have been troubling on any day \u2014 they were especially despicable on this one, as Rep.

Lewis\u2019s funeral presented a poignant contrast between Trump and his predecessor, Barack Obama, one that served to diminish Trump even more.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nObama, eulogizing Lewis, used the pulpit as the Democratic Georgia congressman would have wanted: to argue for renewed devotion to the work he had left unfinished.\n\n\u201cWe may no longer have to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar in order to cast a ballot,\u201d Obama said, \u201cbut even as we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election that\u2019s going to be dependent on mail-in ballots so people don\u2019t get sick.\u201d\n\nAnd so Obama ticked off a national to-do list: First, revive the Voting Rights Act, gutted by the Supreme Court, and undo the \u201cflood of laws designed specifically to make voting harder,\u201d laws that represent \u201can attack on our democratic freedoms\u201d in their effort to suppress the votes of a growing minority population. Obama also called for automatic voter registration; voting rights for released felons; expanded early voting; a national holiday for Election Day; and representation for the citizens of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd if all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that\u2019s what we should do,\u201d Obama said, a first for him in public.\n\nTrump\u2019s name never crossed his lips; Trump\u2019s tweet went unmentioned. That wasn\u2019t needed. The comparison between the two presidents \u2014 one who believes in perfecting the American experiment, one who would do anything necessary to undermine it in the service of his self-interest \u2014 could not have been more stark.", "link": "https://washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-a-presidential-president-sounds-like/2020/07/30/cd18a7ec-d2a3-11ea-8c55-61e7fa5e82ab_story.html?tid=pm_pop&itid=pm_pop", "author": ["Ruth Marcus", "Deputy Editorial Page Editor Overseeing Signed Opinion Content", "Writing On Domestic Politics", "Deputy Editorial Page Editor"]}]}, "americanflavor": {"link": "https://americanflavor.news/category/public-health/", "articles": []}, "bb4sp": {"link": "https://bb4sp.com/tag/donald-trump/", "articles": []}, "beforeitsnews": {"link": "https://beforeitsnews.com", "articles": [{"title": "X22Report: The Setup Is Complete, Is This About A Virus Or The Election, Delay Playbook Known! - Must Video", "text": "X22Report: The Setup Is Complete, Is This About A Virus Or The Election, Delay Playbook Known! - Must Video\n\n% of readers think this story is Fact.

A different asteroid, 2018 SV13, is targeted by the European Space Agency, and is due to come close on September 22nd. If you read down the righthand side of the youtube page, you will see other reports of incoming asteroids. My guess is that Nibiru is pushing asteroids in front of it, as well as pulling behind it its strong magnetic tail. In a different video, Steven Ben-Nun interviews John Moore, the radio talk show host, about the government\u2019s extensive preparation for the expected disasters brought about by the arrival of the Nibiru. Including a second lock-down, that will be permanent, \u2018to ensure that people remain in place\u2019. Links below.\n\nIn English-\n\nfrom Glen\n\nto me [Steven]\n\nGood evening my friend.\n\nI have gone to great length to have my people (and consultants) help ensure my companies\u2019 emails servers are as secure as possible. That said, certain parties have technology than can intercept and decode email regardless of SSL and/or hash security and, at their discretion, the email can be manipulated or deleted at will (most being deleted). This process is \u2018costly\u2019 in that it takes valuable resources (primarily CPU/memory/hard drive space) away from tasks that may be more of a priority. I tell you this to let you know that YOU are on the radar (confirmed [Blacked out]. Our technology has made the impossible possible.\n\nConsider this heavily as there is no where anyone can hide terrestrially any longer. Even within the confines of your above ground own home, we can hear. Phones, text messages.. all communication is being monitored.\n\nI compose this email in hopes that it will \u2018slip through the cracks\u2019 since there are so many things going on. C* [a computer program of artificial intelligence] once had compelling reasons (up until the Bill Clinton administration) but is now equivalent to the full-blown dark side, no longer caring about Americans. Americans are just part of the herd and potentially the enemy now.\n\n[note. Steven interjecting: \"Now I throw that in there because the whole point is what we are facing, Is that they don't really care about the American people when all these asteroids are coming our way now. And so speaking about these asteroids, one thing I just want to remind you about is: Glen saying these things to me, I have another source as well with uh.. does a lot of work with the Pentagon, very close to the generals, etc. And it was also all the information I've shared that Glen told me about, they have also confirmed that. Yes indeed, and I've shared this with you already, that uh the September - Now this is theirs, this is what they're telling me. I can't say this for sure, but they were telling me that come September there would not be anybody on the planet that doesn't know that we are in serious trouble. Now that's what Glen said to me directly in a private secured phone conversation we had.. That September no one-- everybody on the planet would know that we are in serious trouble. Now that was confirmed by another friend with direct sources with generals in the Pentagon, and that went even further as to say that the people would be able to see with their own naked eye this system coming in. \"].. turn on \u2018subtitles\u2019 to read what he says.\n\n\u2026\u2026 rate about 70%, but things are much worse in reality teetering on many different opportunities for catastrophe. Anything you can imagine (mostly evil) is now not only [possible but] perfected and enhanced. Control of each individual is the name of the game and for those that are \u2018non-compliant\u2019 (they love that word) sadness and death await.\n\n\u2026\u2026 than ever, that we each decide on, and pledge allegiance to, our core beliefs and relationship to God as a father regardless of how stupid, childish, or foolish it may \u2026\u2026 this is the ONLY way to combat a force [satan] who was once second to God. Each of us will soon start to walk in the shoes of Job.\n\n\u201cThe subject has grown to be extremely complex.\n\nOver three decades ago the forecast of catastrophic environment challenges and timelines were disclosed to me. Luckily, the timeline was somewhat inaccurate as certain dates have passed and nothing happened\n\n[3 lines blacked out]\n\nExtra-terrestrially, events seem to be close to being on-schedule with exception to elevated radiation. Our solar system is just starting to go through a, what you may call, asteroid belt of sorts. Crossing this belt is like trying to run cross a 5 line highway full of differing types of traffic at random speeds. The chances you will get hit are very, very high. The chances you get hit by a bicycle (little damage) exists, but not as likely as getting hit by something larger or faster moving. Divinely, Jupiter generally blocks the big stuff from hitting us. Thus, we have a general idea of probabilities for about 80% of the rocks, but 20% are either too small or too fast or just simply missed. However, the elevated radiation hitting our earth was not understood or known or considered and this radiation is causing the earth to heat up internally, and much like an egg, and cracks are starting to form. These cracks were not anticipated and the implications are under great debate. Example: In certain cases, fresh water is draining into these cracks displacing weight and other dynamics used in complex calculations that determine many things about terrestrial life and potential challenges.\n\n[part of a line blacked out], as I am a nuclear scientist. But I do know of many projects that use cultivated and/or so called \u2018weaponised\u2019 viruses. This is [1 line blacked out] .. alone the risks associated with releasing the virus\u2019 in our atmosphere. They are generally more concerned about a natural disaster event damaging the containment than terrorist event.\n\nUp until 2010\u2032ish, underground bunkers were the focus of safety and $Billions were spent on them. Now there is doubt being expressed because of the heating of the earth internally, and these bunkers becoming too hot to live in and, to add insult to injury, flooding. It would be one thing if the flooding was temporary, but there are significant oceanic displacement concerns.\n\nKnowing of the complexities and given how complex your question really is, I am very sorry to say that the best I can do is give you my opinion based on probabilities. Keep in mind that no place is completely safe or without risks/events.\n\nIsrael (ironically & strangely) is the safest place to move but will suffer from earthquakes and wind problems, followed by central Africa, followed by central China. In the USA, things don\u2019t look good.. Earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, very strong winds > 100mph, etc. Missouri is the \u2018official\u2019 FEMA safe haven for USA (in the impervious plate zones) followed by Nebraska. However Nebraska is expected to have much \u2026 wind/tornadoes damage due to its flat elevation.\n\nlinks-\n\nSteven Ben is certain about Asteroid Impact with the Earth in September ?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utTLsDQHSeE\n\nNew Source Confirms In Coming Asteroids, July 19th 2020\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zk3ADdL31g\n\nThird video \u2013 interview with John Moore, July 28th 2020\n\nMilitary Insider Shares His Knowledge Of Coming Disaster\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oIOJd2r77I\n\nNibiru \u2013 Seen from Space, seen from the Earth, July 27th\n\n/spirit/2020/07/nibiru-dr-sam-nibiru-planet-x-seen-from-space-and-also-from-the-earth-2517829.html\n\nJesus \u2013 \u201ca solemn September assembly\u201d, July 27th 2020\n\n/spirit/2020/07/jesus-a-distinct-division-of-souls-is-coming-very-soon-given-july-26th-2020-2517813.html\n\n\u201cPrayer must become your focus.

All were killed by nerve gas, and the task was done by agents of Mossad. The same fate met the passengers that were on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, who were actually flown to the island of Diego Garcia and killed. The reason this Malaysia Airlines flight was chosen was it was carrying four passengers involved in a new technology who refused to sell their shares of their company and the Illuminati also needed passengers of different races and nationalities for their future plans. So they killed two birds with one stone, so to speak. By these four individuals being killed. the technology patent reverted to Rothschild.\n\nMH 17 was also a suspicious crash as a passenger took a picture of the plane before boarding and the plane that crashed in Ukraine was clearly not the same aircraft.\n\nWhat are their future plans for these passengers and who is behind all of these sinister events?\n\nAll of these passengers on these six planes have been cloned, their souls removed (yes we have the technology to do this) and all passengers will soon be delivered back to humanity here on earth in a grand entrance by aliens in a spacecraft, very much like the movie \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind.\u201d Why would the Satanic elite do this?\n\nFirst of all, we are not dealing with alien beings from outer space here. We are dealing with demonic fallen angels who the Bible refers to as Nephilim and Rephaim. All governments have been working with these fallen angels or watchers since World War Two. Earth itself is a prison colony for these beings. Unfortunately for humanity, they have crept into every segment of society in every country (see Jude 1:4). These evil fallen angels are behind the disappearances of our children as they need human blood to survive. That is why there have been so many movies coming out of Hollywood featuring vampires.\n\nSecondly, the Illuminati, if that is what you wish to call them or the Deep State (I can think of other choice terms for them), always follow Satan who always tries to imitate God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob.\n\nSatan will have these aliens arrive on earth in a grand deception bringing all of these cloned aircraft passengers telling us they are from heaven. This is Satan\u2019s attempt at resurrecting the dead to copy the resurrection of the dead in Christ being resurrect in the Harpazo by God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob.\n\nSatan also likes to invert all of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s commandments and this is one of the reasons why the healthy are being forced to quarantine and wear masks. Leviticus tells us that only the sick should be quarantined and wear masks.\n\nGod of Abraham Isaac and Jacob told us Jesus will be returning to earth to destroy all evil in 1 Corr. 15:24-25. Satan and his followers always tell us what they plan to do prior to doing it but it is usually in the form of a riddle or movie or commercial or the cover of the Economist Rothschild owned magazine. Satan\u2019s plans are usually broadcast on television and cinema, and I don\u2019t have to tell you what group controls the media. After all, Satan is the power of the air (waves) and both the Jews and Moslems worship Satan / Lucifer. The Freemason\u2019s god is Lucifer as well. All the secret societies are controlled by the Jews.\n\nThere are several events that must occur before the spacecraft event / Project Bluebeam. I will give them to you in no particular order. Donald Trump and Michael Pence will be taken out of the way as per Revelation 11:7. I believe the two of them will be assassinated together in Washington. There is absolutely no possibility of a Democrat being elected President, so there has to be a coup with Nancy Pelosi or General Millie becoming President. There will be preplanned civil unrest, martial law declared, the Constitution suspended, and the forced disarming of the civilian population under threat of death in order to implement the Jewish Communist/Fascist New World Order.\n\nThere will also be a planned disaster that will impact Hawaii and San Francisco or Los Angeles and then New York City. These will all involve a Tsunami caused by a underwater nuclear detonation.\n\nOrthodox Jews who follow the Satanic Kabbalah use a form of Hebrew Gematria to interpret verses in the Torah. They turn the biblical words into numbers based on the Hebrew Alphabet. The trouble is they turn the numbers upside down like a 9 to a 6. King David used Holy Gematria in 1 Samuel 30: 7-8 making use of an Ephod (there are three types of Ephod mentioned in the Bible, including the type David used which we would call an Abacus or calculator or Ipad). Notice that David inquired of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob which means he asked a question through words in the Hebrew Alphabet converted to numbers. David got the answer to his question in numbers which he then converted to words. Unfortunately, Holy Gematria was lost to us over time. Jesus and the Essenes as well as the prophets used Holy Gematria to seal prophecy in our bible which can only be deciphered at the End of the Age which we are certainly living In now.\n\nAfter I retired, I happened to read a book on Sir Isaac Newton. Not many people know that Newton spent years trying to decipher the book of Revelation through mathematics. He was one of the few that realized that God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob communicates and creates through numbers while His son the Logos or Jesus communicates through words.\n\nTo make a very long story short, and after years of effort, I now know the type of Holy Gematria that was used throughout the New Testament and the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were written by the Essenes. I have also managed to decipher the entire prophecy in Revelation, and know how to ask God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob a question similar to King David.\n\nNow to finish up, look at Revelation 11:9-12. Once Trump and Pence will be taken out of the way, they will be resurrected after three and a half days at the same time as the Rapture. Now look at 2 Thessalonians 2:6-7.\n\nThe Restrainer is referred to both in the neuter (what) and masculine (he) gender. This can only refer to the Holy Spirit, which I believe will be removed from earth, ending the Age of Grace. I believe the Holy Spirit will stay for an additional five months after the Rapture to assist those left behind.\n\nHowever the Rapture is not what most people believe as only the saved dead; 144,000 saints currently living on earth; Israelite toddlers and babies and the disabled will be Raptured along with Trump and Pence. There is no rapture of the Church as many pastors have preached. The Church of Philadelphia was promised to be saved from the hour of testing which is the hour of nuclear war or Armageddon.\n\nThe beast from the abyss in Rev. 11:7 is Barack Hussein Obama who will be instrumental in the planning of the assassination of Trump and Pence.\n\nThe cloned passengers from the aircraft who were killed will be returning on a spacecraft along with Trump and Pence. Trump\u2019s head wound will hav been healed as will JFK\u2019s head wound as per Revelation 13:3 when they return. JFK will be a clone. Trump and Pence are bene ha\u2019elohim or sons of gods and are immortal so they could be the real thing or clones. Other cloned prominent people will also return with the aLIEn arrival such as Lady Diana, JFK Jr, John and Robert Kennedy, Elvis Presley, Robin Williams, Michael Jackson and many others, and it is all brought to you by the Rothschilds, the Jesuits, the Freemasons and the United Nations led by the antiChrist Antonio Guterres and sponsored by George Soros.\n\nThe clones will not have aged and will be the same age and appearance as at the time of their death. These clones are possessed by demons so do not embrace them or jump into bed with them or you may get an awful surprise. You can usually smell a demon by their aroma. The demons wear ode de sulfer and stink just like the Jew New World Odor!\n\nMany Q Anons believe JFK Jr. is already here and have fallen for this deception. If JFK Jr. returns, he is a clone and being controlled by demons to deceive the massess. Do not believe in this disinformation!\n\nThis fake alien event concerning a spacecraft is the reason U.F.O.\u2019s have been in the forefront of the news recently as they are getting ready to implement Project Bluebeam. Trump is the False Jewish Snake Messiah and is the rider on the white horse in Revelation and one of the two imposter prophets of Revelation 11:7-11 who will be killed. Pence is the other imposter prophet. Trump has to return in order for the world to consider him a Savior and Messiah Ben Joseph of the Ashkenazi Jews. There is not Savior here on earth other than Jesus Our Messiah and King of Kings and HIgh Priest.\n\nOne last word. If you can flee from America, do so as quickly as possible. Canada is not safe. When martial law is declared, all air travel will be banned. Egypt would be a good bet. America was given four hundred years from its founding in 1620, when the Puritans established the Plymouth colony, to develop into the nation of priests we were supposed to become and we have failed badly. America was founded on Christian value and the law of the land was the Holy Bible just as God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob gave it to the Tribes of Jacob surnamed Israel at Mount Sinai.\n\nWhen the Puritans journeyed to North America and established the Massachusetts Bay Colony, they brought their sense of obligation to God and God\u2019s law with them. The Puritans believed that by fulfilling their obligations to the Creator, as described in the Holy Bible, God would bless them. Failure to fulfill those obligations would anger God and result in punishment.\n\nThe sad facts of our failures in God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s eyes are brought home to us by Matthew 12:41.\n\n\u201cThe men of Nineveh shall stand up with this generation at the judgment, and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. (Matthew 12:41)\n\nAt Jonah\u2019s preaching, all of the citizens of Nineveh repented, and they were all granted a stay of execution by God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob for a hundred years until they returned to their evil ways. America is too far gone to fully repent today and change their wicked ways. There are more witches in America than Presbyterians and the evil numbers are growing. On a scale, the world is more evil than righteous and I estimate it is 85% evil and only 15% righteous. Once the Luciferians kill the Christians and the Caucasians, then the scale of evil will increase.\n\nhttps://www.christianpost.com/news/witches-outnumber-presbyterians-in-the-us-wicca-paganism-growing-astronomically.html\n\nJesus Our Messiah is here today and much great than Jonah. Jesus Our Savior is Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and Omniscient.\n\nAnd I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. (Revelation 19:6 KJV)\n\nThe citizens of Nineveh at the great white throne Judgment will condemn our generation for not being biblically aware and for not following God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s laws. Most of the Churches today do not even teach the Old Testament and said that it is no longer applicable and falsely teach that the New Covenant replaced it. Jesus only did away with the Ceremenial Laws when the veil was torn after his crucifixtion as Jesus Our Messiah was the perfect sacrifice. Jesus followed the Old Tesament Law and Matthew 5:18 tells us that the Old Testament Law is still in effect until heaven and earth pass away.\n\nFor I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. (Matthew 5:18)\n\nThere is great destruction and suffering coming to America, as well as Britain and the other British Commonwealth nations that make up Ephraim (Britain) and Manasseh (USA). Manasseh means forgetfulness and American certainly has forgotten God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and their heritage. America is to receive a double portion of destruction (Rev. 18:6) as America is Babylon the great.\n\nIn Revelation 9:3 both locusts and scorpions are mentioned in regards to Germany in World War Two and America during the timeframe we are in now. In the Holy Gematria that I use, locusts refer to Nazis and scorpions refer to the Waffen S.S. Hitler and the S.S. were heavily involved in the occult and managed to open the abyss and let some of these demonic beings out. Demons are disembodied spirits that look for a dead body to inhabit. All the S.S. were demonic. The abyss is located in Antarctica which explains why the Nazis were there.\n\nThere was an attempted Nazi Coup in 1933 that was orchestrated by Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Du Pont and a group of American Bankers to overthrow President Roosevelt. It was foiled by the efforts of General Smedley Butler. I believe there will soon be a successful Nazi Coup in America, most likely before the end of this year. Trump\u2019s Address to the United Nations in which he came out firmly against nations giving up their sovereignty was his death warrant. See Jeremiah 51:13-14 as it refers to locusts (Nazis ) in America (Babylon).\n\nIt was only representatives of the German Army and Navy that signed the surrender papers with the Allies after World War Two. No representatives of the German Government were on hand to sign the surrender papers on behalf of the German Government, so technically we are still at war with the Nazis and they are winning! One hundred and fifty thousand high ranking Nazis simply disappeared after the war. Project Paper Clip reported about 1600 Nazis came to America but I think it was more like 60,000.\n\nThe Vatican\u2019s Rat Lines and later the CIA were responsible for these Nazis entering America and many, including Mengele and Hitler ended up in Argentina. It is interesting to note that all of David Rockefeller\u2019s property is up for sale in the States. Another rat that left a sinking ship as he is alive and well in Israel awaiting the planned destruction of America. Rockefeller was a major financial backer of Cern in Switzerland by which the Illuminati will try to kill Jesus on his return by creating a black hole in space which supposedly would suck Jesus into it. God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob laughs at them in derision (Psalm 2:4).\n\nDo I know the full story of 9/11? Mostly. Do I think anyone will be brought to trial? Yes but not in America. They will all be tried, found guilty and punished by the God of us all at the Great White Throne Judgment! Do I know why 911 took place? Yes. It was orchestrated to cover a gold theft; to destroy all evidence in regard to two hundred trillion missing from the Pentagon; to destroy all documents relating to the bailout of American banks by the American taxpayer due to the banks selling fraudulent C.D.O.\u2019s and to give the CIA the green light to invade Afghanistan and take over the poppy fields that they coveted. When America first invaded Afghanistan, there were 40,000 acres of poppy under cultivation. Today, under the efforts of the CIA, there are 480,000 acres under cultivation. The CIA and FBI have to keep the dumbed down Americans supplied and happy so they don\u2019t wake up and rebel against the government.\n\nIncidentally did you know that the 9/11 events are mentioned in Revelation and Jeremiah? Seem my article for the full details.\n\nExplanation of All the Witnesses in Revelation 11 and Confirmation That the Rapture Will Occur in July or August 2020\n\n/prophecy/2020/07/explanation-of-all-the-witnesses-in-revelation-11-and-confirmation-that-the-rapture-will-occur-in-july-or-august-2020-2512643.html\n\nAfter 9/11 took place, the churches across America were packed. But no church could explain the events. Zechariah 11:6-17 explains everything. God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob has broken his covenant, which includes His protection for His chosen people, represented by the two broken staffs, Favor and Union.\n\nIn Holy Gematria, Union represents Great Britain and the Commonwealth and Favor represents America. The Jews were never God\u2019s chosen people. They are not Israelites, they are Khazars and are not Shemites. It has always been humorous to me that if you speak against the Jews, they will accuse you of antisemitism when they are not Shemites themselves. Today\u2019s \u201cJews\u201d are the arch enemy of all things good and all things living. They are \u201cof their father the devil\u201d (John 8:44). The Jewish Encyclopedia, 1925 edition, Vol. 5, page 41, states, \u201cEdom is in modern Jewry.\u201d\n\nEsau sold his birthright to his brother Jacob (Israel) for some \u201cRed pottage\u2026 therefore was his name called Edom\u201d (Gen. 25:30). Edom means \u2018red\u2019. It is impossible for Edomite Jews to call themselves Israelites. Jacob remained racially pure, while his brother Esau took alien wives.\n\nRevelation 11:9 and 11:13 are dual prophecies that will occur twice. The first occurrence was 9/11. Television coverage of 9/11 consisted of continuous coverage over three and a half days, the longest coverage in history of any one event. When the Twin Towers came down, ten percent of the total amount of office space that had been available in Manhattan was lost. I have been told that a jet carrying explosives is being prepared to hit the White House, so we may be in for three and a half days of television coverage once again. I won\u2019t be watching this time as I hate reruns.\n\nWhat event caused God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob to cancel His covenant with His people? What sin was so great? What sin was the unforgivable sin? Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit as per Matthew 12:31-32 and that is what the banking elite in America, who are all members of the Illuminati and Luciferians, purposely did. They not only did it, but they did if by using the name of the Holy Spirit to commit fraud. All of this concerns the selling of CDO\u2019s by the banks that happened prior to the 9/11 event. (Better for you if I don\u2019t tell you the name of the Holy Spirit)\n\nThe current head of the Sanhedrin is Baruch Kahane. Kahane is advocating the adoption by all countries of the contrived seven Noahide laws which will be a license to decapitate Christians due to the fact that one of the Noahide laws outlaws Idolatry. The worship of Jesus will be considered idolatry by the Sanhedrin. The Freemasonic Lodges, Synagogues and Catholic Churches will be used to remove the heads of Christians by guillotine. The Catholic Churches worship Lucifer and even have a telescope named L.U.C.I.F.E.R. The Jews are the seedline of Satan and are at war with the Holy Seed of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob which is the Caucasian Christian Nations of Western Europe, the British Commonwealth Nations and America and they plan to eliminate the white race and kill all Christians.\n\nJesus will return to earth in early 2022 with His myriad of Holy Angels for the Gog and Magog war and then lead His remnant people gathered in Egypt for the Greater Exodus to the promised land as promised in Genesis 48:21.\n\nJesus Our Messiah and King of Kings and High Priest will be returning to bring this age to a close in 2022. Revelation is the last book of the Bible and has twenty two chapters, just as there are twenty two letters in the Hebrew Alphabet.\n\nMost people do not realize that the last week of Daniel began in May 2016.\n\nThe Beginning of Daniel\u2019s Last Week also called the Tribulation\n\nThe Desire for Signs\n\n38Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, \u201cTeacher, we want to see a sign from You.\u201d 39But He answered and said to them, \u201cAn evil and adulterous generation craves for a sign; and yet no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet; 40for just as JONAH WAS THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS IN THE BELLY OF THE SEA MONSTER, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. (Matt. 12:38-40)\n\nThe birth pangs spoken of in Matt. 24 began on May 27, 2016 when 3 ships in 3 days sank carrying migrants across the Mediterranean, drowning over 700 people. It was an ABOMINATION that these people were not rescued and returned to their country of origin.\n\nSee my previous article for more details.\n\nExplanation of All the Witnesses in Revelation 11 and Confirmation That the Rapture Will Occur in July or August 2020\n\n/prophecy/2020/07/explanation-of-all-the-witnesses-in-revelation-11-and-confirmation-that-the-rapture-will-occur-in-july-or-august-2020-2512643.html\n\nSee all of Dr. Luke Prophet\u2019s articles on the Book of Revelation for the complete Rubber Necker\u2019s guide to Armageddon.

Animal-human hybrids were reported to have crawled out of it, and dark-winged, otherworldly creatures flew in its vicinity. Legend has it that when construction began in the castle, all of the inmates that were sentenced to death were offered a pardon if they consented to be lowered by rope into the hole, and report back on what they saw. When the first person was lowered, he began screaming after a few seconds, and when pulled back to the surface he looked as if he had aged 30 years. He had grown wrinkled and his hair had turned white.\n\nAccording to the Prague Tourism web site, the castle is reputed to have various types of ghosts, \u201ca bullfrog/human creature, a headless horse, and an old woman\u201d as well as the remains of \u201cdemonic beasts who escaped the pit\u201d.\n\nHouska Castle was built with no fortifications, no source of water, no kitchen, near no trade routes, no external defenses, and with no occupants at its time of completion. It is in forests, swamps, and mountains. The castle was not built as a residence or as a protective sanctuary but was instead built because the hole was thought to be a gateway to hell. Thus, by constructing the Gothic building, they were able to keep the demons trapped in the lower level thickest walls closest to the hole of the castle.\n\nThe Travel Channel series \u201cLegendary Locations\u201d covered several sites in Season 2, Episode 4, including the castle \u201csaid to protect a portal to hell\u201d.\n\nHouska Castle was featured on an episode of Ghost Hunters International which aired on SyFy on July 22, 2009. Most Haunted Live visited the castle on March 26, 2010. The French team of paranormal investigators, R.I.P Recherches investigations paranormal, investigated the Castle in 2013 in their episode \u201cThe Hell Gate\u201d (Episode 2, Season 3).\n\nVideo 2\n\nHigh strangeness, deep underground military bases, and the end times.\n\nYou need to see this one!\n\nI sat down with Darrin Geisinger, Author of Zero-G\u2019s for this very special interview, find more about Darrin and his work at this link, https://darringeisinger.com/ Stay tuned for part 2 of this interview where we talk about his book!\n\nThe Native Americans Have been using Humic & Fulvic Minerals for Centuries!

We can speculate on how this has happened, and why it has continued, but the purpose of the inaugural White Coat Summit is to empower Americans to stop living in fear. If Americans continue to let so-called experts and media personalities make their decisions, the great American experiment of a Constitutional Republic with Representative Democracy, will cease.\n\nDr. Stella Immanuel from Houston, Texas. Dr. Stella Immanuel from Houston, Texas.\n\nOne of the speakers at the press conference today was Dr. Stella Immanuel from Houston, Texas. She stated that she studied medicine in Nigeria where she used Hydroxychloroquine for malaria patients, and is therefore very experienced with this medication, and that she has now treated over 350 COVID patients in Texas with Hydroxychloroquine, and none of them have died.\n\nI\u2019m here because I have personally treated over 350 patients with COVID. Patients that have diabetes, patients that have high blood pressure, patients that have asthma, all people. My oldest patient is 92. The result has been the same. I put them on Hydroxychloroquine, I put them on zinc, I put them on Zithromax, and they are all well. For the past few months I have taken care of over 350 patients with not one lost one. Not a diabetic, not somebody with high blood pressure, not somebody with asthma, not an old person. We\u2019ve not lost one patient! And, on top of that, I\u2019ve put myself, my staff, and many doctors that I know, on Hydroxychloroquine, for prevention. None of us have gotten sick. I came here to Washington D.C. to tell America, nobody needs to die! I\u2019m upset! Why am I upset? Because I see people who cannot breathe. I see parents walk in, I see diabetics sitting in my office, knowing (thinking) that this is a death sentence! And they can\u2019t breathe! And I help them, and I tell them it\u2019s going to be OK. You\u2019re going to live. And we treat them, and they live. None have died!\n\nWhen are you going to wake up, America, and realize that you are fearing the wrong thing! You do not need to fear COVID, you need to fear our political medical leaders who are complicit with MURDER!!\n\nAnd Hydroxychloroquine is not the only successful treatment. There are non-drug treatments as well that have seen success and been censored, such as IV Vitamin C therapy and Ozone therapy.

Unbeknownst to the American people and those enslaved across all Crown Colonies (including the people in the British Isles) the people have been ruled by a ruthless criminal cabal operating an illegitimate De facto Crown Corp. Military Government System since the American civil War. The Luciferian Controllers that set up this system have been running America from the shadows for the last 150 years. It appears Trump and awake Americans have gotten in the way of phase I of the Cults Genocide plan yet it appears at this time that the Phase II 5G 2nd wave has not yet been de-railed. It is time for the awakened American people to break up the party now we have data on the gathering 5G threat. It is time we arrest the seditionists and traitors masquerading as Lawful Government based on blatant violations of the organic foundations of our original Government that banned all foreign agents from American Governance!

The fifty states Governments were usurped by the same foreign powers decisevely from approx 1934 \u2013 1954 when foreign De Facto Corporate Governances were installed over the states to enable more efficient asset stripping and looting of America and the theft of your labor and IP. The truth is America has been ruled under Military War Powers by a Military Government since the Civil War thanks to traitor Lincoln. See Page 19 of the FM27 below. The BAR according to this manual from 1947 is overseen by the Army. More of this is covered at the Home Page of 1776Reloaded.org. Land of the Free and the brave is an illusion to keep us servile! This explains why the US Flag has been captured in a yellow fringe! Go to Page 20 for the BAR reference in this manual.\n\nAn agent of the Luciferian Roman Zionist Cabal boasted of the plan to enslave Americans before implementing the plan which slavery system was installed under the Emergency Banking Relief Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act on March 9th 1933. Edward Mandell House had this to say in a private meeting with President Woodrow Wilson about the Talmudic Usury Debt Slavey Plan:\n\n\u201c[Very] soon, every American will be required to register their biological property in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging. By such methodology, we can compel people to submit to our agenda, which will effect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency. Every American will be forced to register or suffer being unable to work and earn a living. They will be our chattel, and we will hold the security interest over them forever, by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions. Americans, by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent, forever to remain economic slaves through taxation, secured by their pledges. They will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser, for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and, if by accident one or two should figure it out, we have in our arsenal plausible deniability. After all, this is the only logical way to fund government, by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges. This will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every American a contributor to this fraud which we will call \u201cSocial Insurance.\u201d Without realizing it, every American will insure us for any loss we may incur and in this manner, every American will unknowingly be our servant, however begrudgingly. The people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption and, we will employ the high office of the President of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against America.\u201d\n\nNote the Bankruptcy of the Vatican \u2013 Crown US Inc.was part of a deliberate plan to enslave the American people under Talmudic Usury Debt Slavery System: - https://1776reloaded.org/joomla30/index.php/unlearn/503-the-united-states-is-bankrupt-by-john-nelson-re-senate-report-no-93-549-etc NOTE.

Their are 1.3M active BAR attorneys in America which are a foreign 5th column at War with the Ameircan people. The Attorneys lie to us all and used their knowledge of this fraud to defraud us all!\n\nIn the following 2 minute video an Attorney states that Attorneys run the country \u2013 yet \u2013 TONA tells us that they are XConstitutionally banned foreign agents! Who is committing sedition and treason? Can Lawbreakers lawfully run America ? NO!\n\nSo what happens when a physical State is ran by a foreign Corporation which itself is ran by Constitutionally Banned foreign agents that are by virtue of status in a mixed war with the people on the physical state. They engage in unbidled criminality. Those running the states operate above the Law [InJustUS] and run the state Machinery, the Legal system as the Mafia would do so! These parasites have total control over the Fraudulent so called Court System which they use to control people in the state. California is a great Case study:\n\nThis should explain why California and most of the states are totally corrupt! Its because all is being ran by a Criminal Cabal engaged in RICO that run the legal System as a Mafia \u2013 RICO Operation which they use to grant favors to Corporate Cronnies (pay to play) and to steal property from we the people. They use this power to direct policy to support those that put them in power which is corrupt Governors! Running State Machinery is a great way to quieten those that the \u201cSystem\u201d wants silenced or controlled.\n\nThese Constituitionally Banned foreign agents are engaged in a Mixed War on the Californian people which until now has been tolerated by the Crown \u2013 Vatican US Corp. even though those waging war on the people on the states are breaking their own laws, rules and codes with impunity!\n\nAll Courts in America are Foreign Private for profit Corporations and NOT judicial courts! They are not operating in accordance with English \u2013 Common Law! Every case before the courts is a Case of Lawfare and Simulated Legal Process which is evident on the face of the record (Fake Summons, Fake Writ, Fake Warrants ALL UNDER FAKE SEAL)!\n\nDo you now understand why America is $%^&*ed up and why the Criminals operating the state wide RICO are at war with the people and the foundations on which America and the states were built: http://www.internallydisplacedpeople.org/joomla30/index.php/courtseals When you see an Alphabet agency \u2013 place the words Rothschilds in front of it! You will then better understand its function and what is going on!\n\nThe World is a stage and the American people have been and are being played by parasites!\n\nAre we going to be the innocent victims of the latest Luciferian Roman Zionist Cult Genocide PsyOp? We the American people allowed more than a million people to killed in the 911 PsyOp and tens of millions of lives to be ruined because we did not stand up against the NWO menace in 2001 onward. Will will learn the lesson this time around or are we going to allow ourselves to used by useful idiots?\n\nTHERE IS NO QUESTION WE ARE BEING PLAYED BY A SHADOW GOVERNMENT MADE UP OF MAD MEN THAT WANT US TOTALLY CONTROLLED AND / OR DEAD!\n\n911 Pre-planned by the Jesuits \u2013 Zionist NWO \u2026. to enable the Patriot Act, destruction of the Middle East for the Greater Israel Project\u2026\n\nGOV ID 1984 \u2013 planned by the Jesuits \u2013 Zionist NWO \u2026. t force the TECHNO \u2013 FASCIST AGENDA / NWO DOWN OUR THROATS\u2026.

THESE LAWS WERE NOT WRITTEN TO CONTROL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY LAWFULLY SUBJECT TO THE ENGLISH AMERICAN COMMON LAW, NOT TO FOREIGN CORPORATE RULES CODES OR STATUTES MASQUERADING AS LAW:\n\nThe chief purpose of the four Organic Laws is to regulate and control government, not you. These are the founding documents of the United States of America, which means no statute or code should conflict with principles set forth in these documents. Merriam-Webster defines \u201corganic\u201d as \u201cof, relating to, or constituting the law by which a government or organization exists\u201d. In the front of Volume One of the United States Code, you will find the heading Organic Laws of the United States of America. The four Organic Laws listed, in the order of their occurrence, are:\n\nThe Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776 The Articles of Confederation of November 15, 1777 Northwest Ordinance of July 13, 1787 Constitution of September 17, 1787\n\nTHE ORIGINAL LAWFUL ORGANIC CONSTITUTION HAD ONLY 13 LAWFULLY ENACTED ARTICLES, THE LAST OF WHICH, XIII BANNED ALL FOREIGN AGENTS FROM GOVERNMENT!\n\nSee proofs below: Please note that the 1865 version lists the last Act as XIII, then in 1867 we see a De facto Amendment XIV appear (created outside of a lawful Quorum, lawfully seated sovereign states compact created Government) which in the later counterfeit De Facto Constitution becomes the now 13th Amendment! This evidences the BAR Fu%$ery of our Organic original foundational laws! Q. Where did the original organic XIII dispear too that had been published in state certified documents for the previous 50+ years? The seditionists and traitors in our tent vanished it because it banned foreign agents from our Government forever! They vanished it by inventing a new Corporate charter for their newly formed DC municipal Corp. Gov. See here for more on this sedition, treason and fraud: http://usavsus.info/ The best research on this CROWN BAR fu%$ery of our Organic Governances\u2019 is at AnnaVonReitz.com\n\nProof http://www.mediafire.com/file/xyc24bmcgjpyhfr/Titles_of_Nobility_XIII_from_Colorado_Archive_1865_1867.pdf/file\n\n(more proofs below \u2013 look for Mediafire links in this document)\n\nRemember \u2013 Law Breakers can not make law, change our organic laws or judge others on the actual laws of the land! I hope this is helping you see through the 200 + years of lies told the American people and why its time we take back our country from foreign agents of the Luciferian cabal merely masquerading as our organic We the people founding fathers Governments\u2026. ! Trump needs to be more vocal about exposing these 200 year ongoing crimes if the silent awake majority across America are to fully trust him! He also needs to tell the Rothschilds UN-WHO-CDC Vaccine Corp, NIH Corp. to get out of America and try principals for crimes against humanity\u2026.\n\nIn a hearing in DC today, Nadler said to Attorney General BAR\u2026 \u201cYou really can\u2019t hide behind legal fictions this time, Mr. Barr.\u201d I am sure this meant something very different to me then it did most Americans! How many know what a legal fiction is and why understanding it is important? The entire Slavery Artifice operated over the American people is a by product of a legal fiction (Office of the Person) created by the De Facto UNITED STATES Corp. without knowledge or consent of the American people. It is an artifice of the American Slavery system post 1933 just as a steel loop around a neck was a feature of early slavery systems! This USRael Slavery system is NOT based on the founding organic laws of our Nation! Its a product of Talmudic Luciferian Cult Parasites that infiltrated Governance in America and not of any lawful acts of men upholding the law of the land! The De Facto legal system relies on the total fraud of the creation of the US Corporate Personna in its myriad of forms! The US Corp. and the STATE OF STATE Corp. as fictions can only deal with Corporate PERSONS not men and women!\n\nThis massive scam is at the root of the entire legal system frauds operating across the Western World today which is a product of the CROWN BAR Private guild which through TONA banned CROWN Franchised foreign agents from infiltrating American Governance! This is why they buried TONA. More on this at 1776Reloaded.org! In brief those running the legal system and de facto Governance system need the American people to agree to operate as if they are PERSONS and not men and women with unalienable rights. The MEET YOUR STRAWMAN Video is linked here and can be found at the bottom of this page. If you are new to these concepts it will help you to start to see the nature of the United States Human Trafficking Scam. Note that the DOJ is a product of the De Facto US Corp. and NOT the Organic Lawful The United States of America! The DOJ Department (a Dept of US Corp.) was created to perpetuate Emergency War Powers over the American people in the form of a perpetual Mixed War, aka lay the foundation for the Human Trafficking System to come and for the CROWN BAR Guild to infiltrate America as they did do! Yet \u2013 Fraud vitiates all acts of Fraud!\n\nOUR ORGANIC NATIONAL SOVEREIGN STATES CREATED GOVERNANCE WAS INFILTRATED AFTER THIS ARTICLE BECAME LAW AND CONSTITUTIONALLY BANNED FOREIGN AGENTS HAVE SINCE INCREASINGLY BEEN RUNNING OUR NATION/S SINCE AND MAKING UP RULES AND CODES MASQUERADING AS LAW! BANNED FOREIGN AGENTS HAVE NO LAWFUL AUTHORITY TO MAKE LAW OR CHANGE OUR IMMUTABLE ORGANIC LAW OR TO IGNORE THE ENGLISH COMMON LAW! THE INFILTRATORS SET UP A COUNTERFEIT GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS IN DC IN THE LATE 1860\u2032s AND BETWEEN 1934 \u2013 1954 ACROSS THE STATES (in the order of 200,000 Territorial / Municipals Governances\u2019 violating the Guarantee of a Republican form of Governance). FOREIGN AGENTS NOW WORK TO DESTROY AMERICA BEFORE THE PEOPLE FIND OUT WHAT THEY DID TO OUR NATION, OUR PEOPLE AND THE WORLD. SOME ARE WORKING TO RESTORE LAWFUL GOVERNANCE ACROSS THE LAND AND WAKE UP ALL AMERICANS. FOR THE MOST PART, TRUMP APPEARS TO BE AIDING US ALTHOUGH I DO NOT LIKE THE FACT HE IS SURROUNDED BY ISRAEL FIRST ZIO\u2019s et al! ITS TIME TO UNLEARN HOW WE WERE FORGED IN TO THE CURRENT MESS BY ENEMIES DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN\u2026.\n\nBefore I get to the meat of this article, this is a Call to Action! We need your help!

Many people still do not know where they can go to find alternative news! This may include your friends and family\n\nIf the current UNITED STATES c. is rooted in a corporate take over of America in the 1870\u2032s and is a product of the Crown \u2013 Vatican Luciferian Roman Cult usurpation of our nation, then so is ALL that US Corp. created! Which includes the Rothschilds USAF, US ARMY, US NAVY, CIA, FBI, DOJ, NSA etc! Click image below, USAF Corp. is Registered in England NOT America according D&B.\n\nIn other words none of the Alphabet Aparatus was created to protect the Unalienable Rights of the American people. They were protected to perpetuate Mixed War on the American people and to keep us under the thumb of the Cabalistic system! Why do you think Trump has discovered the FBI, COURTS, DOJ and the former Administration was and is at War with Trump! The system was designed to be oberated by servile Crown Puppets like Bush, Obumma et al! It was never designed to tolerate Americans operating as American first Presidents! This is also why the entire Corporate Aparatus is pushing the Anti-American New World Order Strategy! Just yesterday the NWO Media crushed the message of the Front Line Doctors that the Plandemic is manufactured based on fear and that medically their is no reason the Nation should have been locked down. An over the counter cure / Prophylactic has been in existence for 65 years and FAUCI and the NIH were of it since 2005 at least!

We still do not know for sure if Trump and Pompeo are playing the NWO players at this time or if they are aiding the NWO Genocidal maniacs to move forward the NWO! The fact that FAUCI, BIRX, GATES et al are still not behind bars is more than disturbing! It is possible Trump could be playing us all. There are more than enough Red Flags out there concerning his support of Rothschild\u2019s Israel First which are covered in prior posts linked below. Anyone serious about the future of America must ask difficult questions and not ignore what is in front of our eyes! We can not ignore certain troubling details about Trumps failure to do what he said he would do three and half years ago in arresting Clinton, exposing those behind 911 etc: https://www.brighteon.com/2e8804be-e433-412d-a9fa-2eebb9cbddd0\n\nThe following articles and embedded Video\u2019s shreds the Rothschild\u2019s UN-WHO-WEF-CDC Vaccine Corp.

July 28, 2020 (see video below)\n\nExcerpt from the above AAPS Suit: TUCSON, Ariz., July 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ \u2014 This week the Association of American Physicians & Surgeons submitted additional evidence to a federal court for why interference with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) should end by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), in AAPS v. FDA, No. 1:20-cv-00493-RJJ-SJB (W.D. Mich.). \u201cAs confirmed by another recent study of thousands of patients at the Henry Ford Health System in Michigan, HCQ is both very safe and highly effective in treating COVID-19, reducing mortality by 50%,\u201d AAPS informed the court in its filing. \u201cCountries with underdeveloped health care systems are using HCQ early and attaining far lower mortality than in the United States, where [HHS and the FDA] impede access to HCQ.\u201d Yet most Americans are still unable to obtain HCQ for early treatment of COVID-19, and virtually no Americans are able to access it as preventive medicine. HCQ has been used safely for decades by travelers to protect against malaria, but Americans are dying from COVID-19 while HCQ is withheld from them.\n\nVirol J., 2005 Aug 22;2:69. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-2-69.: Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16115318/\n\nThe Free and Independent Nation of Iran allows its people to buy HCQ over the Counter! The alleged Free and Independent Nations of North America does not! Who is really free? Is Freedom in America an illusion sold to us every July 4th, in a PsyOp designed to keep us passive and obedient and trusting of criminals masquerading as \u201cGovernment\u201d? How does any lawful government have the right to stop you buying a $0.26c medicine used all over the world for 60 years that may save your life or that of a loved one. Are we really Free and Independent? Why did those pumping fear porn not want you to know there was a $0.26c solution to GOV ID 1984 PLANDEMIC and that NO ONE needed to die or be locked down? What is really going on in America today? Do you think something is wrong with this picture? Do you think it is time to look in to what went wrong? If so please unlearn and share!\n\nWhy is the NWO Media trying to crush Frontline Doctors evidence on their succesful use of HCQ et al. If an effective cure for COVID is HCQ and it was known all along by Fauci since 2005 and others then the entire Government and Medical Industry is implicated in genocide. We now have to ask to what end would they do this. Because they are RICO and looking to Control humanity and re-engineer our world on a planned criminal narrative aka the New World Order! They have just been caught engaging in crimes against humanity! This ought to burn the NWO down to the ground. See links below on Frontline Doctors presentation from July 27th 2020.

Fauci was well aware of a cure as early as 2005 but he failed to mention this small detail! He instead has been telling the world to wait for a Vaccine for a few hundred dollars when its known they do not work as opposed to tell the world a $.26c pill would do the trick! /awakening-start-here/2020/07/deadly-cover-up-fauci-approved-hydroxy-15-years-ago-to-cure-coronaviruses-nobody-needed-to-die-13752.html\n\nhttps://www.nationalreview.com/corner/professor-lockdown-modeler-resigns-in-disgrace/\n\n/eu/2020/07/sweden-the-one-and-only-chart-that-matters-2659229.html\n\nStrange thing, I don\u2019t see Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx or any other of the supposed main-stream media COVID 19 \u201dexperts\u201d on this list: https://expertscape.com/ex/communicable+disease\n\nLets not even mention the blinding obvious conflicts of interest that Mainstream bought and paid for CIA-ZIO-Media fails to reveal to the world\u2026\n\nNOTE: Many of us publishing on BIN have had accounts suspended on other Social Media DARPA platforms and we have been shadow banned for years.

My rolling Fascist book Ban blocks me from posting to hundreds of Groups that I am member of. These Bans are happening at a time in the life of our nation when the mainstream media and Foreign Black Nobility Powers are conspiring to take down America (the World), burn it to the ground (if they can) and turn our fifty nations states in to a Marxist Zionist Luciferian Cult hell hole.

The Rothschilds UN are telling Americans how to run our nation when they have absolutely NO LAWFUL AUTHORITY to make law in America or violate our organic laws just as Crispy Cream Corp. can not order Americans around! These Rothschilds foreign agents think they have the authority to do so only because seditionists/traitor banned foreign agents signed UN pacts but those banned foreign agents (mostly dummed down never constiutionally trained attorneyss) that signed them had absolutely no authority as Constitiutionally Banned foreign agents themselves to EVER undo Immutable American Organic laws or our Common law system. All Government today are US Corp. agents limited to DC jurisdiction and those violating the laws of our nation are engaged in RICO! They have no lawful authority over the American people! Their authority is predicated on acts of sedition, treason and fraud!\n\nWe are calling on every reader on BIN to share posts found here as far and as wide as you possibly can! Please aid us by getting out the truth to the sleeping masses through all of your own social media sources, email, cell SMS etc! Thanks for your help in waking up the Sleeping Giant and taking back our fifty nation states from Constitutionally banned foreign agents (Duel National Israeli\u2019s, CFR, UN, TLC, Bilderbergers etc) that have for far too long been masquerading as American Governments!\n\nIn order to understand this presentation you need to understand the implications of the Titles of Nobility Act c. 1810.\n\nForeign agents (actors) merely masquerading as Government have no Lawful authority over any of the American people! Here is why.\n\nThe following image shows an excerpt of the original states compact Organic Constitution Article 13 (enacted 1810 and ratified 1819) hidden by those that usurped our lawful Governance in the 1860\u2032s! It is law of the land and can not be revoked by foreign agents / actors aka law breakers! Those violating TONA are lawbreakers and engaged in Sedition and Treason as a result. This topic is covered extensively on 1776Reloaded.org\n\nhttps://1776reloaded.org/joomla30/index.php/us-inc-achilles-heel\n\nOrganic United States Constitution Article XIII, Titles of Nobility Act of 1810, Law by 1819 - never terminated:\n\nThe Original Thirteenth Article of Amendment to the Organic Constitution For The United States of America is:\n\n\u201cIf any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive, or retain any title of nobility or honour, or shall without the consent of Congress, accept and retain any present, pension, office, or emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king, prince, or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United States, and shall be incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under them, or either of them.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that the above applies to any governance office in America, and this includes every Attorney.\n\n[Journal of the Senate] and law by 1819 at this link:\n\nLawbreakers can not change our organic laws, make law or judge others on the actual laws of our nation yet that is what they have been doing since 1819 through fiat, known as color of office, color of law and color of authority! TONA is the foundation of American Constitutional organic law that banned all foreign agents from infiltrating American governance (including all BAR attorneys). Once you realize our nation \u2013 banking and legal systems and all else is ran by banned foreign agents you will realize the enormity of the lies we have been told all of our lives! When you get this, the dominoes will start to fall!\n\nFor the above and all the other reasons stated herein, Americans have a duty pursuant to the Declaration of Independence to NOT COMPLY with any order issued by Constitutionally banned foreign agents / order followers who are guided by foreign powers following Marxist Doctrine invented by the Luciferian Cult and openly published at the Rothschild\u2019s UN-WHO website, the World Economic Forum, the Rockefeller Foundation Website etc,\n\nYou will begin to realize we are being ruled by those who on analysis are for one reason or another a Constitutionally BANNED foreign agent, one BANNED FROM GOVERNMENT IN AMERICA since 1819!\n\nPlease See additional BIN articles below to understand these very important points \u2013 reference TONA = Titles of Nobility Act c. 1810, enacted 1819!\n\nEveryone must realize that mainstream MEDIA is OUR ENEMY and TV is a highly evolved Mind Control Weapononised technology! TV Programming \u2013 ZIONIST Mainstream News like CIA-CNN, CIA-MSNBC, NEW YORK TIMES, ROTHSCHILDS-REUTERS et al is part of the Psychological Mixer War system currently being waged against us all! All so called \u201cnews\u201d is Psychological programming centrally manufactured by Tavistock / Fabian like institutions and distributed to actors pretending to be journalists as revealed in videos below. The institutions behind the so called \u201cNews\u201d are the same parasites that stood up the UN, FED, BIS, WHO, IMF, World Bank, CFR, TLC, Bilderbergers, US Inc., Crown, Vatican et al all operated and under control of the Black Nobility crime families. The same families that run these psycological warfare systems control government and have them pumping out FAKE news as exposed herein:\n\nThe following article by High Impact Flix is being uploaded to Brighteon and will be embedded in to this article in due course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olz03OPeijM&feature=youtu.be\n\nPlease note that all the forces that conspired against the people in prior bloody revolutions cited in the beginning of the above video now move against America and RUN America in violation of the organic laws of our nation! Their goal is to genocide Americans just as they did the nations featured in the video!

The plot is confirmed by the devastation suffered by both Jews and Gentiles. Most Jews are not privy to this plot while many goyim (Freemasons, our \u201cleaders\u201d) are willing to join it. Below is a suppressed 1869 document, \u201cIn the Jewish Cemetery of Prague\u201d which reveals that the Jewish leadership hated Christianity for preventing them from \u201creigning over the whole world\u201d as God supposedly promised Abraham\u2026\n\nI was very pleased to see that David Steal recently posted articles that revealed he like other hard core researchers with decades of research behind them have come to the same conclusions as to who stands behind most of the worlds atrocities: https://phibetaiota.net/2020/07/zionist-tricks-1-video-121-anti-semitic-its-a-trick-we-always-use-it-former-israeli-minister-shulamit-aloni/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf you found out today that someone was trying to kill you, your family, your community etc., what would you do about it?\n\nMake no mistake about it - Shadow Government (Black Nobility Cabal over the Holy See/Vatican/Crown) wants you, your family, your community and the people of all nations dead!

The Luciferian cabal have been Genociding us through through Silent War / Mixed War techniques and Lawfare for decades (See definitions link below). Our nation and all others have been ran by our enemies for a very long time! They took control through the money and legal systems and then they took over everything else.

Please take this date and make the Supervisors in your County Responsible for all impacts caused by 5G if they can not prove that they have carried out safety oversight before rolling out 5G!\n\nImage from a recently deployed 5G Installation in England:\n\nVideo: https://www.brighteon.com/0be4f6ec-8891-4a03-92a2-38213ed10077\n\nWireless Wake up Call: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0NEaPTu9oI\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/we-have-no-reason-to-believe-5g-is-safe/\n\nNote that Bill Clinton signed the Telecommunications Act of 1996. It alleged to have prohibited cities and municipalities from regulating the placement of cell towers due to health and environmental concerns. Yet, Bill Clinton or any other \u201cACTOR\u201d as you will see had NO SUCH AUTHORITY to make law or mitigate our Organic laws! Please onboard this reality!\n\nIt has long been my hypothesis that the Luciferian Talmudic Zionist Roman cult that took over our nation in the 1860\u2032s through a silent coup are openly engaged in deploying genocide technologies across America and the world. Modalities may include Chemtrail smart dust / Toxins, Vaccine induced Toxins & Heavy Metals +. Those that once in our bodies (some able to cross the Blood \u2013 Brain Barrier) could be triggered as a remotely controlled mechanism designed to induce what would be assumed to be a natural occurring disease. This is in fact what is happening with all disease caused by Vaccines is it not! Higher incidences of death post the Luciferian Cult induced vaccine culture and simply put down to natural causes instead of the elephant in the room, the vaccine!\n\nHere is a book written in1889 called \u201c45 years of Registration Statistics, Proving Vaccination to be both useless and dangerous\u201d. It covers 45 years (so starting in the year 1844) the statistics of vaccine FAILURES including an INCREASE in death from other diseases once the blood has been poisoned by vaccination. They cover the health of the vaccinated VERSES the UNvaccinated\u2026..bad news for the vaccinated\u2026they were dying more from other diseases such as measles, mumps, smallpox and diphtheria because of a weakened countenance from vaccines. This was covered 128 years ago.\n\nOh and all you \u201cThe science is settled on Vaccines\u201d They were designed by the pushers of Pharma poison to kill and maime us: https://ia802703.us.archive.org/31/items/b2136140x/b2136140x.pdf\n\nScientists have produced evidence of nano-bots present in vaccines / food and Chemtrail poisoned air. These Genocide technologies could easily be designed to work together such that they lay in waiting in our bodies until hit with a certain frequency Trigger broadcast from Cell and other antenas (5G?) which could be designed to specifically excite the manmade pathogen that has been unleashed to infiltrate its in to our bodies. Perhaps by the means of even a GOV ID 1984 TEST.\n\nJust consider how a cell tower causes your cell phone to \u201cring\u201d when the right signal is broadcast to your phone! Now consider an Oxygen atom, nano-bot or other compound being activated when it is hit by the right frequency broadcast to it from some remote antenna!\n\nDo you remember the stories coming out of Wuhan? Were they not engaged in a massive 5G test of some 10K 5G Towers which were on the back of a vaccination program?\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/china/video-2094890/Video-Dramatic-footage-shows-people-collapsing-suddenly-Wuhan-city.html\n\nAlso consider just as your cell phone is the only one that rings when the signal is sent to it by a caller. What if the parasites could beam a carefully intended frequency to a specified cell phone vicinity belonging to a certain individual or to a larger geography like a specific building complex? What an efficient way for parasites to kill off targeted individuals that are causing the cabal problems! I think something like this was exposed in a marvel movie!\n\n[ Uploaded to Brighteon 1776Reloaded channel: https://www.brighteon.com/channels/1776reloaded\n\nhttps://www.brighteon.com/9ec88d73-78f7-40fb-8a32-9cd62f015e2e\n\nWe know the parasites already have the capabilities to engage us in such evil! Some may think that even the parasites would not stoop to such a low to openly genocide humanity so that they could claim the world for themselves! Think again! It has long been their plan to genocide non cult members. If you have not yet figured this out you have not been paying attention!\n\nIf cult members would kidnap and terrorize children literally to death and put them in your hamburger meat do you not think they are capable of rolling our a global multi layered Genocide technology to kill off several Billion people?

Shared here for education purposes. Please visit the original article. Additional notes from 1776Reloaded.org can be found below this article.\n\nJamie White | Infowars.com\n\nJULY 22, 2020\n\nhttps://www.infowars.com/nih-admits-5g-can-actually-create-coronavirus-within-human-cells/\n\n\u201cAn international study shared on the National Institute of Health website found that 5G technology is absorbed by skin cells and can alter DNA in a way that actually produces coronaviruses within the human body.\u201d\n\nAn international study shared on the National Institute of Health website found that 5G technology is absorbed by skin cells and can alter DNA in a way that actually produces coronaviruses within the human body.\n\nThe study, jointly produced by scientists from Guglielmo Marconi University, Central Michigan University and First Moscow State Medical University, claims that 5G millimeter waves stimulate DNA in a way that causes cell nuclei to produce coronaviruses.\n\nNOTE - as of this update on July 27, 2020 AD PUB MED has pulled the above article. Now why would they do that:\n\n\u201cIn this research, we show that 5G millimeter waves could be absorbed by dermatologic cells acting like antennas, transferred to other cells and play the main role in producing Coronaviruses in biological cells,\u201d the study states.\n\nDavid Knight breaks down the groundbreaking new NIH report that sheds more light on what the 5G/Coronavirus connection might be.\n\n\u201cDNA is built from charged electrons and atoms and has an inductor-like structure. This structure could be divided into linear, toroid and round inductors. Inductors interact with external electromagnetic waves, move and produce some extra waves within the cells. The shapes of these waves are similar to shapes of hexagonal and pentagonal bases of their DNA source. These waves produce some holes in liquids within the nucleus. To fill these holes, some extra hexagonal and pentagonal bases are produced. These bases could join to each other and form virus-like structures such as Coronavirus.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo produce these viruses within a cell, it is necessary that the wavelength of external waves be shorter than the size of the cell. Thus 5G millimeter waves could be good candidates for applying in constructing virus-like structures such as Coronaviruses (COVID-19) within cells.\u201d\n\nThe study goes on to suggest that the cancer-causing qualities of 5G are due to how it alters DNA within the body.\n\n\u201cIn another study, it was argued that 5G technologies cause great harm to human health. Cancer is only one of the many problems. 5G causes 720 (factorial) different diseases in human beings, and can kill everything that lives except some forms of microorganisms (12). To consider the effects of 5G millimeter waves on biological systems, we propose a model which describes the process of exchanging waves between 5G towers and host cells.\u201d\n\nAs Infowars reported over 6 months ago, Wuhan, the global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, rolled out 5G systems just weeks before the COVID-19 outbreak hit, with some scientists claiming that 5G\u2019s effects on human cells can cause \u201cflu-like symptoms.\u201d\n\nConcerns about 5G\u2019s role with coronavirus were even raised by Hollywood stars like Woody Harrelson, who shared a study in April suggesting a \u201ccausal\u201d relationship between 5G systems and the coronavirus.\n\nPART IV: LASTLY, WHY ARE THE SICK BASTARDS RUNNING THE WORLD FROM BEHIND THE SHADOWS SO DESPERATE TO CAUSE A 2nd WAVE BEYOND KILLING OFF THE PEOPLE PER AGENDA 21 - 2020.\n\nANSWER, BECAUSE ITS THE EXCUSE THEY NEED TO INSTALL A TECHNOCRATIC NWO CONTROL GRID AND PAYMENT SYSTEM OVER SOCIETY LIKE THAT INSTALLED IN CHINA. ONCE THAT IS INSTALLED ITS AS GOOD AS GAME OVER FOR HUMANITY! WE WILL NOT BE FREE AGAIN UNTIL THE PARASITES ARE DEALT WITH!\n\nThe following two Videos expose the horrific control system to come if the seditionous and treasonous NWO agenda is not derailed and the parasites behind tried for crimes agaist humanity\n\n\"Must review video.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1EVs2GMsRg\n\nSupporting documents\n\n*** Today's Story Links *** Michigan Passes Controversial Bill To Microchip Humans Voluntarily \"To Protect Their Privacy\"\n\nhttps://www.zerohedge.com/technology/...

We can clean the (((virus))) from our planet including their lineages so fast if we just find a way to activate this malleable giant cell called Society against the (((cancer))). For example small countries like Portugal would achieve this in a week or less if only people knew 1% of what these kikes have been doing to us for millennia they would gladly erase them just like they did 109 times in 89 locations\u2026 The problem is they don\u2019t know. You activate the cells you show them the truth and the body will clean the (((cancer))) without the big brains or leaders in our side lifting one single finger. What are we doing to gather people in sites like Zoom where we can create lectures and interact with the normies by answering their questions?! Now is the time, probably the last chance we have. Lets go down in History like the ones who began the great (((decancering))) of the planet\u2026 Actions not words, honour and courage not cowardice, no quarters instead of forgiving/leaving little cancer cells around that can grow all over again. Do you wanna go down as one of the bravest generations of all time or as the greatest cowards that ever lived? THINK about it.\u2013\n\nThis is OUR time OUR chance. Dont waste it.\n\n\u201cJews\u201d are NOT the \u201chouse of Judah\u201d, they are in reality the offspring of cain and have literally nothing to do with the 12 tribes of Israel (which includes Judah).\n\nRev. 2:9 (properly translated) : \u2026.\u201dthem which say they are (of) Judah, and are not, but (are) the SYNAGOGUE of Satan.\u201d\n\nRev. 3:9 (properly translated): \u201cBehold, I will make them of the SYNAGOGUE of Satan, that say they are Judah, and are not, but do lie\u2026\u201d\n\nSo the \u201cjews\u201d try to falsely imply that (((they))) are the tribe of Judah by calling themselves \u201cjews\u201d, and they are not the tribe of Judah, and what\u2019s funny is (((they))) also claim to be all of \u201cIsrael\u201d, they are NOT Judah OR Israel, but notice the hypocrisy, how they say they are Judah, then turn around and claim to be ALL 12 tribes at the same time!!! Its laughable!!\n\nNotice also the word \u201cSynagogue\u201d, the Greek word that is there IS \u201cSunagoge\u201d, that\u2019s \u201cSynagogue\u201d. Anywhere it speaks of Christian \u201cChurch\u201d in Greek the word would be \u201cEkklesia\u201d. But notice that the word for \u201csynagogue\u201d in Greek IS synagogue\u2026.let me ask you, who are the ONLY \u201cpeople\u201d upon the earth that go to a building that they call a \u201csynagogue\u201d?!?!???!!!

(((they))) also admit in their own 1977 edition of the \u201cencyclopedia judaica\u201d that they are the (mongrel) descendants of Esau (that race mixed). Also, in their own words \u201cStrictly speaking it is incorrect to call an ancient Israelite a \u2018Jew\u2019 or to call a contemporary Jew an Israelite or a Hebrew.\u201d (1980 Jewish Almanac, p. 3), AND \u201cJews began to call themselves Hebrews and Israelites in 1860\u2033 \u2014Encyclopedia Judaica 1971 Vol 10:23. In 1867, the Jew Abraham Harkavy, in \u201cThe Jews and Languages of the Slavs,\u201d said that the Jewish Yiddish language came from the Khazars, not the Hebrews.\n\nNotice that Christ said that (((they))) were responsible for ALL of the righteous blood shed upon the earth.\n\nTo pretend that \u201cits not all Jews\u201d is a huge deception, as it certainly OVER 94% OF THE JEWS. It doesnt matter what some Jews may be (supposedly) against, the facts are (((they))) are the offspring of the devil itself. The most sad point in world history would be that if we got to the point that we took back control of this planet as Aryans should, that we\u2019d leave one jew alive to breed all of this evil mass murder of Aryans into existence again at some point in the future.\n\nNo we are not all the same, and the worst mistake that anyone could make is to overlook the spiritual significance and aspect of the entire thing, because the sickness of the Jew does not lie on the outside where you can see it (all of the times), but it lies WITHIN, in the satanic evil spirit that they possess, (((they))) are literally of their father the devil, that\u2019s reality\u2026to ignore that leaves everyone in a state of confusion and lack of understanding.", "link": "https://beforeitsnews.com/prophecy/2020/07/in-the-name-of-zion-full-documentary-awesome-video-everyone-should-see-2512767.html", "author": ["The Last Trumpet", "Stellar Prophet"]}, {"title": "Secret Police Are Taking Hostages.

Someday time will run out and \u201cthe Big One\u201d will finally strike, and the devastation will be far more immense than most people would dare to imagine. Over the last 7 days, there have been 1,957 earthquakes in California and Nevada, but the one that everyone is talking about is the magnitude 4.2 earthquake that just shook up Los Angeles. According to ABC News, this quake was large enough to trigger \u201calerts from the state\u2019s new quake warning system\u201d\u2026\n\nA magnitude 4.2 earthquake gave the Los Angeles region a predawn wake-up call Thursday, triggering local alerts from the state\u2019s new quake warning system but resulting in no reports of significant damage. The 4:29 a.m. jolt was centered in the northern San Fernando Valley and occurred at a depth of 5.5 miles (8.9 kilometers), the U.S. Geological Survey said. Dozens of aftershocks followed.\n\nThe good news is that nobody died, but millions of people throughout the region were definitely deeply alarmed when they felt it.\n\nAfter experiencing tremendous shaking at her house, Khloe Kardashian posted her startled reaction on Twitter\u2026\n\nA number of celebrities who were jolted awake by the tremors shared their reactions on Twitter, including Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, who said the event felt much more serious than the official numbers suggested. \u201cOh man!! Wow that felt much bigger than a 4.5 #earthquake. So scary!\u201d Kardashian, 36, tweeted. \u201cSneakers and my flashlight by my bed.\u201d\n\nIf she thought that quake was really bad, just wait until she sees what is coming.\n\nAccording to the USGS, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake would be 63,095 times bigger than the quake that just happened, and it would be 15,848,931 times more powerful.\n\nOf course we don\u2019t know if \u201cthe Big One\u201d will be exactly that magnitude, but I wanted to give you some idea of how incredibly destructive it will be when it arrives.\n\nFor decades, California residents have been warned about \u201cthe Big One\u201d, and it hasn\u2019t happened yet. So a lot of people have been lulled into a false sense of security, and that is a huge mistake.\n\nScientists continue to assure us that it is just a matter of time before it strikes. In fact, Dr. Michio Kaku insists that \u201cthe Big One\u201d is \u201cway overdue\u201d\u2026\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cThe last Big One in the LA area was in 1680, over 300 years ago.\u201d \u201cThe average cycle time for big earthquakes on the San Andreas fault is 135 years. We are way overdue.\u201c\n\nAnd when it arrives, it could literally devastate the entire California coastline.\n\nAccording to Fox News, one study found that the full length of the San Andreas fault could potentially \u201cunzip all at once\u201d\u2026.\n\nFor years, scientists believed the mighty San Andreas\u2014the 800-mile-long fault running the length of California where the Pacific and North American plates meet\u2014could only rupture in isolated sections. But a recent study by federal, state and academic researchers showed that much of the fault could unzip all at once, unleashing a rare, singular catastrophe. Now, insurers have used that research to come up with a new analysis of the damage that could be caused by statewide break of the San Andreas.\n\nIf such a seismic event took place, would part of California snap off like a cracker and fall into the Pacific Ocean like many people believe?\n\nNo, that is not the way that it works.\n\nHowever, there is no denying that vast portions of southern California are just barely above sea level, and scientists tell us that there have been earthquakes in the past that have caused parts of southern California to suddenly sink by as much as three feet.\n\nIf a large enough earthquake happened and huge areas of southern California were suddenly several feet below sea level, there wouldn\u2019t be anything to keep the Pacific Ocean from rushing in. It would truly be a nightmare scenario, and one team of scientists found that such a scenario is actually quite realistic\u2026\n\nThe Big One may be overdue to hit California, but scientists near LA have found a new risk for the area during a major earthquake. They claim that if a major tremor hits the area, it could plunge large parts of California into the sea almost instantly.\n\nCal State Fullerton professor Matt Kirby was one of the scientists that worked on that study, and he says that the process would \u201chappen relatively instantaneously\u201d\u2026\n\n\u2018It\u00b4s something that would happen relatively instantaneously,\u2019 Kirby said. \u2018Probably today if it happened, you would see seawater rushing in.\u2019\n\nIf you live in southern California, that should chill you to the core.\n\nBecause this is not just a theoretical exercise. As I detail in my brand new book, this will happen someday.\n\nWe are moving into a time of increased seismic activity, and the entire globe will be shaken as extremely violent seismic events erupt with frightening regularity.\n\nResidents of the west coast need to especially be concerned, because the entire west coast sits directly along the infamous \u201cRing of Fire\u201d. In addition to a massive earthquake along the San Andreas fault, scientists are also warning us that it is just a matter of time before there is a colossal seismic event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone, and there are signs that several volcanoes along the west coast (including Mt. Rainier) are starting to reawaken.\n\nIn addition, we should also keep a close eye on Mt. Popocatepetl down in Mexico, because it has been belching clouds of hot ash with alarming regularity lately.\n\nOf course the mockers will continue to mock the scientific warnings and they will continue to mock articles like this until the day comes when they aren\u2019t able to mock anymore.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to believe what I am telling you, and you just want to cling to the belief that everything will be just fine somehow, go ahead and do that.\n\nAnd tomorrow when you wake up everything probably will be just fine.\n\nBut one disaster will suddenly strike, and at that moment you will realize that you should have heeded the warnings while you still had the chance.\n\n*It is finally here!

In a new study published in Nature Communications, researchers reveal that given the right food in the right laboratory conditions, microbes collected from sediment as old as 100 million years can revive and multiply, even after laying dormant since large dinosaurs prowled the planet.\n\nYuki Morono (left) and Steven D\u2019Hondt (far right) aboard the research drillship JOIDES Resolution with sediment cores gathered from the South Pacific Gyre.\n\nPhoto courtesy of IODP JRSO\n\nThe research team behind the new study, from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), the URI Graduate School of Oceanography, the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, the Kochi University and Marine Works Japan, gathered the ancient sediment samples ten years ago during an expedition to the South Pacific Gyre, the part of the ocean with the lowest productivity and fewest nutrients available to fuel the marine food web.\n\n\u201cOur main question was whether life could exist in such a nutrient-limited environment or if this was a lifeless zone,\u201d said the paper\u2019s lead author Yuki Morono, senior scientist at JAMSTEC. \u201cAnd we wanted to know how long the microbes could sustain their life in a near-absence of food.\u201d\n\nOn the seafloor, there are layers of sediment consisting of marine snow (organic debris continually sourced from the sea surface), dust, and particles carried by the wind and ocean currents. Small life forms such as microbes become trapped in this sediment.\n\nAboard the research drillship JOIDES Resolution, the team drilled numerous sediment cores 100 meters below the seafloor and nearly 6,000 meters below the ocean\u2019s surface. The scientists found that oxygen was present in all of the cores, suggesting that if sediment accumulates slowly on the seafloor at a rate of no more than a meter or two every million years, oxygen will penetrate all the way from the seafloor to the basement. Such conditions make it possible for aerobic microorganisms\u2014those that require oxygen to live\u2014to survive for geological time scales of millions of years.\n\nWith fine-tuned laboratory procedures, the scientists, led by Morono, incubated the samples to coax their microbes to grow. The results demonstrated that rather than being fossilized remains of life, the microbes in the sediment had survived, and were capable of growing and dividing.\n\n\u201cWe knew that there was life in deep sediment near the continents where there\u2019s a lot of buried organic matter,\u201d said URI Graduate School of Oceanography professor and co-author of the study Steven D\u2019Hondt. \u201cBut what we found was that life extends in the deep ocean from the seafloor all the way to the underlying rocky basement.\u201d\n\nMorono was initially taken aback by the results. \u201cAt first I was skeptical, but we found that up to 99.1% of the microbes in sediment deposited 101.5 million years ago were still alive and were ready to eat,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the newly developed ability to grow, manipulate and characterize ancient microorganisms, the research team is looking forward to applying a similar approach to other questions about the geological past. According to Morono, life for microbes in the subseafloor is very slow compared to life above it, and so the evolutionary speed of these microbes will be slower. \u201cWe want to understand how or if these ancient microbes evolved,\u201d he said. \u201cThis study shows that the subseafloor is an excellent location to explore the limits of life on Earth.\u201d\n\nBefore looking ahead to future research, D\u2019Hondt took time to reflect on Morono\u2019s achievement. \u201cWhat\u2019s most exciting about this study is that it shows that there are no limits to life in the old sediment of the world\u2019s ocean,\u201d said D\u2019Hondt. \u201cIn the oldest sediment we\u2019ve drilled, with the least amount of food, there are still living organisms, and they can wake up, grow and multiply.\u201d\n\nThis study was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Funding Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researchers, and the U.S. National Science Foundation.

I also address stunning new data about the real risks, or lack thereof, to teachers from children returning to school. I also address Joe Biden\u2019s devastating plan for the suburbs.\n\nYep, I know, we\u2019re still behind by three episodes here. You do not know how tempting it is for me to skip ahead and get caught up! However, that wouldn\u2019t be a good thing, especially if any of us miss an episode that could contain valuable information. And, from what I\u2019ve learned, there is something for everyone in every episode. That is kind of how I make my decisions on what parts to write about. Were you aware of that? If you have been following this blog, there is no doubt in my mind that you know that. And you would know that there may be something in Dan\u2019s show that means more to you than to me, and vice versa.\n\nWith that being said, even after you read my posts, you should watch the whole show if you haven\u2019t already. Heck, maybe it is even better to read what I\u2019m thinking after you watch the whole show, whether you agree or not with what I take away from the episode. As you probably know by now, Dan has a lot of information packed into each show, and they are broken up into segments that are easy to get to, should you have a link. What I\u2019m going to try doing from this point on, is give you the links to the segments that I discuss in this blog. I know how to do that, it\u2019s really easy. And it is even easier for you to click on the link that I provide and go right to that segment or point that I want to emphasize. Sound cool? There is only one thing, though, the video will continue to play from the starting point; there\u2019s no end point. You get what I\u2019m saying, right? You just may watch much more of the episode (maybe again) than you had planned. That\u2019s actually a good thing.\n\nIn this episode, there are several blocks that I want emphasize, but the big one is right at the beginning, regarding the three-year old girl that was shot. Oh, which one? Dan will tell you how he does a search, and gets multiple results of three year olds that have been shot. That\u2019s right. And then, the gangland-style shooting in broad daylight in Chicago. And people (advisors?) were telling the President that he shouldn\u2019t send in Federal agents in to help clean up the messes that mayors and local governments have created, all on their own. The erroneous advice is based on the \u201cPottery barn theory,\u201d which is, \u201cyou break it, you own it.\u201d The trouble is, it doesn\u2019t apply here, as the cities are already broken.\n\nNow, there\u2019s much more, really. And this segment may be the key takeaway. If you live in the suburbs and you are a wealthy liberal, here is what is coming your way. Pay close attention. What Joe Biden has planned for you may not be for your benefit.\n\nI am really praying that you have seen this complete episode, beginning to end, or that you will.

Add your two cents.\n\n\n\n\n\nby N.Morgan\n\nWho knew something as simple as baking soda could treat a plethora of illnesses and diseases, like Cancer? Even the most aggressive cancers which have metastasized have been reversed with baking soda cancer treatments. Although chemotherapy is toxic to all cells, it represents the only measure that oncologists employ in their practice to almost all cancer patients. In fact, 9 out of 10 cancer patients agree to chemotherapy first without investigating other less invasive options.\n\nDoctors and pharmaceutical companies make money from it. That\u2019s the only reason chemotherapy is still used. Not because it\u2019s effective, decreases morbidity, mortality or diminishes any specific cancer rates. In fact, it does the opposite. Chemotherapy boosts cancer growth and long-term mortality rates and oncologists know it.\n\nA few years ago, the University of Arizona Cancer Center member Dr. Mark Pagel received a $2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the effectiveness of personalized baking soda cancer treatment for breast cancer. Obviously there are people in the know who have understood that sodium bicarbonate, that same stuff that can save a person\u2019s life in the emergency room in a heartbeat, is a primary cancer treatment option of the safest and most effective kind.\n\nStudies have shown that dietary measures to boost bicarbonate levels can increase the pH of acidic tumors without upsetting the pH of the blood and healthy tissues. Animal models of human breast cancer show that oral sodium bicarbonate does indeed make tumors more alkaline and inhibit metastasis. Based on these studies, plus the fact that baking soda is safe and well-tolerated, world-renowned doctors such as Dr. Julian Whitaker have adopted successful cancer treatment protocols as part of an overall nutritional and immune support program for patients who are dealing with the disease.\n\nThe Whitaker protocol uses 12 g (2 rounded teaspoons) of baking soda mixed in 2 cups water, along with a low-cal sweetener of your choice. (It\u2019s quite salty tasting.) Sip this mixture over the course of an hour or two and repeat for a total of three times a day. One man claims he has found a cure for cancer using baking soda and molasses and actually successfully treated his own disease by using baking soda.\n\nWhen taken orally with water, especially water with high magnesium content, and when used transdermally in medicinal baths, sodium bicarbonate becomes a first-line medicinal for the treatment of cancer, and also kidney disease, diabetes, influenza, and even the common cold. It is also a powerful buffer against radiation exposure, so everyone should be up to speed on its use. Everybody\u2019s physiology is under heavy nuclear attack from strong radioactive winds that are circling the northern hemisphere.\n\nDr. Robert J. Gillies and his colleagues have already demonstrated that pre-treatment of mice with baking soda results in the alkalinization of the area around tumors. The same researchers reported that bicarbonate increases tumor pH and also inhibits spontaneous metastases in mice with breast cancer.\n\nWhat is Baking Soda?\n\nBaking soda is a white crystalline solid that appears as a fine powder. It is also called cooking soda, bread soda, and bicarbonate of soda. Its chemical name is sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydrogen carbonate.\n\nBaking soda is different from washing soda (sodium carbonate) although they share the same slightly salty and alkaline taste.\n\nThis widely used soda is commonly dissolved in mineral water and used as a leavening agent in baking. It works as a leavening agent by neutralizing the acidic components of batter. The neutralization releases carbon dioxide and leads to the \u201craising\u201d or expansion of baked foods.\n\nBaking soda has also been used to soften vegetables and to tenderize meat.\n\nAs a household chemical, baking soda is used as a cleaning agent. It is included in toothpaste for similar reasons where it serves as an antiseptic, acid-neutralizer, whitening agent, and plaque-removing agent as well as a cleaning agent.\n\nOther common personal hygiene products in which baking soda can be found include deodorants and shampoos.\n\nBaking Soda and pH Medicine\n\nThe pH of our tissues and body fluids is crucial and central because it affects and mirrors the state of our health or our inner cleanliness. The closer the pH is to 7.35-7.45, the higher our level of health and wellbeing. Staying within this range dramatically increases our ability to resist acute illnesses like colds and flues as well as the onset of cancer and other diseases. Keeping our pH within a healthy range also involves the necessary lifestyle and dietary changes that will protect us over the long term while the use of sodium bicarbonate gives us a jump-start toward increased alkalinity.\n\nThe pH scale is like a thermometer showing increases and decreases in the acid and alkaline content of fluids. Deviations above or below a 7.35-7.45 pH range in the tightly controlled blood can signal potentially serious and dangerous symptoms or states of disease.\n\nWhen the body can no longer effectively neutralize and eliminate the acids, it relocates them within the body\u2019s extra-cellular fluids and connective tissue cells directly compromising cellular integrity. Conversely, when the body becomes too alkaline from too much bicarbonate in the blood, metabolic alkalosis occurs, which can lead to severe consequences if not corrected quickly.\n\nJon Barron presents a way of looking at a pH that opens up one of the major benefits of alkaline water:\n\nHydrogen ions tie up oxygen. That means that the more acid a liquid is, the less available the oxygen in it. Every cell in our body requires oxygen for life and to maintain optimum health. Combine that with what we know about hydrogen ions and we see that the more acid the blood (the lower its pH), the less oxygen is available for use by the cells. Without going into a discussion of the chemistry involved, just understand that it\u2019s the same mechanism involved when acid rain \u201ckills\u201d a lake. The fish literally suffocate to death because the acid in the lake \u201cbinds up\u201d all of the available oxygen. It\u2019s not that the oxygen has gone anywhere; it\u2019s just no longer available. Conversely, if you raise the pH of the lake (make it more alkaline), oxygen is now available and the lake comes back to life. Incidentally, it\u2019s worth noting that cancer is related to an acid environment (lack of oxygen)\u2013the higher the pH (the more oxygen present in the cells of the body), the harder it is for cancer to thrive.\n\nUnderstanding this is important for two reasons: (1) it reveals one of the primary benefits of alkaline water\u2013more \u201cavailable\u201d oxygen in the system and (2) it explains why alkaline water helps fight cancer.\n\nHow Baking Soda Can Help \u201cCure\u201d Cancer\n\nBasically, malignant tumors represent masses of rapidly growing cells. The rapid rate of growth experienced by these cells means that cellular metabolism also proceeds at very high rates.\n\nTherefore, cancer cells are using a lot more carbohydrates and sugars to generate energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).\n\nHowever, some of the compounds formed from energy production include lactic acid and pyruvic acid. Under normal circumstances, these compounds are cleared and utilized as soon as they are produced. But cancer cells are experiencing metabolism at a much faster rate. Therefore, these organic acids accumulate in the immediate environment of the tumor.\n\nThe high level of extracellular acidity around the tumor is one of the chief driving forces behind the metastasis of cancer tumors.\n\nBasically, cancer cells need an acidic environment to grow and spread rapidly.\n\nSome cancer experts, therefore, believe that by buffering the tumor microenvironment with an alkalizing compound, the pH of tumors can be raised enough to starve them and stop their growth and spread.\n\nCuriously, this rather simple solution to cancer has been proven right.\n\nWhat is even more remarkable is that there is no need to cook up some fancy synthetic drug to lower the acidity in the immediate environment of the tumor. A simple, commonly obtained compound like sodium bicarbonate will do.\n\nObviously, it is desirable to deliver the sodium bicarbonate as close to the tumor as possible since its pH-raising effect is needed in the microenvironment of the tumor. Therefore, directly injecting sodium bicarbonate in the tumor site is considered a better solution than oral administration. However, oral sodium bicarbonate is just safer and can be readily used at home.\n\nA 2009 study published in the journal, Cancer Research, is among the first to confirm that the alkalinizing effect of sodium bicarbonate can indeed stop cancer.\n\nBy injecting sodium bicarbonate into a group of mice, the authors of the study were able to determine how the growth and spread of cancer tumors were effected by raising the pH of the organ affected by cancer.\n\nThe study results showed that baking soda indeed raised the pH and reduced spontaneous metastases in mice induced with breast cancer.\n\nThe researchers also determined that sodium bicarbonate works by raising the pH outside cells and not within cells. This is an important finding because it suggests that sodium bicarbonate does not interfere with cellular metabolism even as it makes the microenvironment unconducive for tumor growth.\n\nOther findings from this study show that baking soda:\n\nReduced the involvement of the lymph node on the transport of cancer cells\n\nDoes not lower the levels of circulating tumor cells\n\nReduced the involvement of the liver and, therefore, the spread of tumor cells to other organs\n\nInhibit the colonization of other organs by circulating tumor cells\n\nThe Baking Soda Formula for Cancer\n\nTo make the baking soda natural cancer remedy at home, you need maple syrup, molasses or honey to go along with the baking soda.\n\nIn Dr. Sircus\u2019 book, he documented how one patient used baking soda and blackstrap molasses to fight the prostate cancer that had metastasized to his bones. On the first day, the patient mixed 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 1 teaspoon of molasses in a cup of water.\n\nHe took this for another 3 days after which his saliva pH read 7.0 and his urine pH read 7.5.\n\nEncouraged by these results, the patient took the solution 2 times on day 5 instead of once daily. And from day 6 \u2013 10, he took 2 teaspoons each of baking soda and molasses twice daily.\n\nBy the 10th day, the patient\u2019s pH had risen to 8.5 and the only side effects experienced were headaches and night sweat (similar to cesium therapy).\n\nThe next day, the patient had a bone scan and too other medical tests. His results showed that his PSA (prostate-specific antigen, the protein used to determine the severity of prostate enlargement and prostate cancer) level was down from 22.3 at the point of diagnosis to 0.1.\n\nAnother baking soda formula recommends mixing 90 teaspoons of maple syrup with 30 teaspoons of baking soda.\n\nTo do this, the maple syrup must be heated to become less viscous. Then the baking syrup is added and stirred for 5 minutes until it is fully dissolved.\n\nThis preparation should provide about 10-day worth of the baking soda remedy. 5 \u2013 7 teaspoons per day is the recommended dose for cancer patients.\n\nCare should be taken when using the baking soda remedy to treat cancer. This is because sustaining a high pH level can itself cause metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte imbalance. These can result in edema and also affect the heart and blood pressure.\n\nOne does not have to be a doctor to practice pH medicine. Every practitioner of the healing arts and every mother and father needs to understand how to use sodium bicarbonate. Bicarbonate deficiency is a real problem that deepens with age so it really does pay to understand and appreciate what baking soda is all about.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://preventdisease.com/news/15/070215_Oncologists-Dont-Like-Baking-Soda-Cancer-Treatment-Too-Effective-Cheap.shtml\n\ncancertutor.com\n\nphkillscancer.com\n\ndrsircus.com\n\ndrleonardcoldwell.com\n\ndrwhitaker.com\n\nDave Mihalovic is a Naturopathic Doctor who specializes in vaccine research, cancer prevention and a natural approach to treatment.\n\nStories Contributed by N.

The findings have implications for the prevention of future pandemics stemming from this lineage.\n\n\u201cCoronaviruses have genetic material that is highly recombinant, meaning different regions of the virus\u2019s genome can be derived from multiple sources,\u201d said Maciej Boni, associate professor of biology, Penn State. \u201cThis has made it difficult to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2\u2032s origins. You have to identify all the regions that have been recombining and trace their histories. To do that, we put together a diverse team with expertise in recombination, phylogenetic dating, virus sampling, and molecular and viral evolution.\u201d\n\nThe team used three different bioinformatic approaches to identify and remove the recombinant regions within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Next, they reconstructed phylogenetic histories for the non-recombinant regions and compared them to each other to see which specific viruses have been involved in recombination events in the past. They were able to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between SARS-CoV-2 and its closest known bat and pangolin viruses. Their findings appear today (July 28) in Nature Microbiology.\n\nThe researchers found that the lineage of viruses to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs diverged from other bat viruses about 40-70 years ago. Importantly, although SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar (about 96%) to the RaTG13 coronavirus, which was sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis horseshoe bat in 2013 in Yunnan province, China, the team found that it diverged from RaTG13 a relatively long time ago, in 1969.\n\n\n\nBy reconstructing the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, an international research team of Chinese, European and U.S. scientists has discovered that the lineage that gave rise to the virus has been circulating in bats for decades and likely includes other viruses with the ability to infect humans.", "link": "https://beforeitsnews.com/health/2020/07/researchers-identify-evolutionary-origins-of-sars-cov-2-first-emerged-40-70-years-ago-3033934.html", "author": ["Alton Parrish"]}, {"title": "The Books The Deep State Hopes You\u2019ll Never Read (Video)", "text": "\n\n\n\nby N.Morgan\n\nIt isn\u2019t really a surprise that there are books detailing certain parts of history that the government would like to see destroyed. There are books that get heavily promoted, wind up on bestseller lists everywhere before the ink has even dried on the pages, and you randomly see everyone at the airport carrying a copy under their arm as if they are being handed out for free with the plane tickets. And then there are books like the ones on this list that, if the establishment gets its way, you will never so much as lay eyes on.\n\n1. 63 Documents the Government Doesn\u2019t Want You to Read\n\nSure, the title makes it seem pretty obvious, but I\u2019ve got to wonder if people passed this one up largely based on the polarizing conspiracy figure that Jesse Ventura has become.\n\nThe book itself is filled with an eye-opening array (a primer if you will) of actual government documents that paint a picture of who our government does and does not represent. The people? No. Continuity of government, military-industrial complex and megacorporations? Absolutely.\n\nIt includes such amazing tidbits as \u201cThe CIA\u2019s Secret Assassination Manual,\u201d \u201cCIA \u2018Propaganda Notes\u2019 on the Kennedy Assassination,\u201d \u201cMilitary Experiments on Our Own Troops,\u201d \u201cFixing the Vote in Ohio,\u201d \u201cAn Internet Kill Switch?,\u201d and a bevy of false flag info from Operation Northwoods to 9/11 to Gulf of Tonkin and more.\n\nOh, and plenty of info on government drug running, torture, and covert operations among others. While Ventura imparts little thought-provoking nuggets of wisdom to set off each document, such as his question on the CIA: \u201cSo who runs this agency if the president doesn\u2019t?\u201d (a question I still can\u2019t find the answer to), these reproduced government pieces speak largely for themselves and will shock even seasoned conspiracy theorists\u2026 They simply have to be read to be believed.\n\nAnd speaking of the CIA\u2026\n\n2. The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence\n\nTo put it bluntly, the Central Intelligence Agency did not want this book to come out. Period.\n\nThis book was written by former CIA employee Victor L. Marchetti and former State Department intelligence analyst John D. Marks. In 1972, another CIA employee identifying himself as Robert P. B. Lohmann filed an affidavit in a federal court asking for an injunction against the book\u2019s release.\n\nIt seems Marchetti never gave an advanced copy over to the agency for review before publishing\u2026 which begs the question, how exactly did Lohmann end up with a copy to file the court papers over to begin with? Marchetti circulated maybe half a dozen copies in total and none were to Lohmann or his former employer\u2026\n\nThis is the first book that the federal government ever went to court to try and censor before publication.\n\nThat should tell you enough right there, but here\u2019s a little more. Marchetti referred to the \u201ccult of intelligence\u201d as a way of identifying the counterproductive CIA culture obsessed with \u201csecrecy, elitism, and lawlessness,\u201d and ultimately, a \u201csecret fraternity of the American political aristocracy.\u201d\n\nThe injunction was granted and after the agency fully reviewed the book, it designated some 339 portions to be deleted. That number was later bargained down to 168 after the authors filed their own lawsuit to challenge the government\u2019s censorship. The 1974 copy includes 168 blank spaces where those portions used to be.\n\nGuess we\u2019re left to fill in the blanks\u2026\n\n(For more in this vein, see also David Wise\u2019s The American Police State: The Government against the People)\n\n3. Tragedy & Hope: A History of the World in Our Time\n\nHistorian and author Carroll Quigley originally wrote this 1,300-page tome for a very limited audience, but instead found infamy in the conspiratorial camps opposed to world government and the Western establishment.\n\nIt doubles as an authoritative historical account of the 20th century and a revelation of many of the machinations of the hidden hand. Quigley, known for being a Bill Clinton mentor while at Georgetown, claims he was given access to the records of the Milner Group, a secret society sister organization to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Royal Institute of International Affairs.\n\nIn it, Quigley unveils for the first time the admitted workings of the Anglo-American Establishment who have manipulated all manner of world affairs from banking, to nation-building, to wars and military affairs, to grand political schemes for world government through the steering group of the Cecil Rhodes secret society.\n\nWhile you may not finish it in one sitting, it is an authoritative history lesson in the architecture of conspiracy. Just ask the John Birch Society (JBS) who played a big role in bringing this book out of the shadows and before the public.\n\nAfter publicizing much of the book\u2019s information about the plot for world government, Quigley\u2019s allies and backers tried to have the book removed from circulation entirely. However, the JBS secured the plates for printing and obtained permission to put it back in the public\u2019s hands, making sure it would continue to be widely available.\n\n(Also, don\u2019t miss Quigley\u2019s shorter companion piece The Anglo-American Establishment, which details the little-known but hugely significant operations in history of the Round Table groups who have changed world order forever.)\n\n4. The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World\n\nL. Fletcher Prouty who served as Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Kennedy years is best known for blowing the whistle on the CIA\u2019s role in the JFK assassination plot and inspiring the \u201cMr. X\u201d character in the Oliver Stone movie. In these pages, Prouty provides some important background history on the undoing of the United States of America.\n\nFrom his insider position, Prouty shows how former CIA head Allen W. Dulles and his allies lobbied for the National Security Act and the creation of the CIA itself, then transformed the agency from a restrained intelligence-gathering operation into an unleashed, unaccountable paragovernment entity that carried out countless coups, assassinations, and black ops both foreign and domestic.\n\nAfter reading how Dulles mutated the CIA to enable his own decade-long reign of power in pursuit of the establishment\u2019s secret agenda, you will not only understand why President Kennedy fired Dulles, but why America can never again be a Constitutional Republic until these shadow powers are absolved and the CIA is stopped. The government definitely does not want this information becoming common knowledge among its citizenry.\n\n5. Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare\n\nOnce you\u2019ve fallen this far down the rabbit hole, in a dark place where the signs of secret domination are everywhere, you\u2019ll eventually wind up at this book.\n\nFormer Associated Press reporter-turned-independent historian Michael Hoffman decodes the nexus between occult symbolism and numerous false flags, highly publicized events, and pop culture icons to reveal the secret signs of the Cryptocracy.\n\nBehind events both historical and modern are the often overlooked calling cards of secret society operations that not only point to their hand in manipulation, but a deeper symbolic meaning that flies over the heads of the population at large.\n\nFrom the Masons to Ancient Egypt, from secret Kabbalah sects to Skull & Bone and yes, the Illuminati, in addition to any number of other shadowy groups today, the use of mass mind control and cult ritual magic on and against the rest of us is put together masterfully.\n\nUltimately, it is the doctrine of \u201cRevelation of the Method\u201d used by the elite to socially engineer the population to its bidding and steer the world to a new age of global domination.\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://www.soulask.com/5-books-the-secret-government-hopes-youll-never-read/\n\nStories Contributed by N.

What will the package label says.\n\nCompanies seeking to commercialize seafood products made from the cells of fish or shellfish should use the term \u201ccell-based\u201d on product labels, according to a Rutgers study \u2013 the first of its kind \u2013 in the Journal of Food Science.\n\nA meal featuring white fish, which someday may be made from the cells of fish.\n\nPhoto: William Hallman/Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick\n\nBoth the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture require food products to have a \u201ccommon or usual name\u201d on their labels so consumers can make informed choices about what they\u2019re purchasing.\n\nThe study by William Hallman, a professor who chairs the Department of Human Ecology in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences at Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick, is the first to evaluate what name should be used on labels for seafood products to best meet both regulatory and consumer acceptance criteria.\n\n\u201cThe results suggest that \u2018cell-based\u2019 is the best name when it comes to meeting both FDA regulations and likely consumer acceptance of these novel products,\u201d Hallman said. \u201cThe participants were able to tell that \u2018cell-based seafood\u2019 products were different from \u2018wild caught\u2019 and \u2018farm raised\u2019 products, but viewed them as equally nutritious and were just as interested in tasting and purchasing them.\u201d\n\nDemand for seafood continues to increase, but the global supply is vulnerable and cannot keep pace. By producing just the parts of fish that people eat rather than catching or raising them whole, cell-based seafood products are expected to offer a healthy, sustainable alternative that will look, cook and taste the same as conventional seafood. They will also have the same nutritional qualities and health benefits as farmed and wild caught seafood, but will be free of mercury, microplastics and other environmental contaminants.\n\nIn the Rutgers study, 3,186 consumers were asked to evaluate one of seven potential names as well as \u201cwild caught\u201d and \u201cfarm raised,\u201d shown on images of realistic packages of salmon, tuna or shrimp. The names tested were: \u201ccell-based seafood,\u201d \u201ccell-cultured seafood,\u201d \u201ccultivated seafood,\u201d \u201ccultured seafood,\u201d and the phrases, \u201cproduced using cellular aquaculture,\u201d \u201ccultivated from the cells of ____\u201d and \u201cgrown directly from the cells of ____.\u201d\n\nUnder FDA regulations, a common or usual name must clearly distinguish a new product type from those with which consumers are already familiar. For cell-based seafood, this means choosing a name that signals to consumers that the product is different from wild caught and farm raised seafood. Because the products will also have the same proteins as conventional fish and shellfish, the name chosen also needs to signal that people allergic to seafood shouldn\u2019t eat the product.\n\nThe study also stipulated that the name be seen by consumers as an appropriate term to identify the product and that it not disparage either cell-based or conventional products, which excluded testing terms such as \u201clab-grown,\u201d \u201csynthetic,\u201d \u201cslaughter-free\u201d and \u201ccruelty-free.\u201d\n\nThe study found that terms with the word \u201ccell\u201d in them, including \u201ccell-based\u201d and \u201ccell-cultured,\u201d worked best in helping consumers understand that the products are neither farm raised nor wild caught.\n\nThe names \u201ccell-based\u201d and \u201ccell-cultured\u201d were not significantly different on most key measures, making \u201ccell-cultured\u201d also a potentially viable name. Consumers viewed both as appropriate to identify the product and they did equally well at signaling that people allergic to seafood shouldn\u2019t eat the products.\n\nHowever, products labeled \u201ccell-based\u201d were seen by participants as equally desirable as \u201cwild caught\u201d and \u201cfarm raised\u201d seafood products, while those labeled \u201ccell-cultured\u201d were not, suggesting that \u201ccell-based seafood\u201d is the better common or usual name to appear on products.\n\nThe study was supported by BlueNalu, a San Diego company led by Lou Cooperhouse, former director of Rutgers Food Innovation Center.

The first historically attested wave of what later became known as the Black Plague (caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis) spread throughout the Byzantine Empire and beyond, in 541 CE. Known as Justinianic Plague, after the emperor Justinian who contracted the disease but survived, it caused high mortality and had a range of socio-economic effects.\n\nSt Sebastian pleading for the life of a gravedigger afflicted with plague during the 7th-century Plague of Justinian.\n\nCredit: Josse Lieferinxe / Wikimedia Commons\n\nAround the same time, an enormous volcanic eruption in late 535 or early 536 CE marked the beginning of the coldest decade in the last two thousand years (another volcano of similar proportions erupted in 539 CE). However, scholars disagree as to just how far-reaching and devastating the mid-6th century epidemic and climate change were. This scholarly debate is unsurprising considering that even today, leaders and policymakers around the world differ on the severity and correct response to COVID-19, not to mention climate change. One reason that hindsight is not 20/20 when it comes to ancient plagues is that ancient reports tend to exaggerate, or underrepresent, the human tolls, while archaeological evidence for the social and economic effects of plague are very hard to find. Recently, a team of Israeli archaeologists discovered new and compelling evidence for a significant economic downturn on the fringe of the Byzantine Empire in the aftermath of a major pandemic in the mid-6th century CE. The research, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), reconstructs the rise and fall of commercial viticulture in the middle of Israel\u2019s arid Negev desert. Daniel Fuks, a PhD student in the Martin (Szusz) Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology at Bar-Ilan University, led the study as a researcher in Prof. Ehud Weiss\u2019 Archaeobotany Lab, and as a team member of the Negev Byzantine Bio-Archaeology Research Program, \u201cCrisis on the Margins of the Byzantine Empire\u201d, headed by Prof. Guy Bar-Oz of the University of Haifa. This project seeks to discover when and why the agricultural settlement of the Negev Highlands was abandoned.\n\nVine seeds discovered in the area\n\nCredit: Bar-Ilan University Agriculture in this arid desert was made possible through rainwater runoff farming which reached its peak in the Byzantine period, as seen at sites like Elusa, Shivta and Nessana. At Negev Highland sites today, the ruins of well-built stone structures attest to their former glory, but Bar-Oz\u2019s team, guided by field archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), Dr. Yotam Tepper and Dr. Tali Erickson-Gini, discovered even more compelling evidence about life during that period in an unexpected place: the trash. \u201cYour trash says a lot about you. In the ancient trash mounds of the Negev, there is a record of residents\u2019 daily lives \u2013 in the form of plant remains, animal remains, ceramic sherds, and more,\u201d explains Bar-Oz. \u201cIn the \u2018Crisis on the Margins\u2019 project, we excavated these mounds to uncover the human activity behind the trash, what it included, when it flourished, and when it declined.\u201d The study of seeds found in archaeological excavations is part of the field known as archaeobotany (aka paleoethnobotany). The Bar-Ilan University Archaebotany Lab in which most of this research was conducted is the only lab in Israel dedicated to the identification of ancient seeds and fruits. Prof. Ehud Weiss, the lab\u2019s head, explains that the task of archaeobotany is to \u201cget into the pantry \u2013 or, in this case, the trash \u2013 of ancient people and study their interactions with plants.\n\nArchaeobotany reconstructs ancient economy, environment and culture, but the way there is not easy. Grain by grain must be sorted through endless sediment samples, looking for seeds, identifying them and counting each one, as it is written \u2018\u2026if one can count the dust of the earth, then your seed too can be counted\u2019 (Genesis 13:16).\u201d For the present study, nearly 10,000 seeds of grape, wheat and barley were retrieved and counted from 11 trash mounds at three sites. \u201cIdentifying seed and fruit remains is a unique capability of our lab,\u201d says Weiss, \u201cand it relies on the Israel National Reference Collection of Plant Seeds and Fruit held in our lab, and on years of experience in retrieving, processing, and analyzing plant remains from sites of all periods in Israeli archaeology.\u201d One of the researchers\u2019 first observations was the high numbers of grape seeds in the ancient trash mounds. This fit well with previous scholars\u2019 suggestions that the Negev was involved in export-bound viticulture. Byzantine texts laud the vinum Gazetum or \u201cGaza wine\u201d as a sweet white wine exported from the port of Gaza throughout the Mediterranean and beyond. This wine was generally transported in a type of amphora known as \u201cGaza Jars\u201d or \u201cGaza Wine Jars\u201d, which are also found in sites throughout the Mediterranean. In Byzantine Negev trash mounds, these Gaza Jars appear in high quantities.\n\nRoman-era Palestinian amphorae, Bodrum Castle, Turkey\n\nOwn work / Wikimedia Commons Credit: Ad Meskens Daniel Fuks, the Bar-Ilan University PhD student, sought to determine whether there were any interesting trends in the relative frequency of grape pips in the rubbish. In a Ted-style talk hosted by Bet Avichai last year, he said, \u201cImagine you\u2019re an ancient farmer with a plot of land to feed your family. On most of it, you plant cereals like wheat and barley because that\u2019s how you get your bread. On a smaller part, you plant a vineyard and other crops like legumes, vegetables and fruit trees, for your family\u2019s needs. \u201cBut one day you realize that you could sell the excellent wine you produce, for export, and earn enough cash to buy bread and a bit more. Little by little you expand your vineyard and move from subsistence farming to commercial viticulture. \u201cIf we look at your trash and count the seeds, we\u2019ll discover a rise in the proportion of grape pips relative to cereal grains. And that\u2019s exactly what we discovered: A significant rise in the ratio of grape pips to cereal grains between the 4th century CE and the mid-6th century. Then suddenly, it declines.\u201d Meanwhile, Fuks and Dr. Tali Erickson-Gini, an expert in ancient Negev pottery, took this to the next level. They checked whether there were similar trends in the proportion of Gaza Wine Jars to Bag-Shaped Jars, the latter being much less suited to camelback transport from the Negev Highlands to the port at Gaza. Indeed, the rise and initial decline of Gaza Jars tracked the rise and fall of the grape pips. The researchers concluded that the commercial scale of viticulture in the Negev, as seen in the grape pip ratios, was connected to Mediterranean trade, attested to by the Gaza Jar ratios. In other words, a novel archaeological testimony to an international commercial economy from some 1,500 years ago was discovered!\n\nView of the Negev Highlands from the ancient Nabataean city of Avdat\n\n\n\nCredit: Andrew Shiva / Wikipedia Credit: Andrew Shiva / Wikipedia", "link": "https://beforeitsnews.com/health/2020/07/ancient-economy-in-the-grip-of-plague-and-climate-change-collapsed-lessons-from-grape-pips-3033943.html", "author": ["Alton Parrish"]}, {"title": "Tom Horn Dies & God Shows Him the Future & End Times Vatican & Wormwood Prophecies", "text": "% of readers think this story is Fact.

The relative quietness allowed researchers to listen in to previously concealed earthquake signals, and could help us differentiate between human and natural seismic noise more clearly than ever before. Co-author Dr Stephen Hicks, from Imperial\u2019s Department of Earth Science and Engineering, said: \u201cThis quiet period is the longest and largest dampening of human-caused seismic noise since we started monitoring the Earth in detail using vast monitoring networks of seismometers. \u201cOur study uniquely highlights just how much human activities impact the solid Earth, and could let us see more clearly than ever what differentiates human and natural noise.\u201d The paper is published today in Science.\n\nAnthropause Measured by instruments called seismometers, seismic noise is caused by vibrations within the Earth, which travel like waves. The waves can be triggered by earthquakes, volcanoes, and bombs \u2013 but also by daily human activity like travel and industry. via GIPHY via GIPHY Lecocq et al. Although 2020 has not seen a reduction in earthquakes, the drop in human-caused seismic noise is unprecedented. The strongest drops were found in urban areas, but the study also found signatures of the lockdown on sensors buried hundreds of metres underground and in more remote areas. Human-generated noise usually dampens during quiet periods like over the Christmas/New Year period and Chinese New Year, and during weekends and overnight. However, the drop in vibrations caused by COVID-19 lockdown measures eclipse even those seen during these periods.\n\nDrop in UK seismic activity and recreation/retail activity, pre- and post-lockdown\n\n\n\nCredit: Imperial College London, Lecocq et al. Credit: Imperial College London, Lecocq et al.\n\nSome researchers are dubbing this drop in anthropogenic (human-caused) noise and pollution the \u2018anthropause\u2019. Dr Hicks said: \u201cThis is the first global study of the impact of the coronavirus anthropause on the solid Earth beneath our feet.\u201d To gather the data, researchers looked at seismic data from a global network of 268 seismic stations in 117 countries and found significant noise reductions compared to before any lockdown at 185 of those stations. Beginning in China in late January 2020, and followed by Europe and the rest of the world in March to April 2020, researchers tracked the \u2018wave\u2019 of quietening between March and May as worldwide lockdown measures took hold.\n\nWith increasing urbanisation and growing global populations, more people will be living in geologically hazardous areas. It will therefore become more important than ever to differentiate between natural and human-caused noiseDr Thomas LecocqRoyal Observatory of Belgium The largest drops in vibrations were seen in the most densely populated areas, like Singapore and New York City, but drops were also seen in remote areas like Germany\u2019s Black Forest and Rundu in Namibia. Citizen-owned seismometers, which tend to measure more localised noise, noted large drops around universities and schools around Cornwall, UK and Boston, USA \u2013 a drop in noise 20 per cent larger than seen during school holidays. Countries like Barbados, where lockdown coincided with the tourist season, saw a 50 per cent decrease in noise. This coincided with flight data that suggested tourists returned home in the weeks before official lockdown.\n\nListening in Over the past few decades, seismic noise has gradually increased as economies and populations have grown. The drastic changes to daily life caused by the pandemic have provided a unique opportunity to study their environmental impacts, such as reductions in emissions and pollution in the atmosphere. The changes have also given us the opportunity to listen in to the Earth\u2019s natural vibrations without the distortions of human input.\n\nCtizen seismometer known as a \u2018Raspberry Shake\u2019\n\nPhoto of seismometer: Stephen Hicks/Imperial College London Photo of seismometer: Stephen Hicks/Imperial College London\n\nThe study reports the first evidence that previously concealed earthquake signals, especially during daytime, appeared much clearer on seismometers in urban areas during lockdown. The researchers say the lockdown quietening could also help them differentiate between human-caused noise and natural signals that might warn of upcoming natural disasters. Lead author Dr Thomas Lecocq from the Royal Observatory of Belgium said: \u201cWith increasing urbanisation and growing global populations, more people will be living in geologically hazardous areas. It will therefore become more important than ever to differentiate between natural and human-caused noise so that we can \u2018listen in\u2019 and better monitor the ground movements beneath our feet. This study could help to kick-start this new field of study.\u201d The study\u2019s authors hope that their work will spawn further research on the seismic lockdown, as well as finding previously hidden signals from earthquakes and volcanoes. Dr Hicks said: \u201cThe lockdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic may have given us a glimmer of insight into how human and natural noise interacts with the Earth. We hope this insight will spawn new studies that help us listen better to the Earth and understand natural signals we would otherwise have missed.\u201d\n\n268 seismometers (red) in 117 countries detected a drop on seismic noise.\n\nCredits: Lecocq et al.

I am watching in real time people I know and respect be slandered, demonized and ruined. Their websites taken down, videos taken down. The Frontline Doctors (they are another version of Doctors Without Borders, they go around the world providing medical care to poor countries) who gave the press conference two days ago in front of the Supreme Court had their website taken down. And the videos of the presser taken down from all social media platforms.\n\nThis morning Dr. Simone Gold, one of the founders of Frontline Doctors, said she put up another website where she gave links to studies and information, \u201cAmericasFrontlineDoctorsSummit.com\u201d. I went there this morning and it has ALREADY been taken down. Check it out yourself.\n\nI went to my archives where I keep links to studies, articles, videos, etc. that provide evidence of the issues I write about. I found dozens of links that say, \u201cthis content is no longer available\u201d.\n\nI then went to the internet and looked up the Frontline Doctors and they are all being slandered. Mostly Dr. Stella Immanuel, a Black Nigerian Woman. Yes, she is passionate and yes, she has some strange beliefs, but she is a good doctor and nothing she said was incorrect. She mostly treats diabetics and hasn\u2019t lost a single one to COVID. None of these critics have proven any of these doctors wrong, they are just slandering them because they don\u2019t like their message.\n\nOne of these Frontline doctors, Dr. Bob Hamilton is a highly respected Los Angeles pediatrician. He was Chief Resident of Pediatrics at UCLA. He has had a 26 year practice in Santa Monica. He is called the \u201cbaby whisperer\u201d. I know Dr. Bob well. He is one of the most ethical, kindest, most generous men I know. Seeing his ethics questioned infuriates me. Tell me when the media or politicians have EVER done this to doctors before. Tell me when Governors have denied doctors the use of an FDA approved medication. I had saved videos of doctors saying they were being threatened with having their licenses revoked if they prescribed HCQ or after prescribing it having their patient tell them the pharmacy wouldn\u2019t fill it? Those videos are \u201cno longer available\u201d. Why? When has this ever happened before?\n\nAnd when did social media become medical experts? I asked @jack today to provide the scientific evidence that the Frontline doctors were wrong. I\u2019m not expecting an answer but the question needs asking. So, why all this fury over a safe, and in many countries, over the counter medication? A medication that for 65 years has been approved by the FDA for use for pregnant women, breast feeding women and children? A medication safer than aspirin?\n\nFirst let me say it\u2019s called the \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d for a reason. Each of us has our own unique DNA. We have different vulnerabilities, different lifestyles, different exposures to toxins. Some of us exercise, some don\u2019t, some eat well, some don\u2019t, some smoke, drink, do drugs, some don\u2019t. We are different and therefore a treatment that works for one person might not work at all for another. That is why a medication that works for most, may not work for some. Every drug, no matter how safe, has a certain percentage of people who have an adverse reaction to it. It is up to doctors to weigh the possible adverse reactions with the benefits. This is true of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as with all medications. And we know with 65 years of use that HCQ\u2019s benefits far outweigh any adverse reactions. It is used in 3rd world countries to prevent malaria. It is over the counter in these countries. It isn\u2019t over the counter in America because there is no demand for it. We don\u2019t have malaria here. But it is used broadly for Lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nUntil today I believed the media and politicians demonization of HCQ was because of the \u201cOrange Man Bad\u201d opposition to anything Trump praises. I have done a lot of research today that makes me believe this is a much bigger plan.\n\nIn January when we were just becoming aware of COVID-19 France took HCQ off the \u201cover the counter\u201d status and put it on \u201cpoisonous substances\u201d status. Why? They know it\u2019s safe. They also know it is an effective prophylactic for many viruses. So why would France restrict a medication that could possibly prevent this virus?\n\nThere have been many studies of HCQ\u2019s effect on COVID viruses. Understand COVID viruses are not new. There are many versions of COVID just as there are many versions of the regular flu. That is why it\u2019s called COVID-19. SARS is a COVID virus.\n\nDr. Fauci\u2019s National Institutes of Health (NIH) did several studies that showed HCQ was effective in treating and preventing SARS (COVID-2). The following are links to some of them:\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32205204/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32205204/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32251731/\n\nThe NIH also did a study that found asymptomatic SARS carriers were not infecting others. This is very likely the same with COVID-19 as both are COVID viruses.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32513410/\n\nFauci knows HCQ is effective. Why would he not recommend the use of a medication he knows is safe? Ask yourself even if it weren\u2019t effective what is the harm in trying a medication that is safe enough for pregnant or nursing women and children?\n\nSo, I wanted to know how countries that used HCQ on a regular basis, who use it to prevent malaria and where it is over the counter, fared against countries that didn\u2019t. Let\u2019s look at the most obvious first, Africa.\n\nCOUNTRY POPULATION COVID DEATHS\n\nEGYPT 91.5M 4,728\n\nALGERIA 43M 1,186\n\nSUDAN 43M 725\n\nCHAD 16M 75\n\nNIGERIA 201M 873\n\nCONGO 86M 210\n\nSOMALIA 15M 93\n\nCompare the deaths to those in Western Civilization Countries below:\n\nAMERICA 330M 150,000\n\nENGLAND 55M 41,360\n\nFRANCE 67M 30,238\n\nGERMANY 83M 9,214\n\nITALY 60M 35,132\n\nAnd then to the countries that DIDN\u2019T lock down, social distance or close schools:\n\nINDIA 1.3BILLION 35,716\n\nTURKEY 83M 5,659\n\nSWEDEN 10M 5,739\n\nNORWAY 5M 255\n\nFINLAND 5M 329\n\nIndia, Turkey, and Africa gave a large portion of their population HCQ or a large portion was already taking it regularly. Note the Congo. With a population of 86 million and not exactly the most hygienic environment, they had 210 deaths. LOOK at the number of deaths in Africa where HCQ is used regularly for malaria and compare it to America with all our mask wearing, social distancing, lock downs and quarantines. In our clean environment we have 150,000 deaths. Even if you question the accuracy of that number (see below) it is still too large number compared to the countries that used HCQ or just didn\u2019t lock down.\n\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/499085-cdc-acknowledges-mixing-up-coronavirus-testing-data\n\nhttps://www.wbir.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/state-confirms-300-people-incorrectly-traced-as-testing-positive-for-covid-19/51-72a8d120-c6e0-42d0-aa70-ce3151a582bf\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/medical/concerns-arise-as-some-receive-positive-covid-19-results-but-never-got-tested/ar-BB16Wkwg?fbclid=IwAR0K2v9Ig6yWVLbJ6oHRJBKazoztuUfB-0JhLC5P5LjFvgG8W7ipVxmWevE\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/\n\nLet\u2019s put things into perspective. Every year there are about 650,000 deaths world wide from the regular flu. To date, COVID has resulted in 668,801 deaths world wide. The CDC reported the death rate for COVID-19 is 0.26% which means there is a 99.8% survival rate.\n\nhttps://www.theepochtimes.com/hydroxychloroquine-lowers-covid-19-death-rate-us-study-finds_3410208.html\n\nWe are told to believe the science. I do and I don\u2019t think a virus with a 99.8% survival rate warrants us destroying our economy, destroying millions of small businesses, denying us weddings, funerals, graduations or any of the holiday celebrations. Denying us social interaction. Denying us the ability to comfort sick or dying loved ones. Denying us the ability to work or keep our businesses open.\n\nWe don\u2019t wear masks, social distance or lock down our economy for the flu or any other infectious disease. Why are we doing it for this one? And why are we being denied a life saving medication, a medication that can prevent the virus as well as treat it?\n\nHave you heard the media report on the low numbers of deaths in 3rd world countries that use HCQ? Have you heard a discussion of why the countries or states that DIDN\u2019T lock down have no more deaths than the ones that did? Have you heard a discussion in the media about why protests with thousands in the streets are OK but Church services are not?\n\nThe only medication the media considers promising is REMDESIVIR. Interestingly, Remdesivir costs $3000 per treatment while HCQ costs $10. From what I\u2019ve been able to learn about Remdesivir, some studies look promising but it isn\u2019t ready for prime time. HCQ is and it\u2019s cheap.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about our children, the virus and opening schools. This is the subject Dr. Bob Hamilton spoke about in the press conference. One of the networks hand selected six pediatricians on to discuss school opening. They didn\u2019t expect all six of them to say they would send their own child without reservation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends opening schools. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/coronavirus-schools-reopening-guidelines-aap.html\n\nAs I said, I DO believe the science. Those opposing opening schools don\u2019t. World wide, from countries and states that didn\u2019t close schools there has not been ONE case found where an adult contracted the virus from a child. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/29/no-case-child-passing-coronavirus-adult-exists-evidence-review/\n\nThe SCIENCE is that children are not COVID spreaders.\n\nhttps://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11646897/primary-school-kids-not-coronavirus-super-spreaders-major-study/\n\nMore damage will be done to our children by being denied going to school in person than the virus could ever do. Our children are being sacrificed to the Left\u2019s agenda. So are small business owners, so are we all.\n\nYou know this isn\u2019t about protecting people from a deadly virus when the Teachers Union says they won\u2019t allow schools to open unless all Charter schools, private schools and home schooling is ended. Until there is Medicare for all, defunding police, increased property taxes, welfare for illegal aliens, housing security, etc. None of that has anything to do with COVID. They are holding our children hostage for their Marxist wishes.\n\nFor decades the Left has been working to take control of everything people do. What better way than COVID-19. I suspected once the Left locked us down they wouldn\u2019t allow us to open up again. When we started opening up a month or so ago, our economy started to boom again. We had the highest jobs report ever in this country. The Left couldn\u2019t have that happen. So now we get the number of positive cases daily instead of the number of deaths. The deaths are going down but the cases increasing due to the amount of testing we are doing. We have no idea if COVID-19 is more infectious or not because we have NEVER tested healthy people before. We have no idea how many people have had other infectious diseases but were asymptomatic. What is NOT reported is how many are asymptomatic or have recovered. What is NOT reported is the 99.8% survival rate. What is NOT reports is that the states and countries that DIDN\u2019T lock down have no more deaths per capita than those that did.\n\nThe states with the most severe restrictions are Democrat run states and cities. Los Angeles Mayor Garcetti said they may not open up until there is a cure\u2026\u2026that could be never. Some say until there is a vaccine\u2026.that could also be never. We have no vaccine for the regular flu.\n\nDemocrat Mayors and Governors are choosing winners and losers. Pot Stores, Liquor stores are open, restaurants not. Protests and riots are fine, Churches not. Gyms, hairdressers, nail salons, malls, department stores, closed, Home Depot, Walmart, not.\n\nPlanned Parenthood abortions are approved but not other elective operations that may include cancer biopsies, cardiac operations, and other lifesaving operations.\n\nWe are being lied to daily. We are told not to believe what we can see with our own eyes. We are told rioting, looting. and burning buildings are \u201cpeaceful protests\u201d. We are told the \u201cprotests\u201d aren\u2019t responsible for higher COVID cases. We are told to believe the science when what the media tells us is contrary to the actual science.\n\nI have become increasingly suspicious that none of this is an accident. We know BLM and ANTIFA are being generously funded by groups that want to \u201cfundamentally transform\u201d this country. But how advantageous has it been for the globalist that COVID-19 happened when America\u2019s economy had never been better. When our unemployment was never lower. When a President standing in the way of the globalists was assured re-election.\n\nI am going to post the following links and let you make up your own mind (wouldn\u2019t it be nice if the media would do the same?).

(Jeremiah 50:23 KJV) \u201cBehold, a people is coming from the north, And a great nation and many kings will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth. (Jeremiah 50:41)\n\nThe God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob considers America and Britain modern day Babylon, and will surely destroy America and Britain as He has sworn to do (Jeremiah 51). So what countries will destroy America and Britain? Jeremiah 51:57 tells us that our enemies are Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz. Find out which countries they represent today.\n\nI am using the Key of David which is Holy Gematria to unlock the Prophecy in Revelation to my Christian Brethern. The Holy Spirit led me to Holy Gematria to unlock the prophecy in Revelation and the rest of the Holy Scriptures in the Holy Bible.\n\nThe key of David appears only twice in the Bible. The first time it appears is in Revelation where it states, \u201cTo the angel of the church in Philadelphia write . . . who holds the KEY OF DAVID\u201d (Revelation 3:7). The speaker is the resurrected Jesus, whom John sees in a vision, and the message is to the church at Philadelphia. The possession of this key by Christ is used as proof that the Being addressing the church is God, \u201cthe Holy One, the One Who is true.\u201d\n\nThe second occurence of the key of David is in the book of Isaiah the prophet where it states, \u201cAnd the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder (Eliakim a servant of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob); so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open\u201d (Isaiah 22:22, KJV).\n\nKey of David\n\n= 1189 or 10+10+8+9 = 37 or 3+7 = 10\n\n= 612 or 12+6 = 18 or 8-1 = 7\n\n= 102 or 20+1 = 21 or 7\n\nAuthority to unveil prophecy through Holy Gematria\n\n= 3902 or 39-2 = 37 or 3+7 = 10\n\n= 3552 or 35+5+2 = 42 or 7\n\n= 592 or 5+9+2 = 16 or 1+6 = 7\n\nThe two number 10\u2019s above signifies that I received my authority from Jesus Our Messiah.\n\nMy purpose in informing you of this background is to make you aware that I am certainly capable of sifting all of the disinformation out there that we are constantly being bombarded with daily through the media. America, the once wealthiest democracy in the world, is Babylon, and will be destroyed. America has now been reduced to a bankrupt hodgepodge of fascist banana republic states led by a host of tin pot dictators, including the President, Vice-President and Speaker of the House or Nancy Antoinette, the \u201cLet Them Eat Ice Cream\u201d harlot!\n\nPesher Code and Holy Gematria\n\nThe veiled words that were used in the Books of the New Testament were hidden within both a Pesher (a word cypher) and Holy Gematria (a number cypher) based on the numerical values of the Hebrew alphabet and were lost to us over time. Luke 8:17 states \u201cFor nothing is hidden that shall not become evident, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light\u201d.\n\nPut six theologians in a room and ask them to identify the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse of chapter six of Revelation and you will get a variety of explanations. How should this be, as 1 Corinthians 14:16 tells us God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is NOT an Elohim of confusion!\n\nIt took many years of effort by another Luke, namely myself, along with my helper the Holy Spirit to finally bring these veiled prophecies to light. I managed to achieve the results of being able to decipher the Pesher and Holy Gematria the Essene scribes used to write the Dead Sea Scrolls and the New Testament for five reasons. I am a retired mathematician and had the time, dedication and health to achieve the results. I also prayed constantly to achieve a double portion of wisdom and knowledge from God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and was eventually rewarded. I received a double portion of the Holy Spirit as my constant guide and helper, which enabled me to decipher the prophecies in the major books of the Holy Scriptures.\n\nGod of Abraham Isaac and Jacob has given me the wisdom and understanding through His Holy Spirit to determine who has crept in among us, and the ability through the use of Holy Gematria to identify them (Jude 1:4).\n\nIn 2 Corinthians 13:1, it states every fact is to be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses. In other words every fact given to us by the written word of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob can be confirmed as truth, as God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob cannot lie (Hebrews 6:18) by the matching of two or three Holy Gematria numbers.\n\nin order that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have strong encouragement, we who have fled for refuge in laying hold of the hope set before us. (Hebrews 6:18)\n\nThe use of Holy Gematria is also confirmed in 2 Tim. 2:15 KJV.\n\nStudy to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. (2 Tim. 2:15 KJV)\n\nrightly dividing the word of truth\n\n= 3097 or 97+30 = 127 or 27-1 = 26 or 2+6 = 8\n\n= 2268 or 2+2+6+8 = 18 or 9\n\n= 378 or 3+7+8 = 18 or 8\n\nUse Gematria to determine the truth\n\n= 1557 or 57+15 = 72 or 8\n\n= 2202 or 22-2 = 20 or 10 or 10-1 = 9\n\n= 367 or 3+6+7 = 16 or 8\n\nNumbers are not subject to interpretation like words (2+2 always equate to 4). God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is the ultimate mathematician as everything was created through numbers. King David used Holy Gematria to communicate with God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob through an Ephod (1 Samuel 30:7-8). The Ephod that King David used was an Abacus with Holy Gematria.\n\nIt took me many years to determine what type, as there are many types of Gematria, that King David and Jesus and the Essenes used. I then had to determine the rules of how to use Holy Gematria as the rules had been lost to us. Once I had all of this information in place, it allowed me to determine who the enemies of humanity are today. My discovery, which no one seems to pay much attention to as yet, has answered all questions regarding God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s intentions for all of humankind in these last days in my series of articles posted here at Before Its News.\n\n\u201cFor nothing is hidden that shall not become evident, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light. (Luke 8:17) Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\u201d (John 8:32) Perhaps the most famous verse about truth in the Bible is what Jesus said \u201c\u2026 I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\u201d (John 14:6) Declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, \u2018My purpose will be established, And I will accomplish all My good pleasure\u2019; (Isaiah 46:10)\n\nI am using the Gematria calculator on gematrix.org for all my calculations to allow my readers to follow along if they wish to do so and am using the NASB77 bible for all bible verses unless otherwise noted. I am comparing the bible verse or phase to the underlying meaning of the verse using the three witnesses of Holy Gematria with my helper, the Holy Spirit.\n\nLine On Line Refers To When We Are On Line On Our Computers\n\nIsaiah 28:10 states: line on line. Online means Revelation would only be deciphered with the development of the computer and Internet. Line on line means you compare one line of words of any Bible verse converted to Holy Gematria numbers with another line of what you believe the interpretation of the Bible verse actually is and then convert those words to Holy Gematria numbers. If you obtain a match, your interpretation is correct, as God cannot lie (Numbers 23:10). \u201cA little here a little there\u201d (Isaiah 28:10) means that you may have a Bible chapter that you might think is dealing with only one subject when it is actually dealing with two or more separate subjects.\n\nIn both Deut.17:6 and Deut.19:15, it states that a matter shall be confirmed on the evidence of two or three witnesses. The duality to this statement also means two or three matches in Holy Gematria and I have used three Holy Gematria types throughout my work on prophecy, namely Hebrew, English and Simple Holy Gematria to confirm the truth.\n\nI am using the gematria calculator at gematrix.org for all my calculations so you can follow along. I reduce the gematria numbers to a single digit either by adding or subtracting or taking a factor. An aleph (1) or a zero are neutral numbers and can be dropped. We can add or subtract an aleph (1) to any final number and an additional aleph (1) to any number where there is an aleph in the number. I am using the NASB77 Bible unless otherwise noted.\n\nTwo Or Three Witnesses\n\nThis is the third time I am coming to you. EVERY FACT IS TO BE CONFIRMED BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES. (2 Corinthians 13:1)\n\nEvery fact is to be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses\n\n= 5885 or 85+58 = 143 or 43+1 = 44 or 4+4 = 8 (Jewish Gematria)\n\n= 4578 or 78+45 = 123 1+2+3 = 6 (English Gematria)\n\n= 763 or 63+7 = 70 or 7 or 7+1 = 8 (Simple Gematria)\n\nEvery fact is to be confirmed by the testimony of two or three numbers in Gematria\n\n= 5075 or 75+5 = 80 or 8 (Jewish Gematria)\n\n= 4776 or 76+47 = 123 or 23+1 = 24 or 6 (English Gematria)\n\n= 796 or 96-7 = 89 or 8+9 = 17 or 1+7 = 8 (Simple Gematria)\n\nInvasion of America from the North\n\n\u201cBehold, a people is coming from the north, And a great nation and many kings will be aroused from the remote parts of the earth. (Jeremiah 50:41)\n\na people is coming from the north\n\n= 996 or 9+9+6 = 24 or 6\n\n= 1914 or 14+19 = 33 or 3+3 = 6\n\n= 319 or 31+9 = 40 or 8\n\nUnited Nations troops come from Canada\n\n= 1422 or 22+14 = 36 or 6\n\n= 2280 or 80+22 = 102 or 10+2 = 12 or 6\n\n= 380 or 3+8+0 = 11 or 8\n\nThe Nuclear Strike By Russia on America and Canada\n\n\u201cFor a nation has come up against her out of the north; it will make her land an object of horror, and there will be no inhabitant in it. Both man and beast have wandered off, they have gone away! (Jeremiah 50:3)\n\nFor a nation has come up against her out of the north\n\n= 1962 or 62+19 = 81 of or 8+1 = 9\n\n= 3006 or 30+6 = 36 or 9\n\n= 501 or 5+0+1 = 6\n\nFor the Russian Federation will launch a nuclear strike on America and Canada from Russia\n\n= 3874 or 74+38 = 112 or 11-2 = 9\n\n= 4818 or 48+18 = 66 or 6\n\n= 803 or 8+0+3 = 11 or 10-1 = 9\n\nThe Russian nuclear strike will occur after the UN blue helmet invasion after America has been stripped of its assets.\n\nThere are three individuals in North America that play important roles in bringing on the destruction of America. The first two individuals are Donald Trump and Michael Pence who are, as mentioned previously, in my previous articles, Marduk and Bel.\n\nJustin Trudeau\n\nThe third individual is Justin Trudeau who is the transmigrated Justianian I.\n\nJustinian I, Latin in full Flavius Justinianus, original name Petrus Sabbatius, (born 483, Tauresium, Dardania [probably near modern Skopje, North Macedonia]\u2014died November 14, 565, Constantinople [now Istanbul, Turkey]), Byzantine emperor (527\u2013565), noted for his administrative reorganization of the imperial government and for his sponsorship of a codification of laws known as the Code of Justinian (Codex Justinianus; 534).\n\nDuring Emperor Justinian\u2019s reign in Rome, the following events occurred:\n\n1) bubonic plague\n\n2) earthquakes and tidal waves\n\n3) the sun reduced its heat lowering earth\u2019s temperature\n\n4) famine occurred.\n\nJustin Pierre James Trudeau\n\n= 2594 or 94+25 = 117 or 17+1 = 18 or 6\n\n= 1812 or 12+18 = 30 or 6 (also equates to a year)\n\n= 302 or 30+2 = 32 or 8.\n\nPetrus Sabbatius\n\n= 1030 or 30+10 = 40 or 8\n\n= 1158 or 58+11 = 69 or 96 or 9+6=15 or 1+5= 6\n\n= 193 or 19-3 = 16 or 6\n\nFlavius Justinianus\n\n= 2405 or 24+5 = 29 or 2+9 = 11 or 8\n\n= 1482 or 82+14 = 96 or 9+6 = 15 or 1+5 = 6\n\n= 247 or 47-2 = 45 or 54 reversed or 6\n\nFidel Alejandro Castro Ruz\n\n= 1949 or 49-19 = 30 or 6\n\n= 1542 or 42+15 = 57 or 5+7 = 12 or 6\n\n= 257 or 25+7=32 or 8\n\nJustin Trudeau is the transmigrated Petrus Sabbatius later known as Falvius Justinianus and the son of Fidel Castro. I believe Justin Trudea was born a girl and later turned into a boy.\n\nFidel Castro was also the transmigrated Petrus Sabbatius later known as Falvius Justianus.\n\nIt is my contention that both Fidel Castro and Justin Trudeau are possessed, as was Justinian I according to the historian Precopius in his Aprocryphia. I also believe Fidel Castro is Justin Trudeau\u2019s father.\n\nThe Holy Gematria number 1812 also equates to a year. It is not a coincidence but rather a planned occurrence that the year 1812 is in the Holy Gematria of Justin Trudeau\u2019s name. On a visit to the White House by Justin Trudeau on June 20, 2019, Trump and Trudeau posed for photographs in front of a painting by Tom Freeman entitled \u201cThe Night They Burned The White House\u201d, an event that happened during the War of 1812 on August 24, 1814.\n\nI believe Washington and the White House will eventually be destroyed in war as the bible always tell us what will happen prior to its occurrence. The White House will burn down, possibly during the assassination of Trump and Pence, and Trudeau will have been involved.\n\nThe U.S. Government have already built a new capital in Denver to move the administration centre of the U.S. government to when Washington is destroyed. John Moore tells us that the US government are expecting a flood in Washington and that is why the centre of government is moving to Denver but I believe it will be destroyed by fire. A flood could mean an invasion of Washington.\n\nAt the 72nd Academy Awards, Robin Williams, who was a fallen watcher, performed the song \u201cLet\u2019s Blame Canada\u201d. The song contained the lyrics \u201cfly the friendly skies between Margaret Trudeau\u2019s thighs.\u201d Canada will be blamed for America\u2019s destruction. Margaret Trudeau is the mother of Justin Trudeau and Fidel Castro was Justin Trudeau\u2019s father.\n\nRobin Williams \u2013 Blame Canada (From \u201cSouth Park \u2013 Bigger Longer and Uncut\u201d)\n\nSo who does the Bible tell us America\u2019s enemies are?\n\nJeremiah 51:27-29:\n\nLift up a signal in the land, Blow a trumpet among the nations! Consecrate the nations against her, Summon against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz; Appoint a marshal against her, Bring up the horses like bristly locusts. Consecrate the nations against her, The kings of the Medes, Their governors and all their prefects, And every land of their dominion. So the land quakes and writhes, For the purposes of the LORD against Babylon stand, To make the land of Babylon A desolation without inhabitants. (Jeremiah 51:27-29)\n\nThe God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob considers America and Britain modern day Babylon, and will surely destroy America and Britain as He has sworn to do (Jeremiah 51). So what countries will destroy America and Britain? Jeremiah 51:57 tells us that our enemies are Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz:\n\nLift up a signal in the land, Blow a trumpet among the nations! Consecrate the nations against her, Summon against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz; Appoint a marshal against her, Bring up the horses like bristly locusts.

Consecrate the nations against her, Summon against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz; Appoint a marshal against her, Bring up the horses like bristly locusts.

The Tribe of Judah also settled on the western side of Germany but Germany has been infiltrated by the Ashkenaz much like the other Israelite / White Christian Nations like Britain, Western Europe and the USA.\n\nRevelation Chapters 17 and 18 along with the mirror image of Jeremiah Chapters 50 and 51 describe America as the following:\n\n1) Reigning military power (Jeremiah 50:23).\n\n\u201cHow the hammer of the whole earth has been cut off and broken! How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations! (Jeremiah 50:23)\n\n2) Main importer and consumer of goods.

And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor, and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. 8Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. 9Then I said, \u201cI will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u2019s flesh.\u201d 10And I took my staff, Favor, and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 11So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. (Zechariah 11:7-11)\n\nThe Covenant With Favor and Union Has Been Broken (Zechariah 11)\n\nMany have asked me if I have correctly identified the tribes of Israel, then how is it possible that the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob would cancel His blessings and protection on His chosen people?\n\nThe Holy Scriptures explains how this happened. Joseph\u2019s two sons Manasseh and Ephraim were blessed by Jacob. Manasseh is America and Ephraim is Britain. Britain is the only country that at one time was recipient of all of Jacob\u2019s blessings, as well as having the colony of America that was prophesied by Jacob to become a separate country. In Zechariah 11:10-14 God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob breaks the staffs of Union and Favor representing God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s covenant of protection He had with the people of America (Favor) and Union (Britain).\n\nThe question we must ask now is why the Covenant with Manasseh and Ephraim would be broken? Britain and the USA have committed the same crimes as Sodom and Gomorrah namely abortions, idolatry, corruption, racketerring, adultery, fornication, infanticide, homosexuality, transsexuals, transgenders, pornography, pedophiles, pedavores, fileting children in cannibalism, drinking blood, child and sex trafficking, human organ and blood trafficking, drug trafficking and addiction, prostitution, sexual immorality, incest, beastiality, pride, blasphemy, Gnosticism, transhumanism, sorcery, witchcraft, pharmakeia changing our DNA, and child and human sacrifice. Any moron can see we have broken the Commandments and Ordinances that were given to us at Mount Sinai. We were also expressly forbidden to intermarry from outside our Tribes.\n\nThe commandments and ordinances that Moses gave our forefathers in Mount Sinai are still in effect. It was only the ceremonial law that was done away with the ripping of the veil in the temple after Jesus died and was resurrected three days later. Jesus The Messiah was the perfect sacrifice and it is blasphemy to begin to perform any animal sacrifices whatsoever.\n\nThe Old Testament Law\n\nThe Old Testament Law identifies sin and teaches the need for salvation; God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s grace gives us that salvation through Jesus the Messiah.\n\nThere are over 600 Jewish Ceremonial Laws and Rituals listed in the Old Testament. These are the laws that Paul said no longer apply.\n\nCeremonial Law: This type of law related to Israelites\u2019 worship. (Lev 1:1-13) The laws pointed forward to Jesus Christ and were no longer necessary after Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection. Though we are no longer bound to them, the principles behind the ceremonial laws, to worship and love God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob, still apply.\n\nCivil Law: This law dictated the Israelites\u2019 daily living (Deut 24:10-11); but modern society and culture are so radically different that some of these guidelines cannot be followed specifically. The principles behind the commands are to guide our conduct.\n\nMoral Law: The moral laws are direct commands of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. A good example is the Ten Commandments (Ex 20:1-17). The moral laws reveal the nature and will of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and still apply to us today. We do not obey this moral law as a way to obtain salvation, but to live in ways pleasing to our Father.\n\nThe Old Testament Law is where God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob reveals His nature, His will/lifestyle for humanity, His moral laws, and guidelines for living. But we cannot be saved by keeping that Law; we must be born again and trust in Jesus.\n\nJesus came not to destroy the Law and the Prophets but to fulfill them.\n\nIn Matthew 5:17, Jesus says that He did not come to abolish the Law and the Prophets. In other words, Jesus\u2019 purpose was not to abrogate the Word, dissolve it, or render it invalid. The Prophets will be fulfilled; the Law will continue to accomplish the purpose for which it was given (see Isaiah 55:10-11).\n\nNext, consider what Jesus did do. Jesus says that He came to fulfill the Law and the Prophets. In other words, Jesus\u2019 purpose was to establish the Word, to embody it, and to fully accomplish all that was written. \u201cChrist is the culmination of the law\u201d (Romans 10:4). The predictions of the Prophets concerning the Messiah would be realized in Jesus; the holy standard of the Law would be perfectly upheld by Jesus, the strict requirements personally obeyed, and the ceremonial observances finally and fully satisfied.\n\nJesus the Messiah fulfilled the Prophets in that, in His first coming alone, He fulfilled hundreds of prophecies concerning Himself (e.g., Matthew 1:22; 13:35; John 19:36; Luke 24:44). Jesus the Messiah fulfilled the Law in at least two ways: as a teacher and as a doer. He taught people to obey the Law (Matthew 22:35\u201340; Mark 1:44), and He obeyed the Law Himself (John 8:46; 1 Peter 2:22). In living a perfect life, Jesus fulfilled the moral laws; in His sacrificial death, Jesus fulfilled the ceremonial laws. Jesus the Messiah came not to destroy the old religious system but to build upon it; He came to finish the Old Covenant and establish the New.\n\nJesus came not to destroy the Law and the Prophets but to fulfill them. In fact, the ceremonies, sacrifices, and other elements of the Old Covenant were \u201conly a shadow of the good things that are coming\u2014not the realities themselves\u201d (Hebrews 10:1). The tabernacle and temple were \u201choly places made with hands,\u201d but they were never meant to be permanent; they were but \u201ccopies of the true things\u201d (Hebrews 9:24, ESV). The Law had a built-in expiration date, being filled as it was with \u201cexternal regulations applying until the time of the new order\u201d (Hebrews 9:10). God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob will establish His wonderful new world order and the devil will establish his stinking new world odor run by his chosen people the Jews as the counterfeit authority to that of God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. Christian\u2019s are in for some exciting times as our savior Jesus is at the door.\n\nIn His fulfillment of the Law and Prophets, Jesus obtained our eternal salvation. No longer were priests required to offer sacrifices and enter the holy place (Hebrews 10:8\u201314). Jesus has done that for us, once and for all. By grace through faith, we are made right with God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob. \u201cHe forgave us all our sins, having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross\u201d (Colossians 2:14).\n\n\u201cFor truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is accomplished. (Matthew 5:18)\n\nOur Days Are Like Those Of Lot\n\n28\u201cIt was the same as happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building; 29but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. 30\u201cIt will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed. (Luke 17:28-30)\n\nJust as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example, in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 1:7)\n\nand, although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them. (Romans 1:32)\n\nThe Rise of False Prophets\n\n4For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment; 5and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; 6and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly thereafter; (2 Peter 2:4-6)\n\nThe root of Sodom\u2019s sin was love of self rather than love of the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob.\n\nZechariah 11:9-14 tells us that the covenant with all the Tribes of Israel including the special relationship with Ephraim and Manasseh has been broken. The Land of Palestine belongs to the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and no one should have entered the land of Palestine in 1948 when the land was actually returned to the Tribes of Israel. The Jews of today were never in Judea during the times of Jesus and they invented the story to make believe that they were the chosen people (see Shlomo Sand \u201cThe Invention of the Jewish People\u201d and \u201cThe Invention Of the Land of Israel). The Tribes of Jacob surnamed Israel were not to enter Palestine until the return of Jesus, who will lead us to our Promised Land in the second Greater Exodus out of Egypt.\n\n\u201cThe LORD has broken the staff of the wicked, The scepter of rulers (Isaiah 14:5)\n\nThe staff\n\n= 316 or 3+1+6=10 or 10-1= 9\n\n= 510 or 10+5+15 or 5+1+0 = 6\n\n= 85 or 8+5 = 13 or 1+3 = 4\n\nGod of Abraham Isaac and Jacob\u2019s protection\n\n= 1632 or 632-1=631 or 6+3+1=10-1 =9\n\n= 1968 or 1+9+6+8=24 or 2+4 = 6\n\n= 328 or 28+3 or 82 reversed + 3 = 85 or 8+5 = 13 or or 1+3 = 4\n\nThe numbers 316 and 631 and 85 match as well as the three witnesses of Holy Gematria (9-6-4).\n\nThe sceptre\n\n= 343 or 43+3 = 46 or 64 or 8\n\n= 516 or 16+5 = 21 or 7\n\n= 86 or 8+6 = 14 or 7\n\nThe Wisdom\n\n= 1196 or 96-19 = 86 or 8+6=14 or 7\n\n= 696 or 6+9+6 = 21 or 7\n\n= 116 or 1+1+6= 8\n\nSo I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock.

(Revelation 18:11-13)\n\nThe Bible seems to indicate that a third of the population of the Tribes of Jacob Israel today will die by famine and pestilence, a third will die by war and invasion, and a third will be scattered throughout the world as slaves.\n\nIt will be this last third who will be enslaved who will eventually be released and take part in the Greater Second Exodus as the saved remnant.\n\nIsaiah 11:11-12: The Restored Remnant\n\n11Then it will happen on that day that the Lord\n\nWill again recover the second time with His hand\n\nThe remnant of His people, who will remain,\n\nFrom Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath,\n\nAnd from the islands of the sea.\n\n12And He will lift up a standard for the nations,\n\nAnd will assemble the banished ones of Israel,\n\nAnd will gather the dispersed of Judah\n\nFrom the four corners of the earth.

Many millions will be beheaded by guillotines for their belief in Jesus. The Noahide Laws will be enforced making it legal to kill Christians. The non-saved Elect sent to FEMA camps will only be held and tortured for a maximum of ten days until they are beheaded (Revelation 2:10). The Christian saved Elect who have been sealed on their foreheads will not be killed but will be imprisoned and tortured for five months before being shipped outside the country to work camps if they are between fifteen and fifty years old.

This is just an example assuming something happens to the two imposter prophets happens at the end of July 2020.\n\nArmageddon\n\nI believe Armageddon would then occur after midnight on December 18th, 2020.

(1 Cor. 15:24-25; Rev. 21:4)\n\nGreater Second Exodus\n\nSome of the saved elect will remain on earth for the Greater Second Exodus and will be outside of the Christian Israelite Nations in work camps. When the time comes and God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob calls for them, the elect will be released from slave labour camps and sent by ship to Egypt for the Greater Exodus (Deut. 28:68) where the remnant will be regathered.\n\nIsaac and Rebekah will be in Egypt to lead their descendants, the true Children of Israel, out of Egypt to their home in their Promised Land in the Second Greater Exodus with our Savior, Jesus the Messiah (Genesis 48:21). After Jesus the Messiah touches down to earth with His Myriad of Holy Angels (millions), He will deal with the armies surrounding Jerusalem in Bozrah and the Gog and Magog War and clear the land before bringing His people, the Christians, home to the promised land.\n\nThen Israel said to Joseph, \u201cBehold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and bring you back to the land of your fathers. (Genesis 48:21)\n\nJust as Jacob defrauded the birthright from Esau as Esau was the elder twin, the so called Jews today, who say they are Jews and are not but do lie, are of the synagogue of Satan, (Revelation 2:9 and 3:9) have defrauded the white Western European Nations of their birthright. The Jews have fraudulently taken our birthright as The Children of Israel and now are encouraging intermarriage between white and non-white races to change our DNA and make a melting pot mongrel race out of all of us. Once Jesus returns permanently to earth to destroy all evil He will gather the legitimate \u201cChildren of Israel\u201d or Jacob-Israel or all the Tribes of Israel as there must be a second Greater Exodus out of Egypt. (Deuteronomy 28:68, Isaiah 11:11-12 and Isaiah 27:12-12). Israel in the Holy Bible always refers to the Tribes of Israel and not the land mass.\n\nIsaac and Rebekah will be in Egypt to lead their descendants, the true Children of Israel, out of Egypt to their home in their Promised Land in the Second Greater Exodus with our Savior, Jesus the Messiah Leading All The Tribes of Israel and all the Christians grafted in, to the Promised Land. (Genesis 28:15,48:21,50:24; Deut. 30:3).\n\nAs a Christian, we are commanded not to make pledges or oaths.\n\nThere are two passages in scripture that are relevant to this question for the New Testament believer.\n\nThe first is found in Matthew 5:\n\n\u201c33 \u201cAgain, you have heard that the ancients were told, \u2018You shall not make false vows, but shall fulfill your vows to the Lord.\u2019 34 But I say to you, make no oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, 35 or by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Nor shall you make an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 But let your statement be, \u2018Yes, yes\u2019 or \u2018No, no\u2019; anything beyond these is of evil.\u201d The second is in James 5: \u201c12 But above all, my brethren, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath; but your yes is to be yes, and your no, no, so that you may not fall under judgment.\u201d\n\nJames is clearly echoing Jesus\u2019 words. The Bible teaches Christians should not take oaths and pledges. Anyone taking a pledge to Lucifer will be condemned. Also anyone that is going to take the Mark of Beast or Digitial ID 2020 which includes the Killer Gate\u2019s Covid-19 vaccines and covid-19 contaminated swab tests and the digital body interfacing currency, will be condemned and there will be no redemption.\n\nThe mark of the beast is a mark that will be placed on a person\u2019s forehead or right hand in the end times as a sign of allegiance to the Antichrist (Revelation 13:15\u201318). Further, no one will be allowed to engage in commerce without the mark (Revelation 13:17). It appears that some form of worship of the Antichrist is associated with receiving the mark (Revelation 14:9; 16:2), and those who refuse to worship the image of the beast will be killed (Revelation 13:15).\n\nThe question then arises as to whether a person who has received the mark of the beast can be forgiven. The answer to this question seems to be \u201cno.\u201d Revelation 14:10\u201311, describing the fate of someone who takes the mark of the beast, declares, \u201cHe also will drink the wine of God\u2019s wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.\u201d\n\nThe eternal destiny of those who take the mark of the beast is the lake of fire. Why is taking the mark of the beast a damnable sin against God? Why would God condemn a person to hell for taking the mark of the beast? It would appear that taking the mark of the beast will be a blasphemous act of willful defiance against God. Receiving the mark of the beast is essentially worshipping Satan. Those who take the mark have made the choice to serve Satan rather than obey God and receive Christ as Savior. When people make that decision during the tribulation, God will grant their request to be eternally separated from Him.\n\nThis post is the thirtieth installment of a continuing series by chapter on deciphering the prophecy of Revelation and the Holy Scriptures through the use of Holy Gematria.\n\nSee all of Dr. Luke Prophet\u2019s articles on the Book of Revelation for the complete Rubber Necker\u2019s guide to Armageddon.

This is why the Jews have been pushing racial integration and race mixing throughout Europe and America to reduce the white race population and weaken the white nations.\n\n\u201cWe must realize that our party\u2019s most powerful weapon is racial tensions. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by whites, we can mold them to the program of the Communist Party. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negro minority against the whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negros. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.\u201d\n\nIsrael Cohen, A Racial Program for he Twentieth Century, 1912. Also in the Congressional Record, Vol. 103, p. 8559, June 7, 1957\n\nhttps://www.stormfront.org/forum/t52756/\n\nMyron Fagan, a Jew substantiates the quote by Israel Cohen above. Here\u2019s what he says about it:\n\n\u201cAround 1910; one Israel Zengwill wrote a play entitled \u201cThe Melting- Pot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was sheer propaganda to incite the Negroes and Jews because the play purportedly visualized how the American people were discriminating against, and persecuting Jews and Negroes.\n\n\u201cAt that time nobody seemed to realize that it was a propaganda play.\n\n\u201cIt was that cleverly-written.\n\n\u201cThe propaganda was well wrapped-up in the truly great entertainment in the play and it was a big Broadway Hit.\n\n\u201cNow in those years, the legendary Diamond Jim Brady used to throw a banquet at the famous Delmonico Restaurant in New York after the opening-performance of a popular play.\n\nILLUMINATI INFORMATION: DANGEROUS \u201cART\u201d BEGINS TO EMERGE\n\n\u201cHe threw such a party for the cast of \u201cThe Melting-Pot,\u201d its author, producer, and chosen Broadway-celebrities. By then I\u2019d already made a personal mark on the Broadway Theater and was invited to that party. There I met George Bernard Shaw and a Jewish writer named Israel Cohen.\n\n\u201cZangwill, Shaw, and Cohen were the ones who created the Fabian Society in England and had worked closely with a Frankfurt Jew named Mordicai who had changed his name to Karl Marx; but remember, at that time both Marxism and Communism were just emerging and nobody paid much attention to either and nobody suspected the propaganda in the writings of those three really brilliant writers.\n\n\u201cAt that banquet; Israel Cohen told me that he was then engaged in writing a book which was to be a follow-up on Zangwill\u2019s \u201cThe Melting-Pot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe title of his book was to be \u201cA Racial-Program for the 20th Century.\u201d At that time I was completely absorbed by my work as a playwright, and significant as that title was, its real objective never dawned on me nor was I interested in reading the book.\n\n\u201cBut it suddenly hit me with the force of a hydrogen-bomb when I received a newspaper-clipping of an item published by the Washington D.C. Evening Star in May 1957. That item was a verbatim reprint of the following excerpt in Israel Cohen\u2019s book \u201cA Racial-Program for the 20th Century\u201d and it read as I quote:\n\nILLUMINATI INFORMATION: QUOTE FROM \u201cA RACIAL PROGRAM\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must realize that our party\u2019s most powerful weapon is racial-tension.\n\n\u201c\u2018By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races, that for centuries they have been oppressed by the whites, we can move them to the program of the communist party.\n\n\u201cIn America; we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negro minority against the whites; we will instill in the whites a guilt-complex for their exploitation of the Negroes.\n\n\u201cWe will aid the Negroes to rise to prominence in every walk of life, in the professions, and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige; the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.\u2019\n\nILLUMINATI INFORMATION: RECRUITING COMMUNISTS\n\n\u201c\u2026 Thus the authenticity of that passage in Cohen\u2019s book was fully\n\nestablished. But the one question that remained in my mind was whether it represented the official policy or plot of the Communist Party or just a personal expression of Cohen himself.\n\n\u201cHence I sought more proof and I found it in an official pamphlet published in 1935 by the New York Communist Party\u2019s official Workers\u2019 Library Publishers.\n\n\u201cThat pamphlet was entitled: \u201cThe Negroes in a Soviet America.\u201d It urged the Negroes to rise-up; form a soviet state in the south, and apply for admission to the Soviet Union. It contained a firm pledge that the revolt would be supported by all American \u201creds\u201d and all so-called \u201cliberals\u201d.\n\n\u201cOn page 38; it promised that a Soviet government would confer greater benefits to Negroes than to whites and again this official communist pamphlet pledged that; I quote: \u2018any act of discrimination or prejudice against a Negro will become a crime under the revolutionary law.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat statement proved that the excerpt in Israel Cohen\u2019s book published in 1913 was an official-edict of the Communist Party and directly in line with the Illuminati-blueprint for world-revolution issued by Weishaupt and later by Albert Pike.\n\nILLUMINATI INFORMATION: RECRUITING COMMUNISTS\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s only one question and that is to prove that the communist regime is directly controlled by the American Jacob Schiff and London Rothschild masterminds of the great conspiracy.\n\n\u201cA little later I will provide that proof that will remove even a remote doubt that the Communist Party, as we know it, was created by those masterminds (capitalists if you will note)\u2026\n\n\u201cSchiff, the Warburgs, and the Rothschilds that planned and financed the entire Russian Revolution; the murder of the Czar and his family, and that Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin took their orders directly from Schiff and the other capitalists whom they supposedly are fighting.\n\n\u201cNow can you see why the vile Earl Warren and his equally vile co-Supreme Court justices issued that infamous and treasonous desegregation decision in 1954? It was to aid and abet the plot of the Illuminati conspirators to create tension and strife between the Negroes and Whites.\n\n\u201cCan you see why the same Earl Warren issued his decision prohibiting Christian-prayers and Christmas carols in our schools? Why Kennedy did likewise? And can you see why Johnson and 66 Senators, despite the protests of 90% of the American people, voted for the \u201cConsular Treaty\u201d which opens our entire country to Russian spies and saboteurs?\n\n\u201cAll those 66 Senators are 20th century Benedict Arnolds.\u201d\n\nAbove excerpt comes from The Illuminati and the Council on Foreign Relations, by Myron Fagan.

The menace, gentlemen, is the Jews. In whatever country Jews have settled in any great number, they have lowered its moral tone; depreciated its commercial integrity; have segregated themselves and have not been assimilated; have sneered at and tried to undermine the Christian religion upon which that nation is founded, by objecting to its restrictions; have built up a state within the state; and when opposed have tried to strangle that country to death financially, as in the case of Spain and Portugal.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor over 1,700 years, the Jews have been bewailing their sad fate in that they have been exiled from their homeland, as they call Palestine. But gentlemen, did the world give it to them in fee simple, they would at once find some reason for not returning. Why? Because they are vampires, and vampires do not live on vampires. They cannot live only among themselves. They must subsist on Christians and other people not of their race.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do not exclude them from these United States, in their Constitution, in less than 200 years they will have swarmed here in such great numbers that they will dominate and devour the land and change our form of government, for which we Americans have shed our blood, given our lives our substance and jeopardized our liberty.\u201d \u201cIf you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our descendants will be working in the fields to furnish them substance, while they will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands. I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude Jews for all time, your children will curse you in your graves.\u201d\n\n\u201cJews, gentlemen, are Asiatic (Khazars \u2013 GOG & MaGOG of Russia), let them be born where they will nor how many generations they are away from Asia, they will never be otherwise. Their ideas do not conform to an American\u2019s, and will not even thou they live among us ten generations. A leopard cannot change its spots. Jews are Asiatics, (Khazars) are a menace to this country if permitted entrance, and should be excluded by this Constitutional Convention.\u201d\n\nBen Franklin, 1789.\n\nSecret Societies are Controlled by the Jews to bring about the Jewish Controlled New World Order\n\nMysterious Force was the original name of Freemasonry, which started in 43 A.D and later took on the name of Freemasonry started in 1717 by Joseph Levy and Abraham Abuid to bring in more European men, then to to destroy Christianity that was growing to fast for them to infiltrate\u2013Facts and fictions of Freemasonry by Margaret C.

Those that say are Jews but are not but do lie (Rev. 2:9 and Rev. 3.9). The Serpent who seduced Eve is the father of Cain and his descendnats and the Fallen Angels and Demons manifest in the Serpent Seed Race of the Khazarian Jews. People that sell their soul to the devil also tend turn to the Jewish race and the Kaballah just look at Madonna and Sammy Davis Jr and all the Hollywood stars wearing the red kaballah bracelet. All the evil is back on earth and for whatever reason, the evil spirits predominantly manifest in the Jewish race. The evil spirits can take over any body if the person is sinful or inviting evil spirits in or have idols. Make sure you get rid of your idols so as not to attract any evil spirits.\n\nThe Jews do not consider themselves white and come in all colors. Barack Obama is a Jew. There are many crypto jews that change their name to hide their jewish roots like Kill Bill Gates and Donald Trump and alot of Hollywood actors to hide their true identity.\n\nObama, as far as I know, has never revealed that he is half Jewish. Donald Trump wants to hide that he is a Jew.\u2026 Why? Too many Jews remain crypto in our government, corporations and banking, running the show from behind the veiled curtains of racial anonymity.\n\nIronically, If these Jews were any other race on the planet they would let us know about it, claiming anti-Semitism, racism, discrimination, prejudice, bigotry, xenophobia and racial intolerance\u2026 so why do the rest of us put up with this Jewish hypocritical deceit?\n\nWhat do these Jews have to hide?

Notice in Revelation 6:2 the rider on the white horse is described as having a bow, but not a quiver containing arrows. In other words, Trump is nothing but a windbag who will only try to negotiate himself out of a uncomfortable situation. The white horse symbolizes salvation. Notice Jesus on his return rides a white horse (Revelation 19:11). Trump is not our Savior and certainly is not offering salvation in any shape or form. Many Americans voted for Trump as they saw him as the Savior of America, and others voted for Trump as the lessor of two evils, the other being evil Hillary. In either case, the dice were loaded against you as the Illuminati in America select your Presidential candidates, dictate who wins the elections, and believe they have control of all events here on earth. Trump stated: \u201cI am the chosen one\u201d, words that were used by Trump to describe himself. Trump is an actor and has been given a role to play in this production we are all witnesses to in order to bring this age, or the age of Pisces, to a close.\n\nThere is only one Savior of us all and that is Yeshua (Jesus) the Messiah and not Trump (Marduk) or anyone else. God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is both producer and director of this play we are all in the middle of and God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob warned us of all of these events unfolding before our eyes through His prophets. Trump is a false antiChrist and false prophet and a poor warm up act for the arrival of the true antiChrist, the leader of the one world government and one world monetary systems. The antiChrist is a type and there are many antiChrists here on earth today! (1 John 2:18). This is the last hour and Jesus is at the door! Jeremiah 50:2 confirms that Bel and Marduk will be shattered in Babylon (America). Trump is Marduk and Bel is Vice President Pence.\n\nUsing the Gematria calculator at gematrix.org so you can follow along. I compare the bible verse to the underlying meaning of the bible verse with my helper the Holy Spirit and reduce the Gematria number to a single digit. I compare the final ending single digits from the bible verse to the underlying meaning and if I get 3 matching witnesses, then I am confident that I have found a match to the meaning of the bible veerse.\n\n\u201cDeclare and proclaim among the nations. Proclaim it and lift up a standard. Do not conceal it but say, \u2018Babylon has been captured, Bel has been put to shame, Marduk has been shattered; Her images have been put to shame, her idols have been shattered.\u2019 (Jeremiah 50:2)\n\nBabylon has been captured\n\n= 1119 or 1+1+1+9 = 12 or 6\n\n= 1278 or 78+12 = 90 or 9\n\n= 213 or 21+3 = 24 or 6\n\nAmerica has been captured\n\n= 733 or 33+7 = 40 or 10-1= 9\n\n= 1152 or 52+2 = 54 or 6\n\n= 192 or 1+9+2 = 12 or 6\n\nMarduk\n\n= 325 or 3+2+5 = 10 or 10-1 = 9\n\n= 408 or 40+8 = 48 or 8\n\n= 68 or 6+8 = 14 or 7\n\nDonald John Trump\n\n= 1287 or 87+12 = 99 or 9+9 = 18 or 1+8 = 9\n\n= 1110 or 10-(1+1) = 10-2 = 8\n\n= 185 or 1+8+5 = 14 or 7\n\nBel\n\n= 27 or 7-2 = 5\n\n= 114 or 1+1+4 = 6\n\n= 19 or 9-1 = 8\n\nMichael Richard Pence\n\n= 374 or 37+4 = 41 or 4+1= 5\n\n= 930 or 9+3+0 = 12 or 6\n\n= 155 or 1+5+5 = 11 or 8\n\nThe Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Leading the Tribes of Israel (Christian Nations) on a Parade to Armageddon \u2013 Now Unveiled!

Messiah ben Joseph (who will be killed) and the Messiah ben David. Donald Trump, who is Jewish is King of Edom (Modern Jewry) and will be declared Messiah Ben Joseph after he is assassinated and raised from the dead 3\u00bd days later. Donald Trump\u2019s youngest son Barron will be declared Messiah Ben David. This prophecy is all according to the Chabad Lubavitch movement and the Edomites (Modern Jewry). These Edomite Jews believe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, their Rebbe, will transmigrate and return. Barron Trump has the same Gematria numbers as Menachem Mendel Schneerson and the Jews will say Barron Trump is the transmigrated Menachem Mendel Schneerson because of matching Gematria numbers. Everything is about the number with the Jews and they even murder by the numbers. These Edomites (modern Jewry) will have a one way ticket to the Lake of Fire.\n\nMessiah Ben David\n\n= 998 or 99-8 = 91 or 9+1 = 10 or 10-1 = 9\n\n= 810 or 10+8 = 18 or 6\n\n= 135 or 35+1 = 36 or 6\n\nMenachem Mendel Schneerson\n\n= 637 or 63+7 = 70 or 10 or 10-1 = 9\n\n= 1410 or 10+14 = 24 or 6 (see below)\n\n= 235 or 53-2 = 51 or 5+1= 6 (see below)\n\nBarron William Trump\n\n= 1712 or 1+7+1+2 = 11 or 9\n\n= 1410 or 10+14 = 24 or 6 (see above)\n\n= 235 or 23-5 = 18 or 6 (see above)\n\nBarron Trump, youngest son of Donald Trump, will be proclaimed the Messiah Ben David who I believe is the transmigrated Menachem Mendel Schneerson according to the three matching witnesses in Holy Gematria. According to Holy Gematria, Barron Trump is the transmigrated Menachem Schneerson and will be declared the Messiah Ben David by Chabad Lubavitch, as they both have 1410 and 235 in their Gematria numbers and, as well, they both match 6-6-9.

But on Tuesday, DHS acting Secretary Chad Wolf said he was instructing staff \u201cto take all appropriate actions to reject all pending and future initial requests for DACA\u201d and exercise its authority to \u201cto terminate or deny deferred action at any time when immigration officials determine termination or denial of deferred action is appropriate.\u201d\n\nAs of December, there were about 107,000 Texans with DACA permits, according to federal statistics. The program applies to undocumented immigrants [illegal aliens] who came to the country before they were 16 [many of whom, various reports have shown, are gang members] and who were 30 or younger as of June 2012. The program gave each recipient a renewable, two-year work permit and a reprieve from deportation.\n\nThe DHS announcement Tuesday also limits the protection for recipients who renew their DACA permits to one year instead of the original 24 months.\n\n\u201cAs the Department continues looking at the policy and considers future action, the fact remains that Congress should act on this matter,\u201d Wolf said in a statement. \u201cThere are important policy reasons that may warrant the full rescission of the DACA policy.\u201d\n\nEven after what many believed was a loss for the Trump administration at the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, the president said he was instead given time to figure out how to end the program.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court asked us to resubmit on DACA, nothing was lost or won,\u201d Trump tweeted at the time. But he made statements arguing that he had the power to implement action on DACA that would protect young immigrants, though he was unclear on details.\n\nFernando Garcia, the executive director of the El Paso-based Border Network for Human Rights, said Trump is trying to please immigration hardliners while also courting moderates who favor keeping DACA in place.\n\n\u201cThey are not [completely] terminating DACA because of politics, but at the same time they are taking a strong stance and saying they are going to limit the program,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they also have power to cancel permits so what they are trying to do is also send a message that they are trying to be tough on Dreamers.\u201d\n\nTodd Schulte, the president of FWD.us, an immigration and criminal-justice reform group, said the move Tuesday goes against popular public sentiment and could backfire. [His opinion.]\n\n\u201cKilling DACA was wrong in 2017. It is wrong today,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe President lost in the highest court in the land and he has lost decisively in the court of public opinion. Continuing a pattern of three years of a huge public reaction against his anti-immigrants agenda, the President\u2019s actions today are widely unpopular because they will hurt our country, and will continue to create massive challenges for him in the upcoming election.\u201d\n\nIf the Wolf memo issued Tuesday is any indicator, the White House will likely put pressure on Congress to act and blame lawmakers if there is not a comprehensive solution in the late months of a contentious election year.\n\n\u201cEven if the DACA policy could have been justified as a temporary measure when it was created, Congress arguably has had more than sufficient time to consider affording permanent status or immigration relief to the class of aliens covered by the policy,\u201d Wolf wrote. \u201cAnd yet, although various proposals have been advanced to do that, Congress has so far declined to take action.\u201d", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/trump-administration-rejects-new-daca-applicants-cuts-protection-by-12-months/", "author": []}, {"title": "Law Enforcement Acts Against Dems: 100 Agencies \u2018Withdraw\u2019 From DNC Agreements", "text": "As democrats continue to make war against law enforcement throughout the country by supporting riots and defunding police, law enforcement officials have responded by withdrawing security agreements to protect the Democratic Nation Committee Convention next month in Milwaukee.\n\nJS Online reported:\n\nAt least 100 law enforcement agencies have withdrawn agreements to send personnel to next month\u2019s Democratic National Convention, some of them citing orders to Milwaukee\u2019s police chief to cease the use of tear gas and pepper spray during demonstrations.\n\nThe withdrawals cast doubt on a program to bring about 1,000 police officers from outside agencies to help shore up security for the event, scheduled for the week of Aug 17. Among the agencies confirmed to have withdrawn are police departments in Fond du Lac, Franklin, Greendale and West Allis.\n\nAsked on Monday if the agreements were collapsing, Fond du Lac Police Chief William Lamb said, \u201cYes,\u201d adding that he expects other agencies from across the state to withdraw from the program.\n\n\u201cWe regret having to do that,\u201d said Lamb, who chairs the Wisconsin Police Executive Group, which consists of police chiefs from cities with populations of more than 20,000 people.\n\nhe action by Lamb and others comes as Milwaukee\u2019s Fire and Police Commission issued a directive last week to Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales to change department policy to discontinue the use of tear gas and pepper spray.\n\nMorales spoke to several media outlets Tuesday and told at least one that more than 100 law enforcement agencies had backed out of agreements with the city for security at the convention. In a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice sent two weeks ago, Milwaukee officials listed fewer than 60 partner agencies as assisting with DNC security.\n\nPolice confirmed Tuesday afternoon that more than 100 law enforcement agencies are no longer assisting with the event.\n\n\u201cMPD\u2019s top priority remains to ensure that next month\u2019s DNC is a safe event for all visitors and participants,\u201d the department said in the statement.\n\nMorales abruptly postponed a scheduled interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe respect the Fire and Police Commission\u2019s decision,\u201d Lamb said in an interview. \u201cBut in this particular case, we strongly disagree with the actions they\u2019ve taken. We believe (that) in removing those tools, the use of chemical irritants or pepper spray, from the available resources that the law enforcement officers would have at their disposal if protests become non-peaceful would severely compromise the safety of the public and also the safety of the law enforcement officers who would be assigned to protect the DNC.\u201d\n\nLamb sent a letter to Milwaukee police on July 6 outlining his organization\u2019s concerns about limiting the use of tear gas and pepper spray. His group has not received a reply, he said, but added that he understands that the situation in Milwaukee is \u201cfluid.\u201d\n\nWest Allis police first sent a letter to Morales with concerns in mid-June after Milwaukee\u2019s Common Council temporarily halted the purchase of those chemicals. A more recent bid for barricades, pepper spray, a \u201ctactical gas delivery system,\u201d food and drink for officers and other equipment appears on its way to being fulfilled.\n\nBut then came the directive from the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that in the event protests turn non-peaceful, such a policy would remove tools from officers that may otherwise be legal and justifiable to utilize in specific situations,\u201d West Allis Deputy Chief Robert Fletcher said in an email.\n\nThe decision to withdraw was not done lightly, he said, but the department believed such a policy would compromise the safety of officers and the public.\n\nFranklin Police Chief Rick Oliva raised similar concerns in a letter he sent to Morales last week stating that his agency was no longer sending personnel to assist at the convention \u201cdue to recent decisions by Milwaukee elected and appointed officials.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is apparent there is a lack of commitment to provide the Milwaukee Police Department with the resources it needs to ensure the safety of peaceful protesters, attendees, citizens and police personnel,\u201d Oliva wrote in his July 23 letter, copies of which were sent to Mayor Tom Barrett, the Common Council president and the FPC. \u201cI can not send personnel if they are not properly equipped or will not be allowed to engage in appropriate actions which would ensure their safety.\u201d\n\nOliva noted in his letter that the agreement had said officers were to be provided \u201csufficient resources to handle multiple unruly persons,\u201d and that the deal allowed for early termination if the city \u201cfails to comply with or perform any material term, condition or obligation contained in the agreement.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to Morales Tuesday, Greendale Police Chief Ryan Rosenow echoed Oliva\u2019s message and said he would no longer be sending officers to assist.\n\nWaukesha\u2019s police chief said he is consulting with the city attorney\u2019s office on how to withdraw from the agreement, which had promised about two dozen Waukesha officers.\n\n\u201cMy position is we\u2019re not going to be sending our officers to support the DNC,\u201d said Chief Daniel Thompson, who was hired in March after a 29-year career with the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\n\u201cI understand that use of chemical irritants and pepper spray is serious and those are to be used only when legally justified,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you take that out of the continuum that doesn\u2019t leave the officers much other than getting harmed or using deadly force and that\u2019s not good for any officer or the public.\u201d\n\nThe Milwaukee Police Department declined to comment on the situation.\n\n\u201cFor security purposes and the safety of the delegates and those attending the Democratic National Convention, the Milwaukee Police Department declines to comment on the staffing for its operational plan,\u201d according to a statement released Monday evening.\n\nGriselda Aldrete, executive director of the FPC, referred questions about the issue to Commissioner Nelson Soler, who did not respond to an interview request. Soler serves as chairman of the Policies and Standards Committee, which is reviewing operating procedures for crowd control.\n\nome agencies are still planning to send officers to assist with the event.\n\nGreen Bay Police Chief Andrew Smith said at this point his department is one of them.\n\n\u201cWe made a commitment that we would assist Chief Morales and the Milwaukee Police Department,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe intend to honor that commitment.\u201d\n\nGlendale Police Captain Rhett Fugman said Monday that his department still plans to send five officers to assist with the DNC.\n\nWest Bend Police Chief Kenneth Meuler said he remains committed to sending about a dozen officers for the effort.\n\n\u201cI am confident that Chief Morales and city officials will work out an agreement to address the concerns that some of the other chiefs have raised,\u201d said Meuler, a former Milwaukee Police Department captain.\n\nThe Wisconsin State Patrol also still plans to provide security assistance at the DNC and so does the Rock County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nMilwaukee Common Council President Cavalier Johnson said the council has \u201conly asked for transparency when it comes to the use of chemical irritants \u2014 especially during a time when tensions between law enforcement and the community need to be de-escalated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very thankful to police forces from Green Bay, West Bend and other communities from across Wisconsin and the United States that not only will honor their commitment to provide security during the Democratic National Convention but also respect the moment that our nation is in as we collectively re-examine police-community relations,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers are no longer sending officers to help but said the decision was made independently of concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic and any recent directives.\n\nEau Claire Police Chief Matt Rokus said he decided against sending the 10 officers the agency had originally planned to send to assist with the convention in February.\n\n\u201cThe commitment to send 10 officers was made by our previous chief, prior to my appointment,\u201d Rokus said.\n\nHe added that Eau Claire previously had three large local music festivals and another large event planned that would have coincided with the original July dates of the DNC in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cIt really had to do with local needs at the time,\u201d Rokus said.\n\nNew Jersey State Police said Monday that their deployment of about 55 people was canceled.

The investigation extends further back in the government surveillance of Trump associates in the 2015/2016 campaign. That unmasking could, likely does, include the use of the FBI-NSA database where \u2018unmasking\u2019 is an analogous term with \u201cminimization.\u201d {Go Deep}\n\nGAIN, there is a name -a key person- that is never mentioned within these stories. One person, who no-one knows, whose name has never appeared, who is doing the larger investigative over-watch. The five member USAO team are on a separate, albeit parallel, track. That one key-person fuels my optimism [and please quit trying to guess \u2013 it\u2019s futile].\n\nDuring the time-frame of December 2015 through April 2016 the NSA database was being exploited by contractors within the intelligence community doing unauthorized searches.\n\nOn March 9, 2016, oversight personnel doing a review of FBI system access were alerted to thousands of unauthorized search queries of specific U.S. persons within the NSA database.\n\nNSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers was made aware.\n\nSubsequently NSA Director Rogers initiated a full compliance review of the system to identify who was doing the searches; & what searches were being conducted.\n\nOn April 18, 2016, following the preliminary audit results, Director Rogers shut down all FBI contractor access to the database after he learned FISA-702 \u201cabout\u201d(17) and \u201cto/from\u201d(16) search queries were being done without authorization. Thus begins the first discovery of a much bigger background story.\n\nWhen you compile the timeline with the people involved; and the specific wording of the resulting review, which was then delivered to the FISA court; and overlay the activity that was taking place in the GOP primary; what we discover is a process where the metadata collected by the NSA was being searched for political opposition research and surveillance.\n\nAdditionally, tens-of-thousands of searches were identified by the FISA court as likely extending much further than the compliance review period: \u201cwhile the government reports it is unable to provide a reliable estimate of the non compliant queries since 2012, there is no apparent reason to believe the November 2015 [to] April 2016 period coincided with an unusually high error rate\u201d.\n\nIn short, during the Obama administration the NSA database was continually used to conduct surveillance. This is the critical point that leads to understanding the origin of \u201cSpygate\u201d, as it unfolded in the Spring and Summer of 2016.\n\nIt was the discovery of the database exploitation and the removal of access as a surveillance tool that created their initial problem. Here\u2019s how we can tell.\n\nInitially in December 2015 there were 17 GOP candidates and all needed to be researched.\n\nHowever, when Donald Trump won New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina the field was significantly whittled. Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Kasich and Carson remained.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, March 2, 2016, Donald Trump won seven states (VT, AR, VA, GA, AL, TN, MA) it was then clear that Trump was the GOP frontrunner with momentum to become the presumptive nominee. On March 5th, Trump won Kentucky and Louisiana; and on March 8th Trump won Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii.\n\nThe next day, March 9th, NSA security alerts warned internal oversight personnel that something sketchy was going on.\n\nThis timing is not coincidental. As FISA Judge Rosemary Collyer later wrote in her report, \u201cmany of these non-compliant queries involved the use of the same identifiers over different date ranges.\u201d Put another way: attributes belonging to a specific individual(s) were being targeted and queried, unlawfully. Given what was later discovered, it seems obvious the primary search target, over multiple date ranges, was Donald Trump.\n\nThere were tens-of-thousands of unauthorized search queries; and as Judge Collyer stated in her report, there is no reason to believe the 85% non compliant rate was any different from the abuse of the NSA database going back to 2012.\n\nAs you will see below the NSA database was how political surveillance was being conducted during Obama\u2019s second term in office. However, when the system was flagged, and when NSA Director Mike Rogers shut down \u201ccontractor\u201d access to the system, the system users needed to develop another way to get access.\n\nMike Rogers shuts down access on April 18, 2016. On April 19, 2016, Fusion-GPS founder Glenn Simpson\u2019s wife, Mary Jacoby visits the White House. Immediately thereafter, the DNC and Clinton campaign contract Fusion GPS\u2026 who then hire Christopher Steele.\n\nKnowing it was federal \u201ccontractors\u201d, outside government with access to the system, doing the unauthorized searches, the question becomes: who were the contractors?\n\nThe possibilities are quite vast. Essentially anyone the FBI or intelligence apparatus was using could have participated. Crowdstrike was a known FBI contractor; they were also contracted by the DNC. Shawn Henry was the former head of the FBI office in DC and is now the President of Crowdstrike Services; a rather dubious contractor for the government and a politically connected data security and forensic company. James Comey\u2019s special friend Daniel Richman was an unpaid FBI \u201cspecial employee\u201d with security access to the database. Nellie Ohr began working for Fusion-GPS on the Trump project in November 2015 and she was a CIA contractor; and it\u2019s entirely likely Glenn Simpson or people within his Fusion-GPS network were also contractors for the intelligence community.\n\nRemember the Sharyl Attkisson computer intrusions? It\u2019s all part of this same network; Attkisson even names Shawn Henry as a defendant in her ongoing lawsuit.\n\nAll of the aforementioned names, and so many more, held a political agenda in 2016.\n\nIt seems likely if the NSA flags were never triggered then the contracted system users would have continued exploiting the NSA database for political opposition research; which would then be funneled to the Clinton team. However, once the unauthorized flags were triggered, the system users (including those inside the official intelligence apparatus) needed to find another back-door to continue\u2026 Again, the timing becomes transparent.\n\nImmediately after NSA flags were raised March 9th; the same intelligence agencies began using confidential human sources (CHS\u2019s) to run into the Trump campaign. By activating intelligence assets like Joseph Mifsud and Stefan Halper the IC (CIA, FBI) and system users had now created an authorized way to continue the same political surveillance operations.\n\nWhen Donald Trump hired Paul Manafort on March 28, 2016, it was a perfect scenario for those doing the surveillance. Manafort was a known entity to the FBI and was previously under investigation. Paul Manafort\u2019s entry into the Trump orbit was perfect for Glenn Simpson to sell his prior research on Manafort as a Trump-Russia collusion script two weeks later.\n\nThe shift from \u201cunauthorized exploitation of the NSA database\u201d to legally authorized exploitation of the NSA database was now in place. This was how they continued the political surveillance. This is the confluence of events that originated \u201cspygate\u201d, or what officially blossomed into the FBI investigation known as \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d on July 31.\n\nIf the NSA flags were never raised; and if Director Rogers had never initiated the compliance audit; and if the political contractors were never blocked from access to the database; they would never have needed to create a legal back-door, a justification to retain the surveillance. The political operatives/contractors would have just continued the targeted metadata exploitation.\n\nOnce they created the surveillance door, Fusion-GPS was then needed to get the FBI known commodity of Chris Steele activated as a pipeline. Into that pipeline all system users pushed opposition research. However, one mistake from the NSA database extraction during an \u201cabout\u201d query shows up as a New Yorker named Michael Cohen in Prague.\n\nThat misinterpreted data from a FISA-702 \u201cabout query\u201d is then piped to Steele and turns up inside the dossier; it was the wrong Michael Cohen. It wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s lawyer, it was an art dealer from New York City with the same name; the same \u201cidentifier.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nI would strongly urge everyone to read the FISC report (full pdf below) because Judge Collyer outlines how the DOJ, which includes the FBI, had an \u201cinstitutional lack of candor\u201d in responses to the FISA court. In essence, the Obama administration was continually lying to the FISA court about their activity, and the rate of fourth amendment violations for illegal searches and seizures of U.S. persons\u2019 private information for multiple years.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that when democrats tried to force Barr into agreeing not to publish any reports by John Durham before the 2020 election, Barr simply stated \u201cno.\u201d", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/barr-drops-secondary-investigation-bomb-during-testimony/", "author": []}, {"title": "Savage Bill Barr Makes Democrats Look Like Ridiculous, Petty Idiots", "text": "Democrats seem to be going for a record in disastrous congressional hearings. During President Trump\u2019s remarkably effectively first term, they repeatedly showed themselves as deliberately biased, partisan hacks, according to a number of experts, and now they have done it again\u2026 this time against Bill Barr.\n\nDuring the congressional hearing yesterday, not only did Barr make democrat look like callous idiots, GOP members of the committee used their time to showcase the outrageous leftist support of riots and lawlessness.\n\nThe New York Post explained the lunacy and democrat embarrassment:\n\nTwo obstacles quickly became apparent. The first is that the Dems were led by Rep. Jerry Nadler, whose rabidness is exceeded only by his haplessness.\n\nThe start was delayed because Nadler was in a minor car accident. That was obviously an omen, but Nadler doesn\u2019t take hints, so he plowed forward into a head-on crash with a heavyweight opponent superior in \u00adevery way.\n\nNadler specializes in duds, demanding that former special counsel Robert Mueller testify a year ago, only to see the Russia, Russia, Russia hysteria collapse on national TV. Then Nadler, bearing a lifetime grudge against President Trump, did such a terrible job in the first impeachment hearings on Ukraine that Speaker Nancy Pelosi demoted him and turned the task over to Rep. Adam Schiff.\n\nYet Nadler is a slow learner and there he was Tuesday, opening the ballyhooed attack on the AG with a statement that was a farrago of lies, fake news and slanderous attacks on law enforcement, Barr and Trump. It was so over-the-top, so fact-free and unsupportable, that it had zero chance of setting the stage for a meaningful interrogation.\n\nThen again, honest interrogation was not the intent. Pelosi\u2019s House only does character \u00adassassination.\n\nRecently caught on camera calling Antifa violence in Portland a \u201cmyth,\u201d Nadler repeated the gist of that. He said Barr had \u201cendangered Americans and violated their constitutional rights by flooding federal law enforcement into the streets of American cities . . . to forcefully and unconstitutionally suppress dissent.\u201d\n\nSo hundreds of black-masked Antifa-types using guns, knifes, Molotov cocktails, commercial-grade fireworks, lasers and \u00adTasers to attack federal agents on federal property is now called \u201cdissent.\u201d Got it.\n\nAfter the GOP\u2019s Jim Jordan countered with an attack on the FBI\u2019s spying on Trump\u2019s campaign and played a video of pundits calling the violence in Portland and elsewhere \u201cpeaceful protests,\u201d the air had left the room before Barr said a word.\n\nWhen he got his chance, he didn\u2019t just defend his tenure \u2014 he went on offense to demand an end to the \u201cdemonizing of police\u201d and the dangerous defunding movement.\n\nThe war against law enforcement, he said, is making police \u201cmore risk-averse,\u201d and that is part of the reason crime is soaring across America \u2014 leading to the deaths of the very people the Black Lives Matter movement says it wants to help.\n\n\u201cThe leading cause of death for young black males is homicide,\u201d he said, adding that about 7,500 are murdered each year, 90 percent by other black Americans.\n\n\u201cEach of those lives matter,\u201d the attorney general declared.\n\nThankfully, somebody is not afraid the truth will get him canceled.\n\nIt was the first of many times Barr turned the tables on his would-be tormentors. He often appeared bored, but when he was allowed to speak, his words cut through the room like a knife. He called the attacks in Portland and elsewhere \u201can assault on the government of the United States.\u201d\n\nLater, he chided Nadler & Co. for their silence in the face of clear criminal activity.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in my memory that the leaders of one of our two great political parties, the Democratic Party, are not coming out and condemning mob violence,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t we just say the violence against the federal courts has to stop? Could we hear something like that?\u201d\n\nThe room was silent. The attorney general challenged their loyalty, and not a single Democrat objected. For them, it was just another day at the office.\n\nNearly every time I watch Barr in extended interviews or read one of his substantive speeches, I find myself saying, \u201cIf only.\u201d\n\nIf only Barr had been Trump\u2019s first attorney general, the last four years would have been dramatically different. Bob Mueller could have stayed in retirement because there was never real evidence of Russian collusion, not even enough, we now know, to start an FBI investigation.\n\nIt was all ginned up to thwart Trump during the campaign, and then upend his presidency. Yet because Trump picked Jeff Sessions to be AG, and because Sessions, in a supreme act of selfishness, took the job knowing he would recuse himself from overseeing the FBI probe, the nation got put through the wringer.\n\nDems were able to cow Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein into appointing Mueller and succeeded in putting the White House \u00adunder a cloud of suspicion for nearly three years. All those leaks and screaming headlines \u2014 they were all just a bunch of nothingburgers. Some were Pulitzer Prize-winning nothing\u00adburgers.\n\nThe entire episode, starring Jim Comey, James Clapper, John Brennan, Hillary Clinton and other unindicted co-conspirators of the Obama-Biden administration, was the dirtiest dirty trick in American political history. And although there was no collusion, Dems and much of the media have never let go of the red-baiting insinuation that Trump is a Russian agent and an illegitimate president.\n\nThe growing political violence, 99 percent of it from the far left, is a direct consequence, yet most Democrats don\u2019t dare denounce the insurrection. They save their condemnation for the federal officers who are under attack.\n\nAt one point Tuesday, Barr said flatly, \u201cWe have to take a stand.\u201d He was talking to Congress, but he meant all of us.\n\nHere are some of the best exchanges:\n\nBreitbart News reported:\n\nAttorney General William Barr said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday that left-wing groups like Antifa and Black Lives Matter have \u201chijacked legitimate protests\u201d over the death of a black man in police custody by rioting for two months in Portland, Oregon, attacking police and trying to destroy the federal courthouse and other federal property in the city.\n\n\u201cI want to address a different breakdown in the rule of law that we have witnessed over the past two months,\u201d Barr said. \u201cIn the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death, violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction on innocent victims.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current situation in Portland is a telling example,\u201d Barr said. \u201cEvery night for the past two months, a mob of hundreds of rioters has laid siege to the federal courthouse and other nearby federal property.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rioters have come equipped for a fight, armed with powerful slingshots, tasers, sledgehammers, saws, knives, rifles, and explosive devices. Inside the courthouse are a relatively small number of federal law enforcement personnel charged with a defensive mission: to protect the courthouse,\u201d Barr said.\n\n\u201cWhat unfolds nightly around the courthouse cannot reasonably be called a protest; it is, by any objective measure, an assault on the government of the United States,\u201d Barr said.\n\n\u201cEvery member of this committee, regardless of your political views or your feelings about the Trump administration should condemn violence against federal officers and the destruction of federal property,\u201d Barr said.\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Barr offered more details about the Portland riots.\n\n\u201cIn recent nights, rioters have barricaded the front door of the courthouse, pried plywood off the windows with crowbars, and thrown commercial-grade fireworks into the building in an apparent attempt to burn it down with federal personnel inside,\u201d Barr said.\n\n\u201cThe rioters have started fires outside the building, and then systematically attacked federal law enforcement officers who attempt to put them out \u2014 for example, by pelting the officers with rocks, frozen water bottles, cans of food, and balloons filled with fecal matter,\u201d Barr said. \u201cA recent video showed a mob enthusiastically beating a deputy U.S. marshal who was trying to protect the courthouse \u2014 a property of the United States government funded by this Congress \u2014 from further destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cA number of federal officers have been injured, including one severely burned by a mortar-style firework and three who have suffered serious eye injuries and may be permanently blind,\u201d Barr said.\n\nBreitbart also reported on Barr\u2019s condemnation of democrat appeasement to mobs:\n\nAttorney General William Barr called out Democrats on Tuesday during a House Judiciary Committee hearing for failing to condemn mob violence and attacks on the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse in Portland, Oregon in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cWhat makes me concerned for the country is [that] this is the first time in my memory that the leaders of one of our great two political parties, the Democratic Party, are not coming out and condemning mob violence and the attack on federal courts,\u201d Barr said.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just say: \u2018Violence against federal courts has to stop?\u2019 Could we hear something like that?\u201d\n\nBarr was testifying about the federal law enforcement response to protect the courthouse, which has been vandalized and firebombs by what Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, have called \u201cpeaceful protesters.\u201d\n\nThose \u201cprotesters\u201d have also attacked the federal officials defending the building.\n\nCommittee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), who claimed on Sunday that the violence was a \u201cmyth,\u201d did not respond by condemning the violence, but adjourned the hearing for a five-minute hearing instead.\n\nBarr was responding to questions from Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-AZ), who had also listed several examples in which Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) had denied that there had been a takeover in downtown Seattle (which later became the \u201cCapitol Hill Occupied Protest,\u201d or CHOP) and also denied that there had been violence in the \u201cautonomous\u201d zone.\n\nJayapal interjected to complain about the way Lesko had pronounced her name, but not to contest Lesko\u2019s summary of her views.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/savage-bill-barr-makes-democrats-look-like-ridiculous-petty-idiots/", "author": []}, {"title": "Soros Spends $52 Million To Control 2020 Election Cycle", "text": "Left-wing democrat billionaire George Soros, who as a teen collaborated with the Nazis (\u201cYou went and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews,\u201d the host said. \u201cYes,\u201d Mr Soros replied. \u201cWas it difficult?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d Mr Soros said. \u201cMaybe as a child you don\u2019t, you don\u2019t see the connection.\u201d \u201cNo feeling of guilt?\u201d \u201cNo. . . . 60 Minutes Interview, 1998), has spent over $52 million to influence the election cycle in the United States this year.\n\nThis amount does not include any donations made by his Open Society Foundations network or leftist organizers.\n\nMany people argue that the so-called \u2018movement\u2019 (which means riots, theft, and murder), is being financed by people like Soros as well, indicating that the election this year is the most important of our lifetime.\n\nBreitbart News reported:\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported on FEC filings from Soros\u2019s political action committee (PAC), Democracy PAC:\n\nSoros ramped up his political spending this cycle through the Democracy PAC, which he created last year to pump large sums into the coffers of other left-wing groups. New filings to the Federal Election Commission show the PAC doled out nearly $17 million last quarter, bringing its total cash disbursements this cycle to $48 million.

The $52 million cash influx is more than double Soros\u2019s previous high of $22 million, which came during the last presidential election.\n\nSoros\u2019s political spending captured by the FEC in 2020 is $30 more than it was in 2016.\n\nAccording to Open Secrets, Democracy PAC raised $51,635,003 in 2020, of which it has spent $48,091,590. Its beneficiaries are all left-wing and partisan Democrat PACs, including Senate Majority PAC, Priorities USA Action, Win Justice PAC, Illinois Justice & Public Safety PAC, Supermajority PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, and Pacronym.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon described the layers of PACs through which Soros\u2019s dollars travel before arriving at their end destination in order to obscure his role as a political benefactor:\n\nThe liberal billionaire is taking steps to obscure his election spending this cycle. In the past, he made donations to groups directly in his own name. This cycle, he has operated primarily by transferring tens of millions from the Fund for Policy Reform, a $750 million nonprofit in his sprawling Open Society Foundation network, into Democracy PAC. The PAC then disburses it to other Democratic PACs and committees. This arrangement allows Soros to keep his name from the top of donor lists.

The unions are behind these beliefs and yet teachers are too busy to notice. Teachers might think their union protects them, but when oppression ripens, no one is immune from its captivity. \u2013 Jinah Yi, Orange Unified School District parent, California.\n\nBrenda Lebsack has been a teacher in Orange County, California for over twenty-five years, and most recently a board member in the Orange Unified School District (OUSD).\n\nLebsack has been increasingly concerned about the progressive political creep into California education and as a member of the union has been very forward in voicing her opinion that the current political agenda in California schools is robbing students of a quality education.\n\nRecently Lebsack sounded the alarm in her school district after discovering and reviewing the proposed new Black Lives Matter (BLM) curriculum that is being floated as a part of the new school year. Says Lebsack in an exclusive statement to Redstate:\n\nThe National and state teachers union endorses Black Lives Matter and their K-12 curriculum. Within the BLM curriculum are teachings that Gender is the child\u2019s CHOICE based on the child\u2019s feelings. These choices encompass: Boy, Girl, Both, Neither or SOMETHING ELSE. (The CDE says this choice can be made as young as TWO).\n\nThe NEA partners with the Human Rights Campaign who has created preschool lessons teaching unlimited gender choices. The National Educators Association and ACSA (Administrators Calif School Association) recommend these \u201cwelcoming school\u201d lessons for our primary school children.\n\nParents and many school employees pushed back against the BLM insurgence in their own district last month when BLM organizations began issuing guidelines for new curriculums and included a push to completely defund police presence in LAUSD schools.\n\nHaving failed in Los Angeles (for now), BLM activists have been focusing on pushing their curriculum and political agenda into other districts. Last Thursday night, the Orange Unified School District held a meeting to discuss (among other agenda items) the plans for reopening campuses. A shockingly diverse and large group of parents logged into the virtual platform in force to express their concerns about the disturbing new curriculum incursions brought to their attention by Lebsack.\n\n*I am a Lesbian parent and grandparent...Please do not assume all LGBTQ individuals think alike politically. Just as teachers are very diverse in their opinions and political affiliations, so are people who identify as LGBT. As a Lesbian parent and grandparent, I am not in favor of Black Lives Matter Curriculum in Schools that the Teachers Union (CTA and NEA) endorses. First of all, BLM promotes gender ideologies I feel are harmful to children. Their mission statement says they want to DISMANTLE the idea that gender is biologically determined. WHY? They say their movement is based on SCIENCE, yet their Science says kids can CHOOSE their gender as boy, girl, BOTH, NEITHER or SOMETHING ELSE. SOMETHING ELSE?!? That\u2019s an OPEN ENDED Pandora Box. What kind of science does BLM practice? \u2013 Christina Gonzalez, OUSD parent, California\n\nThe NEA and the CTA have already given their stamp of approval to BLM curriculum resources. That means those resources will be added to the resource library of every district in the state, leaving the decision to teach the agenda up to individual schools and teachers. Not one parent or legislator voted on the appropriateness of the lessons, but simply by virtue of being available in the resource library, it is now a legal part of the California public education resource.\n\n* I am a concerned member of the community who is also African-American\u2026The last thing our children , from Kindergarten all the way to High School, need is to be feed any curriculum that seeks to indoctrinate and propagandize towards a Marxist/ultra progressive agenda. Our children need exposure to ideas that celebrate cultural diversity, community, care, forgiveness and free-thought.Our kids and their parents do not have a one size fits all life experience. Even among our families of color, political though and ideas are as diverse as their culture. I am afraid the very narrow focused BLM curriculum, will train our children to become radicalized and rob them of the ability to think for themselves and to have a more diverse, balanced and effective understanding of race, equality and social justice concerns. \u2013S. Turner, Orange County, California\n\nTeaching about equality and racial injustice seems benign and even necessary to the logical thinker. That is until one actually sees the approved BLM lesson guides as promoted by the NEA and CTA. Not only does the agenda include baldly communist talking points, it oddly includes the wedging in of gay and transgender centered curriculum and activism.\n\n*These concepts do not belong in the schools. Parents can teach their kids at home according to their family, cultural or religious values. The teachers union endorsement of BLM curriculum is an assault on parental rights and an assault on the fiber of our country \u2013 Gheorghe Rosca, OUSD parent, California\n\nA cursory perusal of the CTA\u2019s classroom resources yields so much heavy-handed BLM jargon that it is nearly impossible to isolate just one thing that could set parents on edge for the new school year. You can view their resources, talking points, and recommendations here.\n\nHere is one \u201ceducational\u201d graphic that defines white supremacy in its overt and covert forms.

How is this in the best interest of parents and families? The Teachers Union now endorses Black Lives Matter. Though it might sound great from the outside, that candy coating melts fast when you look inside. \u2013 Jade Ausmus, OUSD parent, California\n\nThe list goes on and on and feels more like a Marxist talking point list with every passing letter. The CTA page also provides a very helpful glossary of social justice terms (and redefine \u201cracism\u201d while they\u2019re at it) that teachers can use to help their classroom discussions.\n\nDecolonization: Work toward undoing, dismantling the effects of the oppressor/oppressed regime or structures imposed by a colonial power. For a classroom, this can mean unlearning and removing oppressive curriculum, language, images, norms, etc. (Sources 1\n\nRacism: A system (consisting of structures, policies, practices and norms) that structures opportunity and assigns value based on socially constructed categories of people. It unfairly disadvantages some individuals and communities and provides advantages and access to others. The system of racism does not allow the realization of one\u2019s full potential because it denies access to resources, power and privilege.\n\nWhiteness: Like race, whiteness is a social construct rather than an essential characteristic or biological fact; is used as cultural property, and provides resources, power and privilege to those who are considered white, pass as white, or are given \u201chonorary\u201d white status\n\nWhite Fragility: Describes the disbelieving defensiveness that white people exhibit when their ideas about race and racism are challenged\u2014and particularly when they feel implicated in white supremacy.

(Sources: 1 2)\n\nWhite Supremacy: A historically based, institutionally perpetuated system of exploitation and oppression of continents, nations and peoples of color by white people for the purpose of maintaining and defending a system of resources, power and privilege.\n\nPerhaps the biggest indictment against the Black Lives Matter curriculum incursion (outside of its unapologetic communist core) is the inclusion of LGBT issues that, in fact, are not embraced by the Black community in general, and no student group is off-limits.

He is sending federal troops to help stop the deaths.\n\nFox News reported:\n\nAs gun violence in Chicago increased exponentially over the past decade, African Americans were overwhelmingly impacted. Local leaders continue to grapple with how to combat the spike while opposing plans by the Trump administration to deploy federal agents to the city.\n\nFrom Jan. 1, 2010 through July 8 of this year, Black homicide victims accounted for 4,374 of the city\u2019s murders, according to figures provided by the Chicago Police Department to Fox News. The second-largest group impacted by gun violence \u2014 Hispanics and Black Hispanics \u2014 totaled 785 murder victims over the same period.\n\nThe murder rate of Black victims held steady, never surpassing 400 annually until 2016. That year, 607 Black people were killed, according to police. From Jan. 1 through July 8, the city reported 291 Black people killed.\n\nWhite people had significantly lower homicide numbers followed by people of Asian descent and Native Americans.\n\nWhile many cities saw their crime rates plummet in recent years, Chicago was making headlines for upticks in shootings and murders. On May 31, while most communities were steeped in protests over the killing of George Floyd, Chicago saw 85 people shot and 18 killed over a 24-hour period, according to the University of Chicago Crime Lab.\n\nThe figures made it the deadliest day in the city in six decades. The Crime Lab numbers only go as far back as 1961.\n\nGarry McCarthy, the former Chicago police superintendent who was fired in 2015, said he came to the job with a crime-fighting strategy similar to the one implemented by the New York Police Department, where he held executive positions.\n\nThe NYPD\u2019s tactics, some of which were highly controversial, contributed to major reductions in crime in the 1990s and 2000s, making New York one of America\u2019s safest cities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not heavy-handed policing, it\u2019s intelligent policing. It\u2019s about data-driven policing\u2026 knowing where to be to prevent the next shooting,\u201d McCarthy told Fox News.\n\nMcCarthy was appointed Chicago\u2019s top cop in 2011 and was fired in 2015 amid criticism over the shooting death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald at the hands of officer Jason Van Dyke. Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel credited McCarthy with driving crime down while noting he\u2019d lost the public trust.\n\nAccording to data provided by Chicago police, murders spiked significantly following McCarthy\u2019s exit, from 491 in 2015 to 778 in 2016. In 2017, the city reported 659 homicides and 577 in 2018.\n\nAs of July 8, Chicago experienced 364 murders this year.\n\nThe figures come during a nationwide reckoning over the role of police in society and how they treat people of color sparked by the May 25 death of Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers.\n\nSome progressive leaders and racial justice activists have called for defunding police departments so that law enforcement budgets can be diverted to community resources, housing and other social programs. Some cities have enacted legislation to limit police use of force and press for greater accountability of officers.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department did not respond to a Fox News request for comment about the uptick in murders and violent crime.\n\nChicago\u2019s murder rate and the increase in shootings are telling. As the overall crime rate decreased during stay-at-home orders to combat the coronavirus pandemic, shootings were still up in May and June. Shootings increased 71 percent in May and murders by 60 percent.\n\n\u201cThe narrative was, unlike many people who stayed at home, and because of that reduced the likelihood of victimization, people in those adversely impacted communities with respect to Covid and crime didn\u2019t necessarily change\u201d their behavior, David Olson, a professor of criminal justice and criminology at Loyola University Chicago, told Fox News.\n\nTio Hardiman, executive director of Violence Interrupters, a community-based organization focused on decreasing violent crimes in cities throughout the nation, said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the police data, and noted, \u201cit\u2019s been this way for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy theory is that it\u2019s a Black man\u2019s responsibility to reduce the gun violence in their communities,\u201d Hardiman, a Chicago resident who is Black, told Fox News. \u201cYou see, a lot of us continue to wait on the police to stop the killing. We continue to wait on programs to stop the killings. But it\u2019s really all about [how] the Black man must rise up to the occasion and really address the issue of gun violence in our community. The numbers will never surprise me.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the loss of one life is one too many.\n\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s a little something different in the air right now because it appears that there\u2019s no method to the madness that\u2019s going on across the nation, like in New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, a lot of different cities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on is that it\u2019s learned behavior. It\u2019s passed down from generation to generation \u2026 you have people out here now that are shooting just to shoot people. That\u2019s what makes it more dangerous.\u201d\n\nHardiman added that young Black men \u201care crying out for help now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the need for some sort of justice-type of programing here in the city of Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I would like to recommend for politicians and community thought leaders, to pretty much take a good look at restorative justice, because that might be the wave of the future when it comes down to really trying to reduce gun violence out here in major cities across the United States.\u201d\n\nTo combat the uptick in crime, President Trump said he will deploy federal agents to Chicago despite opposition from Mayor Lori Lightfoot and local leaders. The move is part of Operation Legend, which deploys federal forces to cities experiencing upticks in violence.\n\nSeveral groups have filed lawsuits to block federal intervention into matters they argue should be handled by local authorities. Agents are already placed in Portland, Ore., and Kanas City, Mo. In addition to Chicago, the Justice Department also added Albuquerque, N.M., to the list.\n\n\u201cThe effort to shut down police in their own communities has led to a shocking explosion of shootings, killing, violence, murders,\u201d Trump said of Chicago during a speech at the White House this week.\n\nIn a letter earlier this month, Trump blasted Lightfoot and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, accusing the Democratic leaders of putting their interests above public safety and likened the Chicago to the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cYour lack of leadership on this important issue continues to fail the people you have sworn to protect,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nLightfoot\u2019s office said she spoke with Trump following his announcement and made it clear that if there is any deviation from what has been announced, she will pursue all available legal options to protect Chicagoans.\n\nThe president\u2019s announcement came a day after gunfire erupted outside a funeral home in Chicago\u2019s Auburn Gresham neighborhood the left 15 people wounded.

The El Paso Times recently reported, \u201cConstruction of the border wall in the Chihuahuita neighborhood of Downtown El Paso continued Wednesday beneath the Stanton Street International Bridge. The U.S. Border Patrol announced Friday that the new wall would replace existing fencing south of Downtown El Paso and that construction would begin Saturday as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order authorizing construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall.\u201d\n\nLikewise, another $145 million (a very small price tag) has been paid to a contractor to begin construction of \u201csix miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the Rio Grande Valley. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said Friday that SLSCO will begin construction of an 18-foot reinforced concrete levee wall in February in the agency\u2019s McAllen Station region. The company will also increase the height of existing fences. It will be the first section of President Trump\u2019s border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings.\u201d\n\nTweet Number Four:\n\nWow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%.

Calls On Justice Dept. To Ground All \u201cTrojan\u201d Chinese Drones Monitoring Citizens", "text": "Last week, reports showed that many cities were using Chinese-made drones to monitor citizens\u2019 activity, and ensure that \u2018social distancing\u2019 orders were observed. Of course, the drones (discovered in 2017) are able to provide that information to \u201cterrorist organizations,\u201d infuriating a number of people, including Rep. Matt Gaetz.\n\nThe GOP Rep. called on the Justice Department and William Barr to order an immediate grounding of all such drones.\n\nJust the News reported:\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) is calling on Attorney General William Barr to order the grounding of all China-connected DJI drones used by law enforcement across the U.S. \u2013 including state and local agencies.\n\nDJI (D\u00e0-Ji\u0101ng Innovations) is a Chinese technology company that is suspected of using information from the drones used by U.S. law enforcement to feed sensitive data back to the Chinese government.\n\nIn 2017, the Department of Homeland Security released a report, in which they determined that DJI had specifically marketed their product to local law enforcement agencies, and as a result, China is able to \u201cprovide DJI information to terrorist organizations \u2026 to coordinate attacks against U.S. critical infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe findings of DHS\u2019s report prompted the U.S. Army and the Department of the Interior to end their use of DJI drones. However, law enforcement agencies across the country continue to use them, and several dozen local agencies recently accepted a donation of the drones from DJI, despite the national security risk they pose.\n\nOn a Fox News \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d appearance, Gaetz spoke about his letter sent Monday to Barr and called the DJI drones a \u201cTrojan horse spying operation in our country\u201d that local police departments may unwittingly be helping.\n\nWatch the Interview below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CmhHKvmyma4", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/gop-rep-calls-on-justice-dept-to-ground-all-trojan-chinese-drones-monitoring-citizens/", "author": []}, {"title": "GOP Governor Forced To Defend Adherence To U.S. Constitution", "text": "In what seems bizarre to many people, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem has been forced to defend her decision to adhere to the Constitution of the United States, rather than bow to media hysteria and revoke the inalienable rights granted by God to the citizens of her state.\n\nIn fact, many people argue that if these rights are not inviolate, and can be revoked at any time for a health \u2018crisis,\u2019 then the rights do not exist in the first place.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported:\n\nRepublican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem is one of a few state governors who have not yet placed citizens under a stay-at-home order in response to the current outbreak.\n\nNot only has she not placed the order, she has been outspoken in her contention that doing so would stand against everything America is supposed to stand for. She sees her decision as empowering individuals to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their families.\n\nShe is also taking an aggressive position on the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating the virus, placing her ahead of many other state governors.\n\nAs a result, on Monday, Governor Noem received about the highest praise any good American could when she was attacked in the pages of the Washington Post.\n\nThe Post used the occasion of an outbreak of the virus at South Dakota\u2019s Smithfield Foods, a pork producer located in Sioux Falls, as an opportunity to attack the governor\u2019s non-conformance. More than 300 workers at the facility have now tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus.\n\nFor anyone just learning of the story, that might give you pause to think that the governor should have locked down the state after all.\n\nThere are two problems with that conclusion. The first being South Dakota, a very rural state, has fewer than 1,000 reported cases of the virus (10th lowest in the nation), meaning the outbreak at Smithfield Foods accounts for nearly one-third of all statewide cases. The other problem, as was pointed out in The Federalist, is that since the pork plant is an \u201cessential industry,\u201d the workers would have been there even with a lockdown!\n\nOf the 988 cases reported in South Dakota as of this wiring, nearly 800 are reported in the county where the plant is located. This makes the South Dakota experience with the virus one of the most localized and minimized in the entire country. This is despite the fact that while much of the nation has been locked down for at least three weeks, South Dakota has remained open.\n\nGovernor Noem has been standing firm against the mob and their chosen talking heads on mainstream and social media, that have been demanding obedience to the collective \u201cwisdom\u201d of the collectivists, the \u201celites\u201d and the \u201cexperts.\u201d In a time when big government has taken control of almost everything (from fishing rights, to buying garden seeds, to traveling to a relative\u2019s home) in most places, Governor Noem has courageously looked the mob in the eye and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t like to hear \u201cno.\u201d They aren\u2019t used to hearing \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOne of the principal differences between Republicans and Democrats is supposed to be that Democrats favor government intervention in nearly every aspect of our lives, while Republicans almost universally say they prefer limited government and individual rights. They say that, but these past few weeks prove that only a few of them mean it.\n\nGovernor Noem means it and she isn\u2019t apologizing for it.\n\nThere is an important distinction to be made in my support of the governor over her refusals to lock down the state. I am not suggesting that no leader should have ordered any lockdown, for any period of time, anywhere in the country. What I am suggesting is that in the particular case of South Dakota there was and is no reason to order a lockdown.\n\nIf Governor Noem had caved in to the pressure of the national digital mob it would have been strictly for the purpose of saving face \u2014 for being liked. She could have done it to try and avoid criticism. To that point, I\u2019m sure the governor knows that you can\u2019t satisfy the insatiable. Most politicians, especially Republicans, cower when the media puts them in their crosshairs. Governor Noem is showing no such signs of cowardice. She is, seemingly, the rarest of all things in American politics \u2014 the real deal.\n\nI\u2019m sure the governor isn\u2019t doing any of this to receive national recognition, but thanks to the Washington Post and others, she\u2019s getting it anyway. What they undoubtedly intended as a hit piece, will be perceived by at least half of the country as a badge of honor. In fact, when her time as governor is concluded, should she give serious consideration to seeking higher office, I believe she would be rewarded for her bravery and dedication to the Constitution. I for one hope she does consider it.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reported:\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News, Noem defended her decisions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got one issue in a pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, but outside of that, two-thirds of our state has no cases or one case in an entire county. So we are doing very well as a state,\u201d Noem explained. \u201cWe are addressing the one hot spot that we do have and aggressively testing in that area, but what you talked about Laura is exactly right.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWe should be tracking who\u2019s in the hospital, what the death rate is, and South Dakotans are doing a fantastic job following my recommendations, and we\u2019ve been able to keep our businesses open and allow people to take on some personal responsibility.\u201d\n\nNoem addressed the outbreak at Smithfield Foods, a pork processing plant that was closed after an outbreak infected more than 200 employees. While many have blamed Noem\u2019s refusal to close the state for the outbreak, the governor noted that Smithfield would have been open either way because it is a vital part of the food chain that is responsible for 5% of the nation\u2019s pork supply.\n\n\u201cThis processing plant is critical infrastructure,\u201d Noem explained. \u201cRegardless of a shelter-in-place order or not, it would have been up and running because it\u2019s an important part of our nation\u2019s food supply. So that\u2019s what\u2019s been happening on the national level is they\u2019ve been not telling all the facts behind this. The people of South Dakota can be trusted to make good decisions. We have common sense.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThat\u2019s why people want to live here, and that\u2019s why I love living here.\u201d\n\nNoem noted that she does not believe it would be constitutional for her to close down the state. She explained, \u201cI took an oath when I was in Congress, obviously to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I believe in our freedoms and liberties.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen across the country is so many people give up their liberties for just a little bit of security. And they don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Noem said. \u201cIf a leader will take too much power in a time of crisis, that is how we lose our country. So I felt like I\u2019ve had to use every single opportunity to talk about why we slow things down. We make decisions based on science and facts and make sure that we are not letting emotion grab a hold of the situation.\u201d\n\nWell said, ma\u2019am.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/gop-governor-forced-to-defend-adherence-to-u-s-constitution/", "author": []}, {"title": "Ron Paul Makes Stock Market Predictions, Unavoidable Despite Denying Tariffs", "text": "During the lead up to the 2016 election, before traction was gained by much of anyone except Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY), the idea of sound money was on the lips of the GOP, at least at a grassroots level. Once Donald Trump\u2019s popularity rose, while he embraced a great many libertarian precepts, his stance on money is one that relies on a FIAT system that is going to destroy our economy no matter who is in office. Addressing this truth is long time libertarian icon, retired Texas legend, Ron Paul.\n\nPaul is the hero who may well be president even today (if he had won a second term) if he had not been cheated by his own party in 2012 (much like Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was during the last cycle by his party). He has, in the past, warned that some within the government may wish to kill Mr. Trump. Now Paul is now sounding a different bell again. According to CNBC, he says that the stock market is not in danger only due to \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threat.\u201d He warns that \u201cthis is going to be a calamity\u201d and the system has been \u201crigged.\u201d\n\nHere, we see that even Paul can be missing some of Trump\u2019s skill, though not in total. Protecting U.S. jobs is something that has to happen and these tariffs are very needed. However, to do so sans the gold standard is a death sentence, something that the retired Texan has long admitted.\n\nAs correctly as ever, Ron Paul said that our real problem \u201cstems from Federal Reserve policy and easy money,\u201d a fact that becomes clearer and clearer each year.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed continues on the things that they are sort of planning on doing, it\u2019s going to be a calamity,\u201d Paul warned on the show, Trading Nation. \u201cI think we have a greater distortion and a financial danger sitting out there bigger than ever before.\u201d\n\nForgetting that (while Mr. Trump is by far and away the best thing to happen to America in a generation) the president is wrong in many ways about FIAT currency is easy to do. However, the jubilance will fade when the economic prophecies of Ron Paul prove true, so it would be wise to address these concerns early on.\n\nThe Fed has made \u201ccritical errors\u201d and has \u201crigged the economy,\u201d the former Congressman warns. These woes \u201crange from keeping interest rates low for too long, the rounds of quantitative easing and timing of selling its financial-crisis era assets.\u201d Each problem listed in a guillotine blade looms over the heads of investors, and by proxy, the entire nation.\n\nThe ever-blooming budget deficit is also a problem that is not being addressed, according to Ron Paul. His son has also voiced the same concerns on a great number of occasions.\n\nThe elder Paul lamented, \u201cEverything is just very burdened with debt, and there\u2019s no stopping it.\u201d He says investors should in no way be shocked if the stock market loses 50% of it\u2019s worth, even.\n\nShowing how former President Obama and his bailouts only made things much worse, he also stated, \u201cThe correction is going to be huge, and I don\u2019t think anybody can predict. But I think this correction we had in \u201908 and \u201909 wasn\u2019t allowed to really go its course and restore some sensibility to the market. I think that\u2019ll be a mild correction to what could happen.\u201d\n\nThis means that, while Donald Trump is certainly proving to be a good president, there is an elephant in the Oval Office that is being ignored. As Mr. Paul reminds everyone, sooner or later, that elephant is going to become quite enraged and want to be fed.\n\nSources: The Conservative Daily Post \u2013 CNBC \u2013 Trading Nation", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/ron-paul-makes-stock-market-predictions-unavoidable-despite-denying-tariffs/", "author": ["Sam Di Gangi"]}, {"title": "Senator Sanders Cancels Interview, Journalist Wouldn\u2019t Agree Family Questions Off Limits", "text": "Just like almost any other progressive, one of the most notorious characteristics of Senator Bernie Sanders is the way he exposes his authoritarian essence in the most unexpected opportunities. This time, while everything happened out of cameras and through the comfortable effectiveness of his spokesman, Sanders showed once again that transparency is not exactly his most favorite word.\n\nBasically, he canceled an interview just because he didn\u2019t get to control the questions. Specifically, he couldn\u2019t control those regarding his family and his wife, who is facing a major scandal that the Vermont senator called a \u201cgossip.\u201d Lamentably for him, new reports informed there would be indictments on this matter.\n\nAccording to a Vermont-based paper, the socialist backed out of the interview after the news outlet announced that he couldn\u2019t make his family wife\u2019s controversy off-limit. Naturally, while Sanders had no problem in having the interview, this was an extremely important condition.\n\nAfter all, while he always loved to provide the image of an irreverent figure that doesn\u2019t comply with the bourgeoisie manners of the U.S. politics, Sanders proved to be worse than the kind of politicians he always despised.\n\nWhile his wife has been swimming in really hot water for several months, Sanders is not only using his influence to let her get away with murder, but also refusing to say anything regarding this problem.\n\nNaturally, while it\u2019s always quite ugly to see a politician canceling an interview because of these kinds of issues, it\u2019s always worse when the one who does it tends to glorify himself as someone who is above these political banalities.\n\nApparently, his spokesman Daniel McLean called the news outlet Seven Days on Sunday in order to offer the interview with the senator on Monday morning. At this point, it all seemed like the interview was almost good to go.\n\nHowever, things started to get ugly when the spokesman said the paper would not be allowed to ask anything related to his family, or what he described as \u201cpolitical gossip.\u201d Basically, it was like having the opportunity to interview George W. Bush and not being able to ask him about Iraq.\n\nLogically, the newspaper refused to accept this particular condition, considering that by accepting it they would be forced conduct just a shameful interview. In fact, the news outlet even noted that it has never accepted any kind of preconditions to political interviews.\n\nSoon after that, there was a particular moment when one reporter of this newspaper decided to confront the senator in person to ask for an interview. Believe it or not, Sanders made it perfectly clear that he would only accept an interview only if the newspaper accepted his terms.\n\n\u201cWell, as I think Dan indicated, we talk about issues. We don\u2019t talk about gossip,\u201d the senator said. Naturally, he tried to make the idea that his wife\u2019s controversy is nothing more than an irrelevant topic.\n\nAccording to The Washington Free Beacon, the alternative newspaper pointed out that Bernie Sanders\u2019 stepdaughter Carina Driscoll is now running for mayor of Burlington. In addition, it said that the senator\u2019s wife Jane Sanders has been under heavy scrutiny by federal investigators.\n\nAs everyone knows, Jane Sanders has been investigated for her infamous role in possible bank fraud. Apparently, this controversial case is connected to a land purchase she made while she was the president of the now-defunct Burlington College.\n\nEarlier this month, VTDigger reported that the investigation had expanded to a grand jury.

Especially when there\u2019s a presidential election in just two years.\n\nAccording to several reports, the Vermont senator could be once again one of the main candidates in the Democratic primaries in order to compete against President Donald Trump for turning the White House liberal again.\n\nWhile the Democratic Party hasn\u2019t provided any kind of comment regarding the presidential elections, almost every single analyst agree that Bernie Sanders could be the favorite to winning the primaries.\n\nBasically, there are two significant factors that are quite important to understand why this socialist could be the Democratic nominee in 2020.\n\nOn one hand, it is an undeniable fact that he remains as the most popular figure on the Democratic party since Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat in the 2016 presidential election against Donald Trump. In fact, almost every single poll confirms it.\n\nOn the other hand, he could easily exploit the victim card on its huge liberal base, considering the way the DNC rigged the primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton when they were competing for the nomination.\n\nNaturally, it\u2019s because of this reality that Sanders is avoiding any question related to his family and wife.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/senator-sanders-cancels-interview-journalist-wouldnt-agree-family-questions-off-limits/", "author": ["Luis Orozco"]}, {"title": "You\u2019re \u201cLucky I Don\u2019t Know How To Build A Bomb\u201d: Muslim Student Admits Trying to Kill Children At School", "text": "When many people think about terrorism, bombs are often where the mind goes. Not all terrorists use bombs or even have the skills to do so. In a recent court case against a terror suspect who set fires, the courtroom was stunned as the accused shared she was not successful in killing more simply because she did not know how to make bombs. She stated that the local community was \u201c\u2026lucky I don\u2019t know how to build a bomb.\u201d\n\nThe suspect is 19-year-old Muslim Tnuza Jamal Hassan. She was arrested on one count of arson tied to 8 fires set at the St. Paul campus of the St. Catherine\u2019s University. Hassan was enrolled at the college in the fall as a freshman but dropped out shortly after that. She was hoping to kill children at the school to gain national and possibly worldwide attention.\n\nWhen small fires started to break out all over the campus in Minneapolis, school officials did not have any idea why they were set. There was nothing to indicate these were tied to any particular terrorist group until the story about the suspect began to emerge. Hassan made no efforts to hide the fact this was an attack at the hands of jihad with the intent to kill as many people as possible.\n\nHassan shared that she set the fires to get revenge for school fires she read about online. She shared that she knew American troops were burning schools in Iraq and Afghanistan, so she felt like she should do the same thing here.\n\nBeyond sharing her reason for the fires, Hassan also shared that she was not happy with the outcomes of the fires. She set a series of 8 small fires and was disappointed that the fires did not kill anyone. It seems she set them to burn the school to the ground and kill as many as possible.\n\nAt one point during the arsons, Hassan targeted Saint Mary\u2019s Hall. This is a dorm that also houses a daycare. She was hoping to burn it down and kill both women and children to get more attention. At the time the fire was set there were 33 children and eight adults at risk.\n\nHassan not only started a fire in a bathroom within Saint Mary\u2019s Hall but also went on to set 7 more fires. The fires were spread out all over campus in the hopes that the sheer number of fires would leave personal pulled so thin they could not put them all out. Her careful planning was set into place to create chaos and try to keep starting more fires as campus workers worked to put the others out.\n\nAs each fire was set on campus, officials began to try to see a pattern. They quickly realized they were dealing with a significant threat and worked to stop the fire setting. Police looked at on-campus security cameras and found footage of Hassan setting the fires.\n\nHassan was arrested the afternoon of the fires in a dorm room. She was brought up on one count of arson even though they confirmed there were a total of 8 fires set. There is no explanation as to why she was only charged with setting one of the fires.\n\nDuring interviews with police, Hassan made it very clear she intended to kill strangers. She was not setting fires to do property damage; she was out for blood. There are many within the local community that want to know why she was not charged with attempted murder. When she set the fire at Saint Mary\u2019s Hall, she did so to kill as many of the 33 children and eight adults that were there as possible. It would seem logical to charge her with 41 counts of attempted murder as well. In all total, it appears that the suspect has walked away with a bare minimum of charges for a severe terrorist attack.\n\nFor those who are dismissing these fires as not being serious, something that the suspect said in court upon her first appearance may change that. It seems the young defendant was not overly sorry for her efforts, in fact very much the opposite. She expressed frustration that her efforts did not end in any deaths. She also shared that the campus was lucky that she did not know how to make bombs as she would have done so. The amateur fires set that day was not what she intended to do, but she did not have the needed skills to carry out a more massive scale attack alone.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/youre-lucky-dont-know-build-bomb-muslim-student-admits-trying-kill-children-school/", "author": ["April Horning"]}, {"title": "Trump Defies California, Causes Leftist Outrage By Providing Farmers With Water", "text": "President Trump\u2019s administration, thanks to scientists who understand facts, has reversed findings involving California\u2019s water. A decades old opinion concerning \u2018endangered species\u2019 has been changed, thanks to new data on various types of fish, allowing much needed water to the state\u2019s farmers.\n\nThe president signed an order on Wednesday to re-engineer the state\u2019s water plans, fulfilling a campaign promise to funnel water from northern areas to agriculture industries further south.\n\nNaturally, the move prompted outrage from the democrat controlled state, which would apparently rely on \u201coutdated\u201d opinions that protected a non-endangered fish over providing a much needed resource to human beings.\n\nThe Hill reported:\n\nTrump said the changes to the \u201coutdated scientific research and biological opinions\u201d would now help direct \u201cas much water as possible, which will be a magnificent amount, a massive amount of water for the use of California farmers and ranchers.\u201d\n\n\u201cA major obstacle to providing water for the region\u2019s farmers has now been totally eliminated by the federal government,\u201d Trump said Wednesday in Bakersfield, Calif., flanked by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), as well as Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who helped shepherd the changes to the state\u2019s water policy.\n\nTrump\u2019s order comes as the state has taken several steps to deal with the water scarcity that has lasted for decades.\n\n\u201cIt would be different if you had a drought,\u201d Trump claimed, despite concerns the state may be headed into another drought. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a drought.

In October of last year, Interior released a new biological opinion limiting the longtime protections for the fish.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s speech, Trump gave repeated kudos to Bernhardt, who has been mired in controversy for his past work for Westlands Water District, one of the groups pushing to expand water access for central California\u2019s ag industry.\n\nReporting from The New York Times found that Bernhardt continued to work for Westlands as late as April 2017, the month he was nominated to his previous role as deputy secretary of the department. He filed paperwork to end his status as a federal lobbyist in November 2016.\n\nInterior said Bernhardt had \u201cengaged in various legal services\u201d to support Westlands \u2014 but not lobbying.\n\nThe story spurred a call from Democratic lawmakers to investigate Bernhardt\u2019s lobbying work and in turn a commitment from Interior\u2019s Office of the Inspector General in April of last year to review seven complaints alleging conflicts of interest or potential ethics violations by Bernhardt.\n\nInterior said its decision to change protections for the fish was not tied to Bernhardt\u2019s past employer.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no connection,\u201d Paul Souza, a regional Fish and Wildlife Service official, said when the decision was rolled out, adding that he and the others who worked on the issue were \u201ccareer professionals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have led these efforts with our team over the past year and these are career professional documentation,\u201d he added.\n\nBut environmentalists have viewed the latest biological review with skepticism.\n\n\u2026\n\nTrump took various jabs at California\u2019s Democratic leadership, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, while lavishing praise on the Republican delegation members that were present.\n\n\u201cAfter decades of failure and delays in ensuring critical water access for the people of this state, we are determined to finally get your problem solved,\u201d Trump said, referring to the state\u2019s previous water policy as a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy also praised Trump for fulfilling his campaign promise to divert more water to farmers in California.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it great to have a president who understands farming is not easy?\u201d he said before the president came on stage. \u201cIsn\u2019t it great to have a president who keeps his promises?\u201d", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/trump-defies-california-causes-leftist-outrage-by-providing-farmers-with-water/", "author": []}, {"title": "Jordan, Meadows Moved To Top Positions On Key House Committees", "text": "Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows, both GOP Reps. are being moved to top positions within key House committees.\n\nJordan will take over the leadership of the Judiciary Committee, and Meadows on the House Oversight.

In that case, the appeals court said the crime occurred on land assigned to the tribe before Oklahoma became a state and Congress never clearly eliminated the Creek Nation reservation it created in 1866.\n\nThe case the justices decided Thursday involved 71-year-old Jimcy McGirt, who is serving a 500-year prison sentence for molesting a child. Oklahoma state courts rejected his argument that his case does not belong in Oklahoma courts and that federal prosecutors should instead handle his case.\n\nMcGirt could potentially be retried in federal court, as could Patrick Murphy, who was convicted of killing a fellow tribe member in 1999 and sentenced to death. But Murphy would not face the death penalty in federal court for a crime in which prosecutors said he mutilated the victim and left him to bleed to death on the side of a country road about 80 miles southeast of Tulsa.\n\nAtlanta Journal Constitution reported:\n\n\u201cOn the far end of the Trail of Tears was a promise. Forced to leave their ancestral lands in Georgia and Alabama, the Creek Nation received assurances that their new lands in the West would be secure forever. \u2026 Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law.

With the passage of time, Oklahoma and its Tribes have proven they can work successfully together as partners,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s three U.S. attorneys quickly released a joint statement expressing confidence that \u201ctribal, state, local and federal law enforcement will work together to continue providing exceptional public safety\u201d under the ruling.\n\nJonodev Chaudhuri, ambassador of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation and a former chief justice of the tribe\u2019s Supreme Court, said the state\u2019s argument that such a ruling would cause legal havoc in the state was overblown.\n\n\u201cAll the sky-is-falling narratives were dubious at best,\u201d Chaudhuri said. \u201cThis would only apply to a small subset of Native Americans committing crimes within the boundaries.\n\n\u201cThis case didn\u2019t change ownership of any land.

The sole reason, of course, was to beef up the numbers in democrat held territories, giving democrats more power in congress and more federal money to support the illegal alien population in their cities through \u2018social\u2019 services.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump just put a massive wet blanket on their plan.\n\nUsing the rouge court\u2019s support of Obama\u2019s illegal alien \u2018protection,\u2019 (DACA), the president has just signed an executive order that will prevent these unlawful residents from counting toward district remapping.\n\nFox News reported:\n\nPresident Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order to prevent illegal immigrants from being counted for the purposes of re-drawing congressional districts after the 2020 census \u2014 reheating a fiery debate from last year on if illegal immigrants should be counted in the census.\n\n\u201cThere used to be a time when you could proudly declare, \u2018I am a citizen of the United States.\u2019 But now, the radical left is trying to erase the existence of this concept and conceal the number of illegal aliens in our country,\u201d Trump said in a statement accompanying the apportionment memorandum on \u201cEnsuring American Citizens Receive Proper Representation in Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is all part of a broader left-wing effort to erode the rights of Americans citizens, and I will not stand for it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe order says that for the purposes of reapportionment, \u201cit is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status\u2026to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with the discretion delegated to the executive branch.\u201d\n\nCensus counts are used to determine the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives, the number of electors in the Electoral College and hundreds of billion dollars of federal spending. However, it is not clear how the administration would determine who was in the country illegally since the census currently does not either include a citizenship question, or the additional question about legal immigration status.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action to exclude illegal aliens from the apportionment base reflects a better understanding of the Constitution and is consistent with the principles of our representative democracy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy Administration will not support giving congressional representation to aliens who enter or remain in the country unlawfully, because doing so would create perverse incentives and undermine our system of government. Just as we do not give political power to people who are here temporarily, we should not give political power to people who should not be here at all.\u201d\n\nThe order, giving justification, says that the Constitution \u201cdoes not specifically define which persons must be included in the apportionment base.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough the Constitution requires the \u2018persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed,\u2019 to be enumerated in the census, that requirement has never been understood to include in the apportionment base every individual physically present within a State\u2019s boundaries at the time of the census,\u201d the order says.\n\n\u201cInstead, the term \u2018persons in each State\u2019 has been interpreted to mean that only the \u2018inhabitants\u2019 of each State should be included,\u201d it says. \u201cDetermining which persons should be considered \u2018inhabitants\u2019 for the purpose of apportionment requires the exercise of judgment.\u201d\n\nIt then says that that discretion \u201cdelegated to the executive branch to determine who qualifies as an \u2018inhabitant includes authority to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\u201d\n\nThe order cites estimates that \u201cone state\u201d (apparently referring to California) has more than 2.2. illegal immigrants, six percent of its population. It argues that, as a result, including illegal immigrants in the population for apportionment could result in the allocation of two or three more congressional seats than if they were not included.\n\nIt comes as part of an ongoing push by the Trump administration to make sure that illegal immigrants are not included in the census. The order will likely be subjected to a legal challenge from immigrant activist groups and others, with Democrats saying on Tuesday that they would oppose the order.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Supreme Court last year blocked a citizenship question from being included in the census and sent the question back to the lower courts after concluding the Trump administration\u2019s reasoning for including such a question was insufficient. It had been opposed from Democrats and immigrant groups on the basis that it could discourage immigrants from responding.\n\nTrump later signed an executive order to get an accurate count of citizens and non-citizens present in the country.\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr said at the time that the information collected via the executive order could be useful in determining the makeup of the Electoral College and congressional apportionment.\n\n\u201cThat information will be used for countless purposes. For example, there is a current dispute over whether illegal aliens can be included for apportionment purposes. \u2026 We will be studying this issue,\u201d Barr said.\n\nMany others are excited and thrilled to have a president who stands up for legal citizens and is fighting the illegal corruption that pervades the democrat party.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/trump-signs-order-preventing-illegals-from-being-counted-as-population-for-congressional-district/", "author": []}, {"title": "Women Arrested For Savage Beating Of Dem State Lawmaker", "text": "In Madison, violent and ignorant rioters claiming to protest \u2018racial injustice,\u2019 in June, savagely attacked and beat a democrat state senator who was filming the carnage.\n\nNow, two of those attackers have been arrested.\n\nJS Online reported:\n\nPeople in the crowd attacked state Democratic Sen.

Twelve people were arrested for mob action, damage to property and attacking police officers.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be a city that thinks mob action of a crowd is acceptable behavior,\u201d Brown said, noting that when chaotic protests occur, the department is forced to divert manpower from policing high-crime areas.\n\nThe city reported 63 people shot and 12 killed over another violent weekend.\n\nIn response to Friday\u2019s events, Brown said he\u2019s ordered all officers to wear \u201cany and all protective gear\u201d when policing demonstrations.\n\n\u201cWe cannot assume that protests are going to be peaceful, based on these actions and others,\u201d he said.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot said \u201cvigilantes\u201d attended Friday\u2019s protest with intentions of violently engaging with authorities.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not peaceful protest. That\u2019s anarchy,\u201d she said during a Monday groundbreaking of a restaurant. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a circumstance where a small subset of that try to take over and hijack the peaceful protest and then turn it into a fight with the police.\u201d\n\nShe also said she was not happy with images of injured protesters and reporters who were confronted by police officers.\n\nFriday\u2019s protest was organized by Indigenous people in Chicago to call for the removal of the Columbus statue. Similar confrontations between authorities and demonstrators over memorials and monuments of controversial figures have occurred nationwide.\n\nMiracle Boyd, an 18-year-old activist, said she lost some teeth after being punched by a police officer. Video of that incident was also circulating on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThere is no way I should have left a protest bruised and battered for exercising my freedom of speech and freedom to assemble,\u201d Boyd, an activist with GoodKids MadCity, said during a news briefing Monday morning. \u201cI am disgusted and never would have ever thought I would become a victim to the biggest gang in America.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the city\u2019s Civilian Office of Police Accountability said it received more than 20 complaints against police officers related to the protest.\n\nWatch the video below:", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/chicago-officers-ambushed-by-organized-mobs-democrat-militant-wing-beefs-up-attacks/", "author": []}, {"title": "TN Primary Heats Up: Name Calling And Attack Ads Just The Beginning", "text": "Last week, I got a call from a stranger asking me what I knew about Dr. Manny Sethi, one of the candidates running for the vacant seat in the Senate. The seat was previously held by career politician and notorious gang of eight RINO Lamar Alexander.\n\nAnd, yesterday, I got a spam text telling me that Manny Sethi couldn\u2019t be trusted by Trump conservatives. So, the race is definitely heating up.\n\nI explained to the caller last week that I don\u2019t have television, but that my husband and I were starting to research the candidates for the primary coming up in about two weeks.\n\nIn fact, although I\u2019m not being brainwashed by the boob-tube\u2026 like many Tennesseans, I\u2019m extremely informed not only about the present, but also about American history and the pivotal role this state has played throughout the nation\u2019s past.\n\nFor example (I\u2019ll make it brief) Tennessee statesmen crafted the method still used today for a state\u2019s inclusion in the union; We\u2019ve sent three presidents to the White House; a republican from Tennessee cast the deciding vote for women\u2019s suffrage; oh yeah, and thanks to Tennessee, Al Gore didn\u2019t get elected president in 2000\u2026 by not carrying his home state, the race in Florida with the \u201changing chads\u201d wouldn\u2019t have mattered.\n\nSide Rant: Incidentally, if you do want to relocate to a land that is beautiful, has four real seasons and is still relatively free, where you can raise your children with the convictions of morality in peace (I\u2019m talking about everywhere but Memphis and Nashville), come on down! You\u2019re welcome!\n\nHowever, if you move here thinking to bring your dipshit-liberal, ass hat ideas here and \u2018educate\u2019 us ignorant hillbillies\u2026 just take yourself off to some other hell hole like the one you\u2019re trying to escape and spread your \u2018enlightenment\u2019 there.\n\nSo, after explaining these things to the caller, who I learned was a recent \u2018transplant\u2019 to our fine state\u2026 he started talking about Dr. Manny.\n\nEverything I heard sounded good. Mask mandates, wrong and stupid. Socialized state healthcare, idiotic. Electoral college, crucial for the existence of the Republic.\n\nRecently, Tennesseans have been betrayed by our Senate picks. I\u2019m not talking about Marsha Blackburn, she\u2019s doing okay. I\u2019m talking about Bob \u2018turncoat\u2019 Corker and Lamar \u2018career politician\u2019 Alexander (he betrayed the state repeatedly over the last four years). And of course, there\u2019s also Bill Lee who has stabbed us all in the back with his leftist leanings.\n\nDr. Manny is an outsider\u2026 Bill Hagerty was hand-picked by the establishment to replace Alexander.\n\nAnd, apparently that fact has Hagarty running scared.\n\nThe Tennessee Star reported:\n\nU.S. Senate candidate Manny Sethi released a statewide ad Thursday criticizing his opponent in the Republican primary, Bill Hagerty, for past connections to Mitt Romney and Al Gore.\n\nThis, according to a press release that Sethi\u2019s campaign emailed Thursday.\n\nSethi\u2019s campaign titled the ad \u201cRomney, Gore, and Common Core.\u201d\n\nIn the press release, Sethi Campaign Chair Chris Devaney said the ad highlights important differences between the two candidates.\n\n\u201cBill Hagerty is attacking Dr. Manny Sethi for giving $50 to a family friend,\u201d Devaney said.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile Hagerty gave $100,000 to Mitt Romney, donated to Al Gore, and Hagerty\u2019s company made millions off Common Core. Hagerty is desperate and scared. He should be\u2014Manny Sethi is winning.\u201d\n\nSethi, in the ad, asks \u201cwhy is the establishment attacking a nice guy like me?\u201d\n\nHagerty campaign spokeswoman Abigail Sigler addressed the ad in an email Thursday. The Tennessee Star specifically asked Sigler about Sethi\u2019s claim that Hagerty made millions of dollars off Common Core and whether it was true.\n\n\u201cOf course, Bill worked to defeat Barack Obama in 2012, unlike Massachusetts Manny Sethi who applied to be in the Obama Biden White House. Manny Sethi\u2019s Never Trumpers have been attacking Bill since the day President Trump endorsed and announced his run for Senate,\u201d Sigler said.\n\n[Yet, Hagerty worked with the Clinton administration. And, the \u2018application\u2019 she\u2019s talking about was not a partisan appointment.]\n\n\u201cPresident Trump looked at all the candidates in this race, and he endorsed Bill because he trusts Bill to stand with him to protect conservative values, get our economy going again, hold China accountable, and stand up for life.\u201d\n\nIn 2009 members of the Obama White House announced on their website that Sethi was one of many national finalists for the 2009-2010 class of White House fellows.\n\nSethi Campaign Manager Forrest Barnwell-Hagemeyer emailed The Star Thursday and offered the following statement:\n\n\u201cHagerty was appointed to the President\u2019s Commission on White House Fellowships by Bill Clinton and re-appointed by Obama. Manny applied for a non-partisan academic fellowship from the Commission, while Hagerty was still on the Commission. Now, Hagerty is attacking Manny for applying to be a part of a group of which Hagerty was a member,\u201d Barnwell-Hagemeyer said adding \u201cit\u2019s all a smokescreen.\u201d\n\nAs The Star reported this month, Hagerty donated $1,000 each to the presidential campaigns of both Al Gore and George W. Bush in the year 2000, according to Federal Election Commission filings. That year Hagerty, according to his LinkedIn page, worked at the private equity investment firm Hagerty Peterson & Company LLC in Nashville, a position he held until July 2017. Hagerty said on his LinkedIn page that he co-founded the company.\n\nSo, we see the mud-slinging has begun.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m leaning toward Dr. Manny. He\u2019s a first generation American and the momentum behind his campaign is growing\u2026 where it counts. Among voters like me who are sprinkled throughout the state and who have a vested interest in keeping Tennessee a beacon of beauty and liberty.\n\nThe real indicator is where the money is coming from\u2026 who\u2019s donating to whose campaign. Hagerty is getting lots of cash from the establishment and is working with Trump\u2019s endorsement.\n\nBut, the bottom line is\u2026 the Senate position MUST be secured by a real conservative. If we aren\u2019t together in this\u2026 liberals will tear the house down and destroy the peace we are clinging to by a thread.", "link": "https://conservativedailypost.com/tn-primary-heats-up-name-calling-and-attack-ads-just-the-beginning/", "author": []}, {"title": "\u201cJesus Matters\u201d Preacher Arrested For Damaging BLM Street Painting", "text": "Bevelyn Beatty made headlines a few weeks ago by speaking with white liberals in Seattle, and now, she has gone viral by painting over the Black Lives Matter street murals.\n\nFox News reported:\n\nA Black woman opposing the Black Lives Matter movement, who was arrested Saturday for dumping paint on a BLM street mural outside Trump Tower, livestreamed herself doing the same thing again at similar murals in Harlem and Brooklyn later that evening.\n\nBevelyn Beatty, 29, livestreamed each installment on her Facebook page.

Now it's 'impossible to predict' how long the pandemic will last, Fauci says", "text": "(CNN) Without a national effort to adhere to preventative measures, the nation's top infectious disease doctor said, it will be impossible to predict how much longer the Covid-19 pandemic will last in the United States.\n\nThe US is seeing a resurgence of coronavirus infections after states began reopening their economies, with the number of cases now at more than 4.4 million and the death toll at 152,070, according to data from Johns Hopkins University . The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation increased its forecast to 219,864 total deaths by November, in part because the nation continues to debate measures like wearing masks and social distancing.\n\n\"The thing we need to do is we need to pull out all the stops to get it down to baseline and to keep it there by doing the things that we've been talking about -- that I've been talking about -- consistently,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday during CNN's coronavirus town hall.\n\nRegularly taking such precautions is especially important given that a backlog in getting test results is rendering some coronavirus testing practically useless.\n\n\"It shouldn't be acceptable\" that US testing is so backlogged, assistant Secretary for Health at the US Department of Health and Human Services Adm. Brett Giroir said Thursday.\n\nWhile he said about 25% of tests give results in about 15 minutes, most take days. Giroir said his goal is for all tests to be \"sensitive and specific and back within 15 minutes.\"\n\nBut, he said, \"you can't test your way out of this,\" and people should wear masks, avoid crowds and avoid being indoors with others.\n\nAdded Fauci: \"If we do that, then I think we will be well toward seeing this under control. If we don't, then we can't make a prediction about how long this will last.\"\n\nUncertainty around rapidly developing vaccine\n\nMeantime, the race is on for a vaccine to protect against coronavirus, and though some early data looks promising there are still questions around vaccines in development.\n\nOperation Warp Speed, the federal government's multi-billion dollar Covid-19 vaccine program, has provided funding for two potential vaccines that have quickly made their way to advanced human trial phases.\n\nThe head of the operation, Moncef Slaoui, said Thursday he wouldn't be surprised if a vaccine turned out to be 90% effective against the virus, but Fauci said only time will tell.\n\n\"We will hope its going to be that way,\" Fauci said. \"As we've said all the time, you just never can tell. The proof of the pudding is to do the clinical trial and get the result and that's actually what we're doing.\"\n\nBut people will need to get the vaccine in order for it to protect them, and even those who aren't deterred by existing conspiracy theories around vaccines could be scared off even by the project's name, Bill Gates said Thursday.\n\n\"We certainly need people to be rational about vaccines. They eradicated smallpox, they saved millions and millions of lives,\" he said. \"They are very complex to design, and that's why, you know, saying it's being done at Warp Speed is a little scary, because you really need to do the safety checks very, very carefully,\" said the founder of Microsoft and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nGates said the public should take comfort that the nonpolitical staff at the Food and Drug Administration are holding the line to ensure the rapidly developing drugs are effective and safe.\n\nPlans put into action as first day of school nears\n\nAs the start of the school year grows closer, officials are tasked with balancing public concern over children's safety with the impact virtual learning could have on their education and welfare.\n\nIn New York City, students will return to school with safety protocols for cleaning, contact tracing and distancing, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday.\n\n\"We are doing everything in our power to keep kids healthy while ensuring they are getting the education they deserve. These rigorous test and trace protocols will keep our students and staff safe as we start off this new school year,\" de Blasio said.\n\nPhiladelphia originally was going to return to a school year that combined virtual and in-person learning, but after backlash the Board of Education voted to provide all remote learning until at least November, with Superintendent Dr. William Hite promising that the change will not remove the emphasis on student achievement.\n\nDistricts in Florida are still weighing their options, but Gov. Ron DeSantis is advocating for a model based on parents' choice.\n\n\"I believe that there should be a choice for parents throughout Florida,\" DeSantis said.\"Parents who prefer distance learning should be able to opt for it, and parents who desire in person instruction should have access to it.\"\n\nStates try to turn trends downward\n\nAs parents and school districts weigh their choices, state officials are strategizing how to reverse climbing infection numbers.\n\nTexas researchers estimated Thursday that just two weeks of social distancing policies cut the spread of coronavirus by 65%, while states that have resisted those policies saw almost no reduction.\n\nIllinois could be reversing its reopening plan and heading back toward social distancing policies if the number of positive cases continue to climb, said Governor J.B. Pritzker during a news conference on Thursday.\n\nArizona is a state \"headed in the right direction\" with a downward trend since early July, Gov. Doug Ducey said Thursday.\n\n\"This is not a victory lap. This is not a celebration. If anything, it's evidence that the decisions, and the sacrifice that Arizonans are making are working,\" Ducey said.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/31/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html", "author": ["Madeline Holcombe"]}, {"title": "\u2018George Floyd All Over Again\u2019: ICE Guard Drove Knee Into Detainee", "text": "An Immigration and Customs Enforcement guard at an immigration jail in Virginia knelt dangerously on the upper back of a man already bleeding from his head, two detained men who said they saw the disturbing incident told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIt was like seeing George Floyd all over again,\u201d said one detainee, whom The Daily Beast will call Glenn.\n\nSince the incident on Monday, July 13, the detained men said that they have not seen the beaten man, identified as 31-year old Carlos Rivas Monsano. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t know where he is,\u201d a second detainee, whom The Daily Beast will call Jerry, said on Monday. A third detainee gave a similar account.\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Beast, ICE said it was investigating what is said to have happened to Rivas.\n\n\u201cU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reviewing the incident. ICE takes very seriously, allegations of misconduct in our detention facilities. We hold our personnel and contractors to the highest standards of professional and ethical behavior,\u201d an ICE spokesperson said. \u201cWhen we receive a complaint, we investigate the matter thoroughly to determine its veracity and to ensure that the comprehensive standards, which ICE is required to follow under various national detention standards, are being strictly maintained.\u201d\n\nThe violent episode occurred at ICE\u2019s Caroline detention facility, a 336-bed correctional center located on but independent of the Army\u2019s Fort AP Hill base near Bowling Green, Virginia. Not far from Caroline is another ICE prison that has suffered both a COVID-19 outbreak and several recent incidents of guard violence. That prison, ICA Farmville, has occasionally transited detained people through Caroline, prompting detainee concerns about the coronavirus that are said to have sparked what happened to Rivas.\n\nBeginning around 8pm on July 13, ICE officials informed around 25 individuals held in Caroline\u2019s Block\u2014called \u201cTE,\u201d short for \u201cTimber Ridge East\u201d\u2014that a quarantine was forthcoming. All three detainees told The Daily Beast there had been widespread dissatisfaction in Block TE about what they considered insufficient information provided about ICE measures to prevent the spread of the virus inside. Concerns on the evening of July 13 included whether Block TE would quarantine together; whether detainees would receive personal protective equipment like masks; and the distribution of bleach and other cleansing products to disinfect bathrooms.\n\nBut detainees appeared to ignore or dismiss the quarantine announcement by a female officer, who summoned her superior, whom the detainees described as possessing an intimidating demeanor. The superior officer, said to be a lieutenant called a meeting in a first-floor common area and instructed Block TE detainees to listen to the female officer.\n\nRivas, seated on a chair, loudly yelled \u201cNo\u201d before adding, in Glenn\u2019s paraphrase, \u201cWe're tired of all the politics that happen here, it\u2019s bullshit.\u201d\n\nThe lieutenant approached Rivas and informed him he would be handcuffed for that outburst. Rivas refused an order to stand but did not otherwise physically resist. The lieutenant, described as much larger than the slight Rivas, picked Rivas up and threw him to the floor. On the way down, Rivas\u2019 head slammed against the wall and began bleeding.\n\nJerry, who said he was seated five feet away from Rivas, said, \u201cit was like they hugged him and then threw him to the ground.\u201d\n\nWith Rivas bleeding from his head on the ground, Glenn and Jerry said, the lieutenant knelt on Rivas\u2019 upper back. A third account differed slightly. One detainee, whom The Daily Beast will call Doyle, said another guard knelt on Rivas\u2019 head while the lieutenant sat on Rivas\u2019 back in a straddle position. Neither Glenn nor Jerry\u2019s account included that.\n\nAll three detainees\u2019 accounts said the lieutenant lifted Rivas\u2019 right arm skyward in what appeared to be a painful contortion. With his free hand, he punched Rivas in the face multiple times, accelerating Rivas\u2019 bleeding from his head. Another guard, all three said, grabbed Rivas\u2019 legs at the ankles while Rivas yelled \u201cHe\u2019s hitting me!\u201d\n\n\u201c With his free hand, the lieutenant punched Rivas in the face multiple times, accelerating Rivas\u2019 bleeding from his head. Another guard grabbed Rivas\u2019 legs at the ankles while Rivas yelled, \u2018He\u2019s hitting me!\u2019 \u201d\n\nUnlike George Floyd\u2019s May 25 slaying by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, Rivas did not lose consciousness. The longest any detainee said the lieutenant knelt on Rivas\u2019 back was four minutes, less than half of the eight minutes and 48 seconds Chauvin knelt on Floyd\u2019s head.\n\nBut the lieutenant \u201cwas on top of him like the police officer was on top of George Floyd. His knee is on Carlos\u2019 spinal cord,\u201d Glenn said. Horrified Block TE residents screamed for the guards to let Rivas go and get him help.\n\nInstead, a rush of guards entered the room and formed a line separating them from their colleagues restraining Rivas. All three detainees said they were armed with pepper spray but did not use it on the detainees.\n\nGuards picked the bleeding Rivas off the floor and carried him out of the first-floor room. Bloodstains were said to be visible on the ground outside Rivas\u2019 room # 14. Detainees were told to return to their rooms, where other guards interviewed them about what they saw. Glenn opted for silence. \u201cThey manipulate everything you say,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to all three, approximately seven of the 25 witnesses were sent to The Hole, or solitary confinement. The detainees understood that to be witness intimidation.\n\n\u201c Approximately seven of the 25 witnesses were sent to The Hole, or solitary confinement. The detainees understood that to be witness intimidation. \u201d\n\nRumors abound about what happened to Rivas. Some said they believed he was taken to the infirmary or a nearby hospital. It is unclear if he has legal representation. All three said they had not seen or heard from him since the July 13 incident.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t need that level of force,\u201d said Jerry, who put what happened to Rivas in the context of dorm-wide fright about coronavirus.\n\nA captain returned to the scene with a doctor, Jerry said, \u201cand the doctor gave us the response we were looking for. The doctor said \u2018we\u2019re putting you in quarantine, we\u2019re not saying you have to leave your unit.\u2019 Put your mask on and maintain a distance of six feet from one person to the other.

Presidential candidates typically spend the final months of an election anxiously shoveling money toward state parties to fund get-out-the-vote operations and other critical infrastructure, but Democrats are running ahead of schedule this year.\n\nThat is largely thanks to donors across the country who are newly interested in funding the party\u2019s grassroots operations as a way to combat President Donald Trump, as well as state party leaders who have stepped up efforts to attract top donors with the promise of getting the most bang for their buck.\n\n\"A lot of donors are looking for the \u2018Moneyball\u2019 opportunity, where a dollar has the greatest possible impact,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman, citing Michael Lewis\u2019 book about the Oakland Athletics\u2019 pioneering data-driven approach to baseball, a style that state parties are now trying to mimic with their own pitches to top donors. \u201cState parties may not seem sexy, but when you dig into the numbers, then they have tremendous math appeal.\u201d\n\nSome of the top givers in the Democratic Party \u2014 people known for writing six- or seven-figure super PAC checks \u2014 have turned state parties\u2019 donor rolls into who\u2019s-who lists of mega-givers from New York to California. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Eric Schmidt, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and investor Jonathan Soros were among those donating directly to multiple state Democratic Party organizations well ahead of the 2020 election \u2014 which they did not do ahead of 2016 or 2012, federal filings show.\n\n\u201cThere is a much more strategic giving regimen this cycle,\u201d said Tim Lim, a Democratic digital consultant. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing recognition that the state parties have a fundamental role to play \u2026 and all those donor advisers, donor tables talk to each other about what they\u2019re doing and how best to spend their money.\u201d\n\nState parties appear to be benefiting in part from an improved relationship with the Democratic National Committee leading up to this election and, now, a nominee who is more invested in the party apparatus than President Barack Obama was.\n\n\u201cFor a long time, state parties were ignored during Obama\u2019s presidency and they were incredibly weak,\u201d said former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who chaired the DNC from 2005 to 2009, and described the shift of focus from the DNC and state parties to Organizing for America, the Obama campaign apparatus. \u201cNow, they\u2019re not [weak], which is a combination of increased competency among state parties and a donor base that\u2019s outraged by Trump.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have also been building a strong in-state party structure for several years, investing in organizing in particular, with over 1,500 staffers on the ground in 23 targeted states. They\u2019ve maintained more stable data-sharing relationships in recent years, an issue which has at times proven challenging for Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe RNC has consistently invested resources in building a strong state party system as we know it is vitally important to build the Party for years to come where we are the strongest \u2013 our grassroots and infrastructure,\u201d Mandi Merritt, the RNC\u2019s national press secretary, said in a statement.\n\nNow, the growing strength of Democrats' state party infrastructure is proving especially helpful to Biden, who largely struggled to raise money until he charged into the lead for the Democratic nomination in March.\n\n\u201cThey came out of the primary probably with the smallest footprint of any modern-day presidential nominee,\u201d said Ken Martin, the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party chairman and president of the Association of State Democratic Committees. \u201cIn terms of the size and scope of the campaign, it was a very small effort, as you know. In some ways, the Biden campaign really needed to lean into the DNC and into state parties, because they needed infrastructure, and they needed it fast.\u201d\n\nA cash injection\n\nDuring the entire 2016 election cycle, the 15 state Democratic parties tracked by POLITICO raised $74.3 million in federal contributions \u2014 but the vast majority of that money was doled out by centralized joint fundraising committees like Hillary Victory Fund, which allowed wealthy donors to write six-figure checks and then directed the proceeds to the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and other groups. Individual donors acting on their own gave $13.1 million to those 15 state parties, according to FEC records.\n\nBut in 2019 and 2020, Democratic donors acting outside the party\u2019s joint fundraising committees have already surpassed the mark from four years ago, giving $17.7 million directly to those state party organizations with three months to go until the election. Biden\u2019s joint fundraising efforts will pile on top of that in the coming months.\n\n\u201cA lot of big donors for years have invested in independent-side work and are starting to come to the realization that building out the infrastructure on the [party] side is just as important,\u201d Martin said.\n\nOne donor adviser, granted anonymity to discuss fundraising discussions candidly, said it\u2019s the \u201cpower of the pitch\u201d from state parties that\u2019s changed the dynamic, convincing big donors that their maximum $10,000 federal contributions to state parties could be more valuable than writing a bigger check to a super PAC. (Some states also have higher limits on state-level donations, or no limits at all.)\n\nSome of those early pitches came from Kimberly Reynolds, who served as the North Carolina Democratic Party executive director from 2015 to early 2019. Over the phone and in conference rooms in Washington, D.C., Reynolds sold donors on her party\u2019s efforts to \u201cBreak the Majority\u201d \u2014 ending the North Carolina GOP\u2019s legislative supermajority in the legislature and educating donors on the state party\u2019s role in bench-building and field operations.\n\nReynolds\u2019 efforts paid off in record funds and, ultimately, a campaign that cracked the GOP\u2019s hold on the legislature. And she and other state party executive directors have shared their best practices with each other.\n\n\u201cEvery discussion I have with donors focuses on what the party, and only the party, can do \u2014 building volunteer infrastructure, protecting the vote and doing year-round coalition building,\u201d said Juan Pe\u00f1alosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party. \u201cBecause, if the state party doesn\u2019t have the resources to do that work, our candidates begin the race three feet behind the starting line.\u201d\n\nRunning mate rundown: Click to see Biden's top picks for the VP spot in our new tracker. | Illustration by Megan McCrink/POLITICO\n\nIn 2019, state Democratic Party officials often pointed to their successes in the midterm elections \u2014 and likely difficult elections after 2020 \u2014 as reasons to invest. And in Wisconsin, Democrats could also point to their coordinated victory in a state Supreme Court race earlier this year, an all-in approach to mail-in balloting that pulled out a surprise victory for Democrats. State parties can be the hub for the \u201ccoordinated campaign,\u201d connecting candidates up and down the ballot to resources like data-rich voter files and get-out-the-vote field operations.\n\n\u201cLook, we have to hustle to make our case,\u201d said Jason Henry, executive director of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. \u201cAnd donors want to make smart investments.\u201d Following the midterm elections, he said, \u201cOur track record is really what we push on a lot of [donors].\u201d\n\nScott Hogan, the Georgia Democratic Party executive director, noted that \u201cthere\u2019s more money in the system, which helps all across the board, including state parties,\u201d citing record fundraising among Democratic candidates this cycle, but the party is \u201cthe sustaining organization.\u201d\n\nThe top expenditure line for most state parties is staff. The Georgia Democratic Party grew its paid staff from four in 2019 to 120 this month. In Florida, they had 30 to 40 staffers ahead of the convention in 2016, but now, they\u2019re topping out at over 200. And in Wisconsin, staffers and volunteers knocked on twice as many doors during the 2018 cycle than during the 2016 presidential cycle.\n\n\u201cThe one difference between our field programs in 2010 and 2014, [when we lost], compared to 2018 and 2020 is money,\u201d said Felecia Rotellini, the Arizona Democratic Party chair, citing the party\u2019s congressional and Senate victories in 2018. \u201cI think donors were more comfortable giving to candidates because they knew what they were paying for, like commercials or field organizing, so we have to explain that it\u2019s a one-stop shop with the state party.\u201d", "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/30/dems-pour-record-cash-into-battleground-state-parties-389082", "author": []}, {"title": "Republicans and White House at Odds Over Kansas Senate Race", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the Kansas Senate primary barrels to a close, tensions are rising between Senate Republicans and the White House over the potential nomination of Kris Kobach, who party officials fear would jeopardize the seat and further imperil their Senate majority.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell is worried that Mr. Kobach, the controversial former Kansas secretary of state who lost the 2018 governor\u2019s race, may win the nomination in Tuesday\u2019s primary, only to lose the seat in November \u2014 and he is frustrated that President Trump is not intervening in the race, according to multiple G.O.P. officials.\n\nMr. McConnell and other Senate Republican leaders have made urgent pleas to the president to block Mr. Kobach by endorsing one of his opponents, Representative Roger Marshall.

Earlier this month, DHS personnel were authorized to collect information on protesters who threaten to damage or destroy public memorials and statues, regardless of whether they are on federal property, a significant expansion of authorities that have historically been used to protect landmarks from terrorist attacks, former officials said.\n\nThe intelligence reports about the journalists say they are \u201cprovided for intelligence and lead purposes\u201d and have \u201cbeen deemed necessary for the intended recipient to understand, assess, or act on the information provided.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne of the journalists, Times reporter Mike Baker, co-wrote an article on July 28 that revealed an internal DHS memo indicating that the camouflaged federal agents sent to put down the unrest in Portland didn\u2019t understand the nature of the protests they were facing.\n\nAD\n\nThe DHS memo described the conflict as connected to a years-long history of violence against government personnel and facilities in the Pacific Northwest by \u201canarchist extremists.\u201d But it acknowledged that \u201cwe have low confidence in our assessment\u201d when it comes to understanding the current protests in Oregon\u2019s largest city.\n\n\u201cWe lack insight into the motives for the most recent attacks,\u201d the memo said.\n\nAD\n\nBaker included an image of that portion of the memo in a Twitter thread that also linked to the Times article. The DHS intelligence report included that tweet and stated that Baker had posted \u201ca leaked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) internal product.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Times declined to comment.\n\nThe other journalist, Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the editor in chief of Lawfare, had also posted various internal documents to his Twitter feed, including, on July 24, a memo admonishing department personnel not to give information to reporters.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe ongoing leaks related to our work in Portland remain of great concern as it distracts from our mission and creates opportunities for others to exploit this information for their own benefit,\u201d the unsigned memo states.\n\nAD\n\nThe memo was written in response to reporting in Lawfare and The Washington Post days earlier about the new guidance to collect information on people who threatened memorials and statues. The memo defended the intelligence office\u2019s authority and said its work had \u201cinformed our analysis on the enduring threat environment [in Portland] and disrupted attempted violent attacks.\u201d\n\nWittes told The Post that he didn\u2019t object to the department expressing concerns about leaks and that if officials had sent a link to his tweet in a message to employees, he wouldn\u2019t object.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the sharing of my tweet that\u2019s disturbing. It\u2019s the construction of it as an intelligence report on a U.S. person that\u2019s disturbing,\u201d Wittes said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf the department was willing to document public statements this way, what would stop DHS from \u201cmaking a public record dossier on me?\u201d Wittes asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m considering my legal options and will have more to say about this at a later date,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a subsequent tweet that was also the subject of an intelligence report, Wittes posted an internal memo from Brian Murphy, the DHS acting undersecretary for intelligence and analysis and a former FBI agent, announcing that officials were changing the terminology used for individuals attacking federal facilities. The decision, Murphy wrote, was based in part on the Open Source Intelligence Reports that officials had reviewed about protesters.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say any longer that this violent situation is opportunistic,\u201d Murphy wrote, adding that intelligence \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d led officials to believe that the attackers were driven by \u201canarchist\u201d and \u201cviolent antifa\u201d ideologies.\n\nMurphy\u2019s conclusions cut against the earlier DHS memo, which the Times reported, that said the department didn\u2019t have enough information to know whether the Portland protesters were connected to anti-government groups that had a history of operating in the region.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-compiled-intelligence-reports-on-journalists-who-published-leaked-documents/2020/07/30/5be5ec9e-d25b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html", "author": ["Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter"]}, {"title": "Trump campaign hits pause on TV ad spending for 'review' of messaging strategy", "text": "Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

And it has effectively nothing booked through August.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Biden's campaign has spent $3.9 million over those two days and has another almost $6 million booked through the end of August.\n\nWhen asked about the lack of spending, a Trump campaign official pointed to the decision earlier this month to demote Parscale and elevate deputy campaign manager Bill Stepien to fill that role.\n\nLet our news meet your inbox.

We\u2019ll be back on the air shortly, even more forcefully exposing Joe Biden as a puppet of the radical left-wing,\" the official told NBC News.\n\nAs part of a broader strategy to shift the public's focus from coronavirus to fears over crime and anarchy, the campaign has so far put most of its money behind a spot that attacks Biden over Democratic calls to \"defund the police.\" Advertising Analytics data shows the campaign has spent almost $17 million to run the spot on broadcast and national cable since the beginning of July.\n\nThe spot imagines a police department slashed by budget cuts that asks victims of serious violent crimes to leave a message and hear back from officers in five days.\n\nBut the spot says that Biden's \"supporters are fighting to defund police departments.\" Biden himself has said he doesn't support blanket cuts to departments, but agrees with activists calling to reallocate police funding toward other public programs and to condition at least some federal funding on reforms.\n\nEven before the pause, there were signs that the Trump campaign was shifting its advertising strategy amid the president's lag in recent polls.\n\nAfter spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a week running ads in Michigan through June and half of July, the campaign dropped that to just $78,000 for the week of July 14 and to less than $10,000 the week of July 21.\n\nRecent polling from Fox News and CNN have found Trump trailing Biden by margins of 9 points and 12 points among registered voters in Michigan in recent days.\n\nThe campaign also had made other ad spending changes in the weeks before this pause, ramping up spending in Iowa, Georgia, Florida and Ohio since the middle of June.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has been off the airwaves, its allies haven't gone dark. America First Action, the campaign's top aligned super PAC, spent $1 million over the past two days, while Restoration PAC, another super PAC, has spent $360,000.\n\nAnd the campaign still has the $146.6 million in general-election television and radio spending booked from Labor Day through Election Day.\n\nBut America First Action has been getting heavily outspent by other Democratic PACs in recent months, causing growing anxiety among Republicans. Democratic super PACs have spent almost four times as much on television and radio as America First, and the trend is set to continue, according to ad spending figures through the end of last week.", "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/trump-campaign-pauses-tv-ad-spending-review-messaging-strategy-n1235376", "author": ["Ben Kamisar", "Ben Kamisar Is A Political Writer For Nbc News.", "Shannon Pettypiece", "Shannon Pettypiece Is The Senior White House Reporter For Nbcnews.Com."]}, {"title": "'I don't want a delay': Trump rows back on delaying election but not on mail-in ballots", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump on Thursday appeared to row back on the idea of delaying the 2020 election, even as he continued to raise doubts about efforts to expand mail-in voting in some states to respond to the coronavirus.\n\n\"Do I want to see a date change?

John Lewis in Atlanta. At his funeral ceremony, the first Black president of the United States, Barack Obama, gave a eulogy that served both to pay tribute to one of the greatest leaders of the American civil rights movement and call for specific action to carry on that legacy. It will likely go down as one of Obama\u2019s greatest speeches, and it is worth watching in full.\n\nIn a speech that was almost surprising in its frank invocation of politics, Obama compared the brutal 1965 violence that nearly ended Lewis\u2019 life\u2014police fractured his skull on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama\u2014to the violent suppression of peaceful protests by federal officers today, called the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision to gut the Voting Rights Act and the wave of voter suppression that followed \u201can attack on what John fought for,\u201d challenged hypocritical congressional leaders who have opposed a renewal of \u201cthe law that [Lewis] was willing to die for\u201d while issuing empty statements calling him a \u201chero,\u201d called for the end to the disenfranchisement of formerly incarcerated people, called for making Election Day a national holiday, called for statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico, and called for \u201celiminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American.\u201d\n\nThe barnburner of a political speech followed a powerful retelling of some of the highlights of Lewis\u2019 life and career, a narrative that laid the groundwork for Obama\u2019s call to action. It seemed clear that Obama was devastated by the death of a man he called a mentor.\n\n\u201cIt is a great honor to be back at Ebenezer Baptist Church in the pulpit of its greatest pastor, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., to pay my respects to perhaps his finest disciple,\u201d Obama said near the start of his remarks, his voice nearly breaking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come here today, because I, like so many Americans, owe a great debt to John Lewis and his forceful vision of freedom,\u201d Obama continued.\n\nObama then described Lewis\u2019 rise from a place of \u201cmodest means\u201d in rural Troy, Alabama, where, as a boy, he eavesdropped on his father\u2019s discussions with friends about the murderous violence of the local Ku Klux Klan.

John got a taste of jail for the first, second, third, well, several times. But he also got a taste of victory and it consumed him with righteous purpose and he took the battle deeper into the South.\u201d Obama then described Lewis\u2019 work to desegregate buses in the South \u201cmonths before the first official Freedom Rides.\u201d\n\nBut Obama\u2019s narrative was not just a powerful retelling of the life of an icon and founding member of the most democratic stage of American democracy\u2014it tied Lewis\u2019 work in the 1960s to America\u2019s present-day struggle with authoritarianism and voter suppression.\n\n\u201cSometimes, we read about this and we kind of take it for granted, or at least we act as if it was inevitable.

But according to new, comprehensive national guidelines from a network of research, policy and public-health experts convened by Harvard University\u2019s Global Health Institute and Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, the latest federal report probably isn\u2019t serious enough.\n\nWhy? Because the steps it recommends may be too weak to suppress the virus, and the threshold at which it recommends them may be too high.\n\nThe Trump task force, for instance, doesn\u2019t advise authorities to issue stay-at-home orders \u2014 anywhere. But if the Harvard experts had their way, 13 states would lock down right now. Another 22 would be considering lockdowns.\n\nCDC\n\nThe White House task force and the Harvard researchers are relying on the same data. They\u2019re using similar color-coded risk charts. They even share a goal: to provide clear metrics that will \u201chelp communities determine the severity of the outbreak they are responding to,\u201d as the Harvard initiative puts it, then offer \u201cbroad guidance on the intensity of control efforts needed based on these COVID risk levels.\u201d\n\nYet Harvard and the Trump task force arrive at very different conclusions about how communities should be responding.\n\nThis difference underscores the ongoing inconsistency of America\u2019s efforts to combat COVID-19. It also raises the question of whether Americans will look back on unheeded recommendations such as Harvard\u2019s with regret this fall, when colder weather, increased indoor activity and, in many places, a return to in-person schooling compound the risk of a second wave of infection \u2014 especially if dozens of states remain in the so-called red zone.\n\n\u201cThe public needs clear and consistent information about COVID risk levels in different jurisdictions for personal decision-making, and policy-makers need clear and consistent visibility that permits differentiating policy across jurisdictions,\u201d said Danielle Allen, director of Harvard\u2019s Safra Center. \u201cWe also collectively need to keep focused on what should be our main target: a path to near zero case incidence.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nHarvard and the Trump task force define the red zone differently, but both base their color-coded risk levels on a key metric: the seven-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people.\n\nThe \u201cseven-day average\u201d part is important because it smooths out daily fluctuations due to reporting. The \u201cnew daily cases\u201d part is important because it offers a current snapshot of the scale of the outbreak. And the \u201cper 100,000 people\u201d part is important because it ensures that this scale is consistent across jurisdictions.\n\nBasically, the seven-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people is just a simple way to track how much virus is circulating in a particular population.\n\nThe Trump task force has three risk levels: red, yellow, green. Any area reporting a total of more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people between July 18 and July 24 \u2014 that\u2019s an average of 14.3 per day \u2014 is in the red zone. Any area reporting a total of between 10 and 100 new cases per 100,000 people over the same period \u2014 for an average of 1.43 to 14.3 per day \u2014 is in the yellow zone. And any area reporting fewer than 10 new cases over the same period is in the green zone. (The percentage of local tests coming back positive factors in as well.)\n\nThe Harvard team, meanwhile, has four risk levels. Red is any place that averaged more than 25 new daily cases per 100,000 people over the last seven days. Orange is between 10 and 25. Yellow is between one and 10. And green is fewer than one.\n\nIn short, the two groups categorize states in different ways. But that\u2019s only a superficial difference. The real difference is what they\u2019re telling residents and authorities to do when cases reach a certain threshold in their area.\n\nLet\u2019s say that threshold is 14.3 new daily cases per 100,000 people \u2014 the Trump task force\u2019s red zone. According to the feds, residents in this red zone should \u201cwear a mask at all times outside the home and maintain physical distance\u201d and \u201creduce your public interactions and activities to 25 percent of your normal activity.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, public officials should \u201cclose bars and gyms and create outdoor dining opportunities with pedestrian areas,\u201d \u201climit social gatherings to 10 people or fewer\u201d and \u201censure that all business retailers and personal services require masks and can safely social distance.\u201d\n\nBut nowhere does the Trump task force say that public officials in a red zone should require residents to \u201cstay at home.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the Harvard group says that \u201cat the red level, jurisdictions have reached a tipping point for uncontrolled spread and will require the use of stay-at-home orders and/or advisories to mitigate the disease.\u201d\n\nRight now, that would mean 13 of the Trump task force\u2019s 21 red-zone states returning to lockdown: Florida (with a staggering 48.1 new daily cases per 100,000 people), Louisiana (46.2), Mississippi (43.5), Alabama (39.1), Arizona (36.6), Tennessee (34.1), Georgia (33.8), Nevada (33.0), South Carolina (30.1), Texas (27.9), Idaho (27.5), Arkansas (26.4) and Oklahoma (25.6).\n\nA member of the medical staff treats a patient who is wearing a helmet-based ventilator in the COVID-19 intensive care unit at the United Memorial Medical Center in Houston on Tuesday. (Go Nakamura/Getty Images)\n\nThe other eight task force red-zone states \u2014 California (23.5), Missouri (22.0), North Dakota (18.2), North Carolina (18.1), Utah (17.9), Iowa (16.3), Wisconsin (15.7) and Kansas (14.2) \u2014 would fall into Harvard\u2019s orange zone.\n\nSo do an additional 14 states, including several \u2014 such as New Mexico (15.6), Nebraska (15.1) and Maryland (14.6) \u2014 that seem to be getting worse fast.\n\nIn the orange zone, Harvard says, \u201ccommunity spread has accelerated\u201d to \u201cdangerous levels\u201d and \u201cstay-at-home orders are advised\u201d (unless \u201cviral testing and contact tracing capacity\u201d are sufficiently robust).\n\nIf implemented, the Harvard framework wouldn\u2019t necessarily force entire states to stay at home. In fact, the group has produced a county-by-county COVID-19 risk map and argues that \u201cpolicy decisions about which strategies of disease response are best for a jurisdiction should be made by looking at both the local level and the state picture and considering the dynamic relationship between them.\u201d\n\nIn Ohio, for instance, that might mean issuing a stay-at-home order in Mercer County (33.7 new daily cases per 100,000), but not across the state as a whole (11.0).\n\nIn on-the-cusp California (23.5), it might mean holding off statewide but requiring residents of orange-zone Los Angeles County (24.2) to stay at home because they are surrounded by four red-zone counties: Kern (91.6), Riverside (30.1), San Bernardino (33.0) and Ventura (27.7).\n\nNationwide, however, it would mean putting targeted lockdowns back on the table, followed by dramatically expanded testing and tracing.\n\nThat\u2019s a solution the Trump task force has shied away from, even as it acknowledges the severity of a pandemic that has infected at least 4.4 million Americans, killed 150,000 and now, after a brief late-spring plateau, propelled more than 40 percent of U.S. states into its self-described red zone.\n\nIn recent days, case growth in some of those states has started to stabilize, or even decline. That has led Trump to declare, as he did earlier this week, that \u201ca lot of governors should be opening up states that they\u2019re not opening up.\u201d\n\nBut the point the Harvard group is making is that even if spread is slowing, there\u2019s still too much virus circulating to ease up now. The goal should be suppression, they say: striving for zero cases instead of just somewhat mitigating the current spread.\n\nA suppression strategy is \u201cthe most efficient path toward a restored economy without future lockdowns,\u201d the Harvard team explained. \u201cSuccessful suppression efforts can work relatively fast to restore jurisdictions to near-zero case incidence in a matter of 1-2 months.\u201d\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, echoed this advice in a new interview with Wired. Asked why \u201cthe US has done so poorly in suppressing this pandemic compared with other rich countries,\u201d Fauci highlighted the importance of locking down \u201cin full force.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther, certainly Asian countries, and certainly the European Union, when they so-called locked down \u2014 shut down, shelter in place, whatever you want to call it \u2014 they did it to about 95 percent of their countries,\u201d he said. \u201cSome countries got hit badly, but once they locked down and turned things around, they came down to a very low baseline \u2014 down to tens or hundreds of new cases a day, not thousands. They came down and they stayed down.\n\n\u201cNow, in the United States, when we shut down, even though it was a stress and a strain for a lot of people, we only did it to the tune of about 50 percent of the country shutting down,\u201d Fauci continued. \u201cOur curve goes up and starts to come down. But we never came down to a reasonable baseline. We came down to about 20,000 new infections per day, and we stayed at that level for several weeks in a row. Then we started to open up \u2014 getting America \u2018back to normal\u2019 \u2014 and started to see the cases go from 20,000 a day to 30,000, 40,000. We even hit that one point last week of 70,000 new cases a day.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if we want to suppress COVID-19 to the level that would actually make a full reopening safe \u2014 if we want the whole country to be in the yellow zone, heading toward green \u2014 then the path we\u2019re currently on won\u2019t get us there before a vaccine arrives.\n\nInstead, we may spend the rest of the summer making the same mistake we made in the spring \u2014 and setting ourselves up for a very rough fall.\n\n_____\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/these-are-the-13-states-that-need-to-lock-down-now-according-to-harvard-coronavirus-experts-162201179.html", "author": ["Andrew Romano", "West Coast Correspondent"]}, {"title": "Oil sinks on weak U.S. economic data, political uncertainty", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices sank on Thursday following poor U.S. economic figures and after U.S. President Donald Trump roiled markets with a suggestion that the nation should delay its November presidential election.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Pumpjacks are seen during sunset at the Daqing oil field in Heilongjiang province, China August 22, 2019.

Edgar Hoover Building wondered if there would be more shoes to drop.\n\nWould Trump dismiss more people? Would he shut down the investigation of his campaign's ties to Russia? Would the President demand that the Bureau cease its investigation of Michael Flynn , Trump's onetime national security adviser?\n\nIn response to these concerns, the FBI took extraordinary -- and previously undisclosed -- steps to protect its investigations.\n\nFrom Comey's first meetings with Trump, shortly after he won the presidency, the FBI director developed misgivings about his new boss' behavior -- about Trump's demands for \"loyalty,\" and even more unnerving, his request that the Bureau drop its investigation of Flynn. Comey's conversations with Trump had been so distressing that the director started writing up contemporaneous summaries of their interactions and sharing them with a handful of top officials at the Bureau. Now, suddenly, Comey was out -- and the question arose of what to do with his memos about his conversations with the President.\n\nThe initial decision fell to Andrew McCabe , who was Comey's deputy and now the acting director of the FBI. McCabe thought Trump's behavior was sufficiently problematic to be investigated for possible obstruction of justice, and he told his team to open a criminal case.\n\nGiven the wild pace of events, McCabe couldn't be sure how long he'd last as director, so he wanted to lock down as much evidence as possible. Most important, he told the investigating agents to place Comey's memos in SENTINEL, the FBI's case management software. McCabe knew that once documents were inside the system, they were virtually impossible to remove. With Comey's memos in the system, the investigators were certain to have access to them -- even if McCabe himself would eventually be gone.\n\nIndeed, FBI officials even went a step farther. Once McCabe became director, Bureau employees grew so concerned that Trump would try to shut down the investigation that they secreted at least three copies of key documents, including Comey's memos, in remote locations around the Bureau. This was to make sure that in the event Trump directed an end to these inquiries, the documents could always be preserved, located, and shared.\n\nOn May 17, eight days after Trump fired Comey, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, announced that he had appointed Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the FBI from 2001 to 2013, to serve as special counsel. Rosenstein gave Mueller a broad mandate -- to investigate ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, as well as any matters that arose from his investigation. Mueller's team ultimately took possession of Comey's memos, and they proved to be important evidence in the report Mueller filed two years later. As Mueller later learned, and included in his report, Trump seriously contemplated firing the special counsel on several occasions -- so the initial suspicions at the FBI, about the President's real intentions, were well-grounded.\n\nJUST WATCHED Ex-FBI deputy director: Here's what briefing Trump is like Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ex-FBI deputy director: Here's what briefing Trump is like 00:59\n\nMore recently, though, the suspicions have generally run the other way. Over the past several months, the President has mobilized his administration and its supporters to prove that the FBI's investigation was flawed, or worse, from its inception. William Barr, Trump's attorney general, has directed John Durham, the US attorney in Connecticut, to conduct a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading to the investigation, to determine whether FBI officials or anyone else engaged in misconduct at the outset. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has also convened hearings on the investigation's origins. The working assumption of these inquiries appears to be that Trump was wronged by overzealous pursuers.\n\nThe truth, however, is precisely the opposite. The story of the Mueller investigation is in great measure a story of prosecutorial restraint. And this was true, too, in the satellite investigation that touched on Trump in the Southern District of New York. As both investigations were unfolding, there was a great deal of speculation that prosecutors were scrutinizing Trump's financial history, including his tax returns.\n\nBut the truth, first reported here, is that neither Mueller nor the Southern District prosecutors sought out Trump's financial records or obtained his tax returns, as they had the opportunity to do.\n\nWhy not? Why didn't prosecutors obtain this evidence? After all, it was long known that Trump had business ambitions in Russia; he had been attempting to build a tower in Moscow since the 1980s. Indeed, in 2015, while his presidential campaign was already underway, Trump signed a letter of intent to develop a building in Moscow. (The letter was non-binding, and no money changed hands, but the agreement was clear about Trump's ambitions.) At the same time, one of the core questions of the Russia investigation was why Trump was so solicitous of Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader. Trump not only praised Putin repeatedly, but he encouraged Russia's efforts to support his 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton.\n\nAs Mueller discovered, Russia went to extraordinary lengths to do just that. The Internet Research Agency, a nominally private company in St. Petersburg with close ties to Putin, conducted a social media campaign for Trump and against Clinton. And in an even more sinister and damaging way, the military intelligence wing of the Russian Army hacked emails from the Democratic Party and John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman. Their release, through WikiLeaks as an intermediary, greatly damaged Clinton's chances against Trump.\n\nTrump's high regard for Putin -- and the Russian government's efforts on Trump's behalf -- raised the obvious question of whether there were financial motives at work. What were Trump's business ties to Russia? Did Russia have a financial stake in Trump's candidacy? Did Trump have financial interests in Russia? Neither Mueller nor the Southern District ever found out.\n\nWhy Mueller held back\n\nAccording to members of Mueller's staff, the special counsel's main reason for forgoing a financial investigation of Trump was somewhat abstract. It concerned the legal concept of state of mind -- specifically, the difference between corrupt intent and motive. Most federal crimes, and certainly all the ones that Mueller was investigating, are what are known as \"intent\" crimes. In order to be found guilty of an intent crime, a defendant must know that what he's doing is wrong. For prosecutors, it's usually pretty easy to prove intent -- a defendant's attempts at secrecy, or to lie about or cover up his actions, usually suffice to prove intent.\n\nIf there was ever going to be a prosecution of Trump, the prosecutors believed, there would be no problem proving intent.\n\nMotive is related to intent, but a much broader concept. A defendant's motive to commit a crime could include financial gain, jealous rivalry, or an unhappy childhood. When bringing a criminal case, prosecutors often find it helpful to prove a defendant's motive, but the law does not require it. It's necessary only to prove intent. Mueller's prosecutors thought Trump's financial records and tax returns went to possible motive, not intent, so they thought they didn't need the evidence.\n\nJUST WATCHED Toobin: Mueller obviously had a problem with Barr summary Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toobin: Mueller obviously had a problem with Barr summary 02:25\n\nThere was another factor. As a special counsel, Mueller's jurisdiction was limited by his charter from Rosenstein. Rosenstein had directed Mueller to investigate \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with\" the Trump campaign. Trump's financial records were not directly relevant to that issue. In order to pursue the financial records, and especially the tax returns, Mueller would have had to ask Rosenstein to expand his jurisdiction.\n\nRosenstein never denied any of Mueller's requests, but Mueller couldn't be sure that he could justify this expansion to Rosenstein. Even in fraud investigations, it's unusual for Department of Justice prosecutors to seek their subjects' tax returns, especially when, as here, Mueller had no evidence that Trump had cheated on his taxes. (Of course, Trump refused to disclose his tax returns voluntarily, as all presidential candidates had done for more than a generation; this was suspicious behavior by Trump, but not actual evidence that he committed a crime.)\n\nMueller thought that if he tried to expand his mandate to look at Trump's possible financial misdeeds, that would look like a fishing expedition, which he was determined to avoid. So, Mueller and his team never found out the nature, if any, of Trump's financial ties to Russia.\n\nMichael Cohen and the 'Deep State'\n\nThe Southern District of New York, the US Attorney's office in Manhattan, was only involved in the investigation because of an act of restraint by Mueller and his team.\n\nEarly in Mueller's tenure, his staff became aware of possible criminal activity by Michael Cohen, who worked as Trump's personal attorney. Shortly before the 2016 election, Cohen had orchestrated a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, in return for her silence about a brief relationship she had with Trump. This was a possible illegal campaign contribution. (Trump has denied the affair.)\n\nCohen had also engaged in questionable financial dealings on his own. Early in 2018, Mueller decided that these areas were outside his jurisdiction and shared the evidence with the Southern District of New York. The Manhattan prosecutors, in turn, went after Cohen aggressively, obtaining search warrants for his office and home in April of that year.\n\nAt that time, many news accounts suggested that the Southern District prosecutors, who have a reputation for independence and aggressiveness, presented a major threat to Trump. This was also because the Manhattan prosecutors were not limited by any sort of directive from Rosenstein. They could follow the evidence wherever it might lead.\n\nSurely, the speculation went, the Southern District would use its investigation of Cohen to look into Trump's financial dealings, including his tax returns. Trump himself, who reacted with fury to the raid on his lawyer's properties, seemed to be worried about that very prospect.\n\nStill, what Trump didn't know, and what the breathless news coverage of the Cohen raid didn't recognize, was that the Southern District's investigation of Michael Cohen ... was an investigation of Michael Cohen. It was not, and never would be, an investigation of Donald Trump.\n\nThe prosecutors in New York showed the same caution and restraint that Mueller's team displayed in Washington. It's almost part of the DNA of experienced prosecutors to tread carefully beyond areas where they can identify specific criminal behavior. This was why Trump's repeated invocations of the Democratic affiliations of Mueller's staff, while understandable, missed the point. (Most of Mueller's lawyers had made campaign contributions to Democrats over the years.)\n\nMore important than the political inclinations of Mueller's team was their professional training as prosecutors, and those honed instincts limited their ambitions. The same was true for the prosecutors in New York. Notwithstanding the rumors (and the hopes of Trump's political opponents), the Southern District prosecutors never sought or obtained Trump's tax returns or subpoenaed his financial records, at Deutsche Bank or anywhere else.\n\nJUST WATCHED Toobin on Trump's IRS claim: I have no idea what he's saying Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toobin on Trump's IRS claim: I have no idea what he's saying 03:37\n\nTheir reluctance to delve into Trump's behavior or finances was heightened, too, by the Office of Legal Counsel opinions, in 1973 and 2000, barring prosecution of a sitting president. If the Southern District couldn't bring charges against Trump anyway, the thinking went, there was no point in examining his behavior -- especially since none of it, on the surface, looked criminal.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, saw the Cohen raid as more than just another unfair attack on him, but rather as part of a continuum of harassment that he had experienced since he won the election. The President believed that the deep state -- or, as he sometimes called it, the \"Crooked and Demented Deep State\" -- had mobilized against him from day one.\n\nComey of the FBI turned on him even before the inauguration. John Brennan, Obama's director of the CIA, became a harsh critic on MSNBC. (\"Deep state henchman,\" Trump called Brennan.) Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal opened the door for Rosenstein to appoint Mueller, who in turn set the \"13 angry Democrats\" against him. As for Don McGahn, the \"lying bastard\" who was his White House counsel, he was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's man, an establishment figure, a favorite of The New York Times; all that, in Trump's view, was why McGahn turned against him.\n\nWith the Cohen investigation, Trump thought that the Southern District was also revealing itself to be a deep state outpost. Trump had fired Preet Bharara, the previous US attorney there, after promising to keep him on. As President, Trump then took the unusual step of interviewing the man who became his replacement, Geoffrey Berman. (Presidents rarely interview US attorney candidates.) But Berman recused himself from the Cohen investigation (for still-unexplained reasons), which meant that the case was supervised by his deputy, Robert Khuzami, who had been an Obama-era appointee to a top job at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn other words, as the President saw it, the two Trump appointees who should have been protecting him \u2014 Sessions and Berman -- had recused themselves and left him to the mercies of the deep state. Of course, implicit in Trump's theory of the deep state was that he had never done anything to deserve the scrutiny of the FBI, the CIA, or the Justice Department. For Trump, his own blamelessness was a given.\n\nJUST WATCHED Toobin: This makes incompetence of Justice Department so clear Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Toobin: This makes incompetence of Justice Department so clear 01:29\n\nIn truth, for all of Trump's complaints about the \"witch hunts\" that pursued him, he had much to be grateful for in how the Mueller and Southern District investigations were conducted. It was true that in the early days of the Russia investigation, FBI officials took extraordinary steps to protect their investigation -- and their evidence -- from the possibility of presidential interference.\n\nBut once the investigations began in earnest, both Mueller and the Southern District refused to take the most aggressive, and arguably appropriate, steps to dig into Trump's history. If the President's financial records and tax returns contained any secrets, or incriminating information, the prosecutors never found them -- because they never looked.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/politics/jeffrey-toobin-trump-fbi-mueller-true-crimes-and-misdemeanors/index.html", "author": ["Jeffrey Toobin", "Cnn Chief Legal Analyst"]}, {"title": "Latest USA Swing State Voting Intention (19 to 24 July)", "text": "Redfield & Wilton Strategies\u2019 latest polls across six US swing states find Joe Biden ahead of Donald Trump in all six states, with leads ranging from 1% in North Carolina to 12% in Michigan. Relative to our results in June, Donald Trump has narrowed the gap in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, but has fallen further behind in Arizona, Florida, and Michigan. In Wisconsin, Biden\u2019s 10% lead has remained relatively stable since our first swing state voting intention in May.[1]\n\nEnthusiasm Gap\n\nDespite the leads that Joe Biden holds over Donald Trump, Trump\u2019s likely voters express a greater enthusiasm for voting for their preferred candidate. 54% to 67% of likely Trump voters say they are very enthusiastic (a 3 out of 3 on a scale of enthusiasm) about voting for Trump. Meanwhile, 40% to 49% of likely Biden voters say they have that level of enthusiasm for voting for Biden.\n\nMoreover, across all states, likely Trump voters are significantly more likely to say they are primarily voting for Donald Trump because they support Donald Trump (rather than because they oppose Joe Biden), while a majority of likely Biden voters say the primary reason they plan to vote for Biden is that they oppose Donald Trump (rather than because they support Biden).\n\nVoting In-Person and Mail-In Votes\n\nThis gap in enthusiasm presents itself, most interestingly, in the willingness of Trump voters to vote in-person on election day. When asked how comfortable they would be voting in person on election day (on scale of 0 to 5), between 36% and 44% of likely Trump voters say they are \u2018very comfortable\u2019 (5 out of 5) voting in-person on election day. Meanwhile, only 9% to 15% of likely Biden voters express the same degree of comfort with voting in person in November.[2]\n\nIn fact, when asked by what means they are most likely to vote in the Presidential Election, likely Biden voters overwhelmingly said they will be voting by mail, with North Carolina the lone exception. Likely Trump voters, meanwhile, were significantly more likely to say they would be voting in-person.[3] Evidence of this difference is visible in states where absentee ballots have already been requested.\n\nThe implications of this difference cannot be understated. In effect, in some states, election day will see a significant turnout of voters for Donald Trump. Among those voting in-person on election day, Donald Trump wins overwhelmingly in all six swing states.\n\nMeanwhile, among those voting by mail, Joe Biden is the clear winner in all six states. [4]\n\nOf course, this difference may change well before Election Day, depending on the coronavirus situation. Note, for instance, that in Arizona, which is presently undergoing a significant uptick in cases, more than half of likely Trump voters also say they will be voting by mail. In this sense, the greater expression of comfort among likely Trump voters and greater degree of caution among likely Biden voters about voting in-person could simply be a difference in pessimism or optimism about what the coronavirus situation will look like in early November.\n\nIndeed, in all six states, likely Biden voters mostly believe that \u2018the worst is yet to come\u2019 with respect to the coronavirus pandemic, whereas likely Trump voters tend to believe that \u2018the worst is behind us.\u2019\n\nTherefore, if the coronavirus ameliorates, we could see many more likely Biden voters saying they will be comfortable voting in person, whereas if the situation deteriorates, more likely Trump voters could then say they will vote by mail. However, this outlook could remain the same, given that many likely Trump voters live in rural areas where there has been less spread of the virus due to network effects.\n\nNevertheless, our results as currently configured present a potential logistical nightmare, reminiscent of the Iowa Democratic Primary in February. If some states see more than half of their voters voting by mail, the United States Postal Service will be under significant strain. Absentee ballots are valid as long as they are post-marked on or before Election Day, meaning that many votes could still be in transit on Election Day and will be counted in the days that follow. This delay could potentially change a result in the days that follow the election, given the vast difference between likely Biden voters and likely Trump voters in how they plan to vote. According to CBS, about 73,000 out of 33 million mail-in ballots arrived too late to be counted in 2016. With this election likely to see many more mail-in votes, such logistical hurdles could mean that the result of the election could be uncertain for several days (and even weeks, as seen in the New York Primary) following Election Day.\n\nOpinion on Mail-In Voting\n\nAnd, of course, this uncertainty provides the opportunity to claim fraud. When prompted with a statement suggesting that mail-in voting provides too great of an opportunity for fraud, majorities in North Carolina and Florida, and pluralities in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin agreed. In all six states, a significant number of likely Trump voters strongly agreed that mail-in voting provides too much of an opportunity for electoral fraud.\n\nAt the same time, however, majorities of respondents in four states said they would support the election being carried out exclusively by mail in their state. Again, these results had a partisan dimension, with likely Biden voters tending to be supportive and likely Trump voters tending to be opposed.\n\nThis scenario is further complicated by the fact that respondents are largely split on whom they think is more likely to win the election, despite polling presently indicating leads for Joe Biden. In Arizona and North Carolina, a plurality think Donald Trump is more likely to win, whereas in the other four states, particularly in Wisconsin, pluralities think Joe Biden will win.\n\nKey Campaign Issues\n\nAnother indication that this race will be closer than it presently appears is President Donald Trump\u2019s strength on key issues: the economy and China. When asked which of the two main candidates \u2018can get the economy going\u2019 and will \u2018be tough on China,\u2019 respondents in all six states were more likely to pick Donald Trump.\n\nAs the President intensifies his barbs on the mental sharpness of Joe Biden, respondents were also more likely (although barely) to say Donald Trump is in good physical and mental health than Joe Biden in four states, with respondents split in Michigan and selecting Biden in Wisconsin.\n\nThat a quarter of respondents select \u2018Don\u2019t Know\u2019 on this question, however, paints a pessimistic view of the next four years for the United States, regardless of who wins the Presidency in November. Moreover, when respondents in all six states were asked about Trump\u2019s physical and mental health without comparison to Joe Biden, they were most likely to say the President is not in good physical and mental health.\n\nThe Achilles heel for Donald Trump, however, remains his difficulty appearing compassionate or like a President that can unify the country. Respondents in all six states were reluctant to describe the President as someone who \u2018cares about people like me\u2019 or \u2018can bring Americans together.\u2019 Meanwhile, Joe Biden scored particularly well in both respects.\n\nAnd Finally, Kanye West\u2019s Candidacy\n\nShort of a last-minute replacement for the two main nominees, there is unlikely to be any other major contender for the Presidency. Another change from our June swing state polls is the addition of Kanye West in three states where he could still register on the ballot: Arizona (4 September deadline), Pennsylvania (3 August deadline), and Wisconsin (4 August deadline).

Creating a \u201cshell bill,\u201d as it\u2019s called, is a legislative gimmick used by both parties that allows the Senate to work around the language of the Constitution (somewhat like a reverse merger in business).\n\nArticle I, Section 7, of the Constitution, also known as the origination clause, reads in part: \u201cAll bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives.\u201d So if the Senate wants to go first, it has to find a bill that has already passed in the House and make that the vehicle for the new legislation. What usually happens is that a senator offers an amendment that is actually a whole new bill to an existing bill that the House has already approved.\n\nThe Senate is proceeding in this case because the House isn\u2019t yet ready with its health care legislation. That\u2019s partially because the House has three bills that have to be melded into one, and it takes time to make such a turducken. House leaders have also been consciously moving no faster than their Senate colleagues because they don\u2019t want to pay a penalty for going first. House leaders don\u2019t want Democrats to have to make difficult votes on controversial legislation and then get abandoned by the Senate if it never takes up a bill.\n\nHouse Democrats remember when, in the early months of the Clinton administration, they reluctantly backed a proposed tax on each unit of energy consumed\u2014the so-called BTU tax. The Senate ignored it. Republicans seized on the tax, clubbing their Democratic opponents with it as they took control of the House the following year. In the health care debate, House Democrats worry, among other things, that the Senate may not support the surcharge on wealthy Americans that the House version uses to raise revenue.\n\nAre Democratic Senate leaders up to something sneaky by using a shell bill? The Framers might think so. The origination clause was created in the careful arrangements made to preserve and enforce the separation of powers. Members at the Constitutional Convention also wanted the power to tax in the hands of those members of the legislature who had to answer directly to the people. (Direct popular election of senators did not come until 1913.)\n\nThe House can protect its prerogatives by \u201cblue slipping\u201d measures the leadership does not approve of. (It\u2019s called \u201cblue slipping\u201d because the resolution returning the offending bill to the Senate is printed on blue paper. And, we like to think, because their Senate colleagues become sad when this is done to them.) \u201cI do not deny their [the Senate\u2019s] right to send back a bill of a thousand pages as an amendment to our two lines,\u201d said Rep. James A. Garfield after the House had tabled a Senate bill in 1872. \u201cBut I do insist that their thousand pages must be on the subject matter of our bill.\u201d\n\nMore recently, in 2006, then-Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas threatened to blue-slip an immigration bill that originated in the Senate. In response, his Republican colleague in the Senate, Majority Leader Bill Frist, scraped out a bill on the Alternative Minimum Tax that had originated in the House and made it the immigration bill. In the last session, the TARP legislation was passed as a shell bill (it started out as the mental health parity bill), as was the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, which had once been a green-jobs bill.\n\nThe definition of what constitutes a \u201crevenue bill\u201d is still up for grabs, since the founders left the definition so vague. Over time, the courts and House custom have determined the Senate can perform this switcheroo as long as the Senate does not initiate bills whose primary purpose is raising funds for the general operation of the federal government. The House, often finding the parliamentary procedure in its interest, has objected only a little more than once a year over the last 20 years. Both Republicans and Democrats have used the trick while in the majority. Even in this season of hair-trigger umbrage, Republican Senate leadership aides aren\u2019t very worked up that Democrats are going to invoke this standard procedure.\n\nYou can, however, make the case that the dual-track approach is a part of the general hurry-up strategy that is a blow to transparency and thorough consideration. Administration and Democratic leaders have always believed that any delay in the process gives critics more time to gather strength. If the Senate were not allowed to begin debate until it received the House bill, that would extend the process a few weeks.\n\nSome conservatives worry the shell bill might turn into a shell game. Because the shell bill started in the House, it is possible House Democratic leaders could vote on it directly after the Senate is done with its work. That would really speed up the process. There would be no House amendments, no debate about those amendments, and no conference process to reconcile House and Senate versions of the health care legislation.\n\nWhen House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer was asked whether he might take this expedited approach, he ducked, refusing to rule it out, which undoubtedly made many Republicans nervous. But leadership aides in both chambers say this scenario is far-fetched. It would require House Democrats to shelve all of their ideas about health care and remove themselves from the process, which isn\u2019t going to happen. That\u2019s probably good\u2014because then health care reform would win a name unmentionable in polite company.", "link": "https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/10/how-the-senate-can-finesse-the-constitution-to-pass-health-care-reform.html", "author": ["John Dickerson"]}, {"title": "Sen.

But lurking beneath those high-profile questions are state legislative elections, which will set the political playing field, including Congressional districting, for the next 10 years.\n\nState legislatures determine policies that will affect millions of Americans. In addition, this year they decide who will draw the maps of U.S. Congressional and state legislative districts after the 2020 Census. Their reach will last a decade, unlike the presidency (4 years) and Senate seats (6 years).\n\nThe Princeton Election Consortium has designed a model to identify races where voters have the most leverage to prevent partisan gerrymandering in 2021. A few hundred voters mobilized in the right districts can bring about bipartisan control of redistricting, and get fairer districts for a decade. Our findings are in the PEC Moneyball map. (Later we will add other important state races, including U.S. Senate and state ballot questions.)\n\nOur calculations will help you direct your efforts as you decide where to get out the vote and where to donate. At a state and county level, you can take advantage of our calculations using our PEC 2020 ActBlue (for Democrats) and PEC 2020 WinRed (for Republicans).\n\nIn this post we describe the methodology used to determine redistricting voter power for state legislative elections. You can also find a more detailed version for election-math geeks here.\n\nWe followed a four-step process:\n\nStep 1: In each state, determine which 2020 electoral outcomes would give neither party the power to enact a partisan gerrymander. This is determined by the redistricting protocol set in the state\u2019s constitution. In many states, the two chambers of the state legislature draw the new districts, the governor may veto the plan, and the state legislature can override a veto with a supermajority. As a result, a state will have bipartisan redistricting as long as (1) one party does not control the governorship and both chambers of the state legislature and (2) one party does not have supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature. Some states have no governor\u2019s veto (e.g. NC), and we adjust the desired electoral outcomes accordingly. We assume that states with an independent redistricting commission (e.g. AZ) will not enact partisan gerrymanders. We focus on congressional gerrymandering and not state legislative gerrymandering, but it turns out that many of the high-leverage states have similar laws for the two processes.\n\nStep 2: In each state, determine the likelihood of an electoral outcome that results in bipartisan control of redistricting. This is not so easy; most forecasts for national elections rely heavily on public polling, but this data is not available for state legislature races. Furthermore, each state has tens or hundreds of small districts, each of which has different candidates and uncertain local dynamics. For this reason, we rely heavily on the race ratings of CNalysis, the only organization that offers comprehensive ratings for individual state legislature races. The group, led by Chaz Nuttycombe, looks at statewide election results in each district, adjusts for the effect of incumbent popularity, researches challengers to assess their quality, goes through campaign finance reports, and predicts demographic trends.\n\nOur model of state legislature elections takes as input the CNalysis race ratings, which consist of a favored party and a confidence level of \u201cUncontested,\u201d \u201cSafe,\u201d \u201cLean,\u201d \u201cTilt,\u201d or \u201cToss-Up\u201d (no favored party for Toss-Up). We then incorporate results from recent state legislature and presidential elections, which slightly differentiates districts with the same rating. Next, we model uncertainty in the outcome of each race, accounting for the possibility of a uniform shift across the state or among urban/suburban/rural voters. Putting all of this together, we can calculate the probability that the state legislature elections result in bipartisan control over redistricting.\n\nStep 3: In each district in a state, find the amount that a single new vote impacts the bipartisan control probability. We go through every district and run the model from step 2 after adding one to the expected number of votes for a given party. The change in probability gives an estimate of the chances that a given voter in the district will cast the consequential vote for bipartisan redistricting.\n\nStep 4: Quantify the effect across different states. Partisan gerrymandering is more impactful in more populous states, since it affects more seats in U.S. Congress. We estimate that these effects are about proportional to the number of congressional districts minus one, so we multiply the voter powers from step 3 by this number (based on projected 2020 Census results). After normalizing to a 0-100 scale, we get a list of the relative redistricting voter powers to prevent partisan gerrymandering.\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: If I want to donate money to prevent gerrymandering, which candidates should I give to?\n\nA: This model tells us where votes, not donations, have the highest leverage. These are not necessarily the same thing. There is evidence that political advertising is mostly useful for getting people to pay attention to a candidate, which makes it more effective for first-time candidates than well-known incumbents. Also, a dollar goes farther in a cheap media market and matters more to poorly-funded candidates than well-funded ones. We are not making specific donation recommendations, though we hope interested citizens can use our findings in conjunction with other available information to inform their political involvement in 2020.\n\nIn some cases, counties have an unusually high concentration of key districts. Examples include Johnson County, Kansas, and Tarrant County, Texas. At a state and county level, you can take advantage of our calculations using our PEC 2020 ActBlue (for Democrats) and PEC 2020 WinRed (for Republicans).\n\nQ: Why don\u2019t the Toss-Up seats always have the highest voter power in a state?\n\nA: Indeed, the Toss-Up seats are the likeliest to come down to a small number of votes on Election Day. However, if one party is favored to control a state legislative chamber, then the other party will have to do better than expected in order to gain control. This means that they will probably have to win most or all of the Toss-Up seats in order for the chamber to be competitive. If a district is part of almost all of a party\u2019s paths to redistricting power, it is not a high-leverage district. We are not trying to identify the districts most likely to be close, but the districts most likely to be the tipping point for our desired election outcome.\n\nQ: How often will you update this page?\n\nA: Every time CNalysis updates their state legislative ratings, we will re-run the model. They do updates about once a month. We may run the model weekly or bi-weekly between CNalysis updates, though the changes are likely to be small.\n\nWho did the work: Moneyball state legislative model, Jacob Wachspress and Connor Moffatt.

By 2040, it has been estimated there will be more than 1.2 million people living with dementia in England and Wales. There is currently no cure.\n\nHowever, while some risk factors for dementia cannot be changed, for example particular genes or ethnicity, many are down to lifestyle.\n\n\u201cDementia is potentially preventable \u2013 you can do things to reduce your risk of dementia, whatever stage of life you are at,\u201d said Gill Livingston, professor of psychiatry of older people at University College London and a co-author of the report.\n\nShe added such lifestyle changes could reduce the chances of developing dementia in both those with and without a high genetic risk for such conditions.\n\nThe report from the Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care builds on previous work revealing that about a third of dementia cases could be prevented by addressing nine lifestyle factors, including midlife hearing loss, depression, less childhood education and smoking.\n\nThe research weighs up the latest evidence, largely from high-income countries, supporting the addition of a further three risk factors to the list. It suggests that 1% of dementia cases worldwide are attributable to excessive mid-life alcohol intake, 3% to mid-life head injuries and 2% a result of exposure to air pollution in older age \u2013 although they caution that the latter could be an underestimate.\n\nWhile some actions can be taken on a personal level to tackle such issues, many require government-led change, Livingston said. The report includes a list of nine recommendations, including improving air quality, and urges policymakers to \u201cbe ambitious about prevention\u201d.\n\nLivingston praised Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign to tackle the nation\u2019s waistlines and reduce Covid-19 deaths, as obesity and lack of exercise are among the risk factors for dementia. \u201cThat may be helpful, particularly if they are beginning to think about obesogenic environments and making it safe for people to ride bikes,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Livingston said the 40% figure was optimistic as the 12 risk factors are unlikely to be completely addressed, small steps could make a difference. Research has suggested that the incidence of dementia in Europe and North America has fallen by around 15% per decade for the past 30 years \u2013 likely because of lifestyle changes such as a reduction in smoking \u2013 even though the numbers of people with dementia are rising as people live longer.\n\nThe impact of lifestyle interventions, the team add, is likely to be greatest among the most deprived individuals and in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is any coincidence that the reductions in dementia prevalence to date have been in high-income, highly educated people who have more control over their environment,\u201d said Livingston. \u201cWe are expecting by 2050 that two-thirds of people with dementia, if trajectories continue, will be in low-income countries.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear whether all the risk factors are purely a cause rather than an effect of dementia. The report notes: \u201cDepression might be a risk for dementia, but in later life dementia might cause depression.\u201d\n\nFiona Carragher, director of research and influencing at Alzheimer\u2019s Society, which part-funded the work, called for a boost to dementia research, warning that medical research charities are facing a 40% average fall in research funding because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFiona Matthews, professor of epidemiology at Newcastle University, who was not involved in the report, said the focus on lifestyle did not mean people should feel they are to blame if they develop dementia.\n\n\u201cWe can work at reducing our personal risk and society\u2019s risk, but still even then with these risk factors it only equates to less than 50% of all dementia,\u201d she said, adding that an increase in risk did not mean dementia was certain to develop.\n\nMatthews said tackling lifestyle risk factors, personally and as a society, remained important, adding that inequalities in population health, as highlighted by Covid-19, should be targeted.\n\n\u201cThe crucial component is that in the absence of treatments that delay or postpone dementia, reducing everyone\u2019s risk is the best method to slow the increasing numbers of people with dementia that we would see due to population ageing,\u201d she said.", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/30/lifestyle-changes-could-delay-or-prevent-40-of-dementia-cases-study", "author": ["Nicola Davis"]}, {"title": "Lifestyle changes could prevent a third of dementia cases, report suggests", "text": "More than a third of dementia cases might be avoided by tackling aspects of lifestyle including education, exercise, blood pressure and hearing, a new report suggests.\n\nApproximately 45 million people worldwide were thought to be living with dementia in 2015, at an estimated cost of $818bn.\n\n\n\nAnd numbers are rising: in England and Wales it is estimated that 1.2 million people will be living with dementia by 2040 \u2013 a 57% increase from 2016 figures, largely driven by people living longer.\n\nBut the new report from the Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care, stresses that dementia is not an inescapable part of ageing \u2013 and that action can be taken to reduce risk.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that individuals can do, and there are a lot of things that public health and policy can do, to reduce the numbers of people developing dementia,\u201d said Gill Livingston, professor of psychiatry of older people at University College London and a co-author of the report.\n\nFor many of the factors, including exercise and social activities, the best approach to reducing dementia risk is not yet clear, but Livingston stresses that steps can still be taken. \u201cWe expect it to be a long-term change that will be needed for exercise; joining a gym for two weeks is probably not going to do it,\u201d she said.\n\nClive Ballard, professor of age-related diseases at the University of Exeter medical school and also a co-author of the report, added that the evidence suggests individuals should also try to follow a Mediterranean diet, maintain a healthy weight and keep an eye on their blood pressure.\n\nIn total, the study looked at nine lifestyle factors linked to an increased risk of dementia.\n\nThe results reveal that as many as 35% of dementia cases could, at least in theory, be prevented, with 9% linked to midlife hearing loss, 8% to leaving education before secondary school, 5% to smoking in later life and 4% to later life depression. Social isolation, later life diabetes, midlife high blood pressure, midlife obesity and lack of exercise in later life also contributed to potentially avoidable cases of dementia, the report notes.\n\nBy contrast, 7% of cases would be prevented if a solution to the leading genetic risk factor for dementia were found.\n\nThe authors say the findings highlight the importance of health and behaviour throughout life on the risk of developing dementia later on.\n\nBut they admit that the estimate that more than a third of dementia cases could be prevented is a best case scenario, with the figures based on a number of assumptions, including that each factor could be completely tackled. \u201cI think the realistic figure is probably nearer 5%,\u201d said Ballard, although he added that even a 5% reduction would mean 5,000 fewer dementia cases in the UK per year.\n\nThe authors also acknowledge that for some of the factors flagged it is not yet clear whether interventions could reduce the risk of dementia or delay its onset. Debate also exists around whether factors such as depression and social isolation drive an increased risk of dementia, or whether changes in the brain that lead to dementia could be behind such issues.\n\n\u201cThere is lots of evidence that depression is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia. What we don\u2019t know is whether treating depression better prevents it,\u201d added Ballard.\n\nEven so, Fiona Matthews, professor of epidemiology at Newcastle University who was not involved in the report, said that interventions for depression and social isolation could still prove valuable. \u201cIf we could actually resolve some of that issue, even if it is not 100% causal, it is likely we might be able to slow [dementia] progression - even if [an individual] is on a pathway to developing dementia already,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Matthews noted that the report also showed that the majority of cases of dementia were not linked to the potentially preventable factors flagged, although she added that the proposed areas for action could offer myriad health benefits beyond lowering dementia risk.\n\n\n\nHowever, the authors pointed out that an intervention that delayed dementia onset and progression by even a year could decrease the number of people with dementia worldwide in 2050 by nine million.\n\n\n\nDr Doug Brown, director of research at Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said that the estimate that more than a third of dementia cases could be preventable was a cause for celebration, but noted that difficulties remain.\n\n\u201cNot all of the nine risk factors identified are easily modifiable \u2013 factors like poor education and social isolation are incredibly challenging to address. But there are easier wins, particularly cardiovascular factors like lowering blood pressure and smoking cessation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThough it\u2019s not inevitable, dementia is currently set to be the 21st century\u2019s biggest killer.

He uses \u201clow income housing\u201d as not-so-coded language for \u201chousing occupied by people of color,\u201d and his meaning is clear. White Americans, your property values would suffer if an African American or Latino family were to move in next door. There would be more crime, because, well, you know how those people are. But don\u2019t worry. Barack Obama wanted to make you let them in, but I\u2019ll keep them out.\n\nAt a moment when the Black Lives Matter protests have sparked a debate on how to eradicate systemic racism, Trump vows to keep it alive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis attack on desegregation should come as no surprise. Trump\u2019s first appearance in the public eye came in 1973, when he, his father and their real estate company were sued by the Justice Department for refusing to rent apartments to African Americans. Rather than quietly reach a settlement, as other developers had done, the Trumps filed a ridiculous $100 million countersuit and accused the federal government of forcing them to accept \u201cwelfare recipients\u201d as tenants. In the end, the Trumps agreed to a consent decree in which they promised to stop discriminating against minorities without admitting they had been doing so.\n\nThis racist mind-set about housing is fully in keeping with the tenor of his inflame-the-base reelection campaign, in which he has demonized racial-justice protesters as \u201canarchists\u201d and \u201cagitators\u201d while cheering, for example, the White couple in St. Louis who pointed guns at demonstrators marching past.\n\nTrump\u2019s reflexively racist views might not have changed over the years. But the nation has.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor one thing, the suburbs are far from lily-white. According to studies by the Brookings Institution, the racial demographics of America\u2019s suburbs now roughly mirror those of the nation as a whole. In some metropolitan areas, more African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans are \u201cliving their Suburban Lifestyle Dream\u201d (as Trump put it) than are living in the core cities.\n\nAt the same time, however, patterns of racial segregation in housing persist, including in many suburbs. Segregation in housing leads to segregation in schools, which helps perpetuate structural disparities. The fact that a given house in a White suburban neighborhood tends to be assessed at a higher value than an identical house in a comparable African American neighborhood helps maintain the massive wealth gap between Black and White people. A serious federal effort to \u201caffirmatively\u201d reduce segregation would help lessen inequality.\n\nMost Americans see this as a moment of racial reckoning, according to polls. Trump has also fallen behind with suburban voters, who have become a key electoral bellwether. In response, Trump promises his followers a return to the racial caste system that stratified the nation before the civil rights movement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt least the president is up front about all of this. The Republican Party cannot pretend there is anything at work here other than old-fashioned racism. Those who support Trump\u2019s reelection must also support, and cheer, his adamant refusal to enforce a landmark piece of civil rights legislation.

They ultimately were not included in the $2.2tn final package, which included only $400m to states to help them run elections.\n\n\u201cThe things they had in there were crazy.

A recent document from the Postal Service, obtained by The Associated Press, described the need for an \u201coperational pivot\u201d to make the cash-strapped agency financially stable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just asinine to think that you can shut something down or throttle it back in terms of the pandemic when basically the lifeline for voting and democracy is going to be in the hands of the Postal Service,\u201d Manchin, a Democrat, told reporters Wednesday.\n\nHe said at least two post offices in West Virginia had been scheduled to close next month but that the agency had \u201cslowed\u201d its plans.\n\nA spokesman for the Postal Service referred questions to a prior statement from DeJoy, which said the agency \u201chas experienced over a decade of financial losses, with no end in sight, and we face an impending liquidity crisis.\u201d The statement goes on to say that \u201cit is critical that the Postal Service take a fresh look at our operations and make necessary adjustments.\u201d\n\nMark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents more than 200,000 postal workers and retirees, said there\u2019s \u201cdefinitely buzz\u201d about closures although he said he was not aware of specific details. A representative for the union said rank-and-file postal employees have been told by managers that their offices are being targeted for potential cutbacks.\n\n\u201cThe logical conclusion is that he\u2019s going to try to close some post offices,\u201d Dimondstein said of the postmaster general\u2019s belt-tightening strategies.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has created further strain on Postal Service finances. The service reported a $4.5 billion loss for the quarter ending in March, before the full effects of the shutdown sank in.\n\nManchin\u2019s letter noted that the coronavirus relief package passed by Congress in March included authorization for the agency to borrow up to $10 billion from the U.S. Treasury. The money was intended to help the Postal Service maintain essential services during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, not only has little to none of that funding been utilized, you are now proposing the very cuts that we sought to avoid with that emergency line of credit,\u201d Manchin said in his letter.\n\nLater Wednesday, Treasury announced it had reached agreement with the Postal Service on the terms of any future borrowing but also said the service was able to fund its operations at this time without using a loan.", "link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/postal-service-may-close-offices-cut-service-ahead-of-election-2020-07-29", "author": ["Associated Press"]}, {"title": "Postal Service memos detail \u2018difficult\u2019 changes, including slower mail delivery", "text": "Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told employees to leave mail behind at distribution centers if it delayed letter carriers from their routes, according to internal USPS documents obtained by The Washington Post and verified by the American Postal Workers Union and three people with knowledge of their contents, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution.\n\n\u201cIf the plants run late, they will keep the mail for the next day,\u201d according to a document titled, \u201cNew PMG\u2019s [Postmaster General\u2019s] expectations and plan.\u201d Traditionally, postal workers are trained not to leave letters behind and to make multiple delivery trips to ensure timely distribution of letters and parcels.\n\nThe memo cited U.S. Steel, a onetime industry titan that was slow to adapt to market changes, to illustrate what is at stake. \u201cIn 1975 they were the largest company in the world,\u201d the memo states. \u201cThey are gone.\u201d (U.S. Steel is a $1.7 billion company with 27,500 employees.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnalysts say the documents present a stark reimagining of the USPS that could chase away customers \u2014 especially if the White House gets the steep package rate increases it wants \u2014 and put the already beleaguered agency in deeper financial peril as private-sector competitors embark on hiring sprees to build out their own delivery networks.\n\nCongress authorized the USPS to borrow an additional $10 billion from the Treasury Department for emergency operations in an early coronavirus relief bill. But postal leaders have yet to access the money over disagreements with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who attached terms on the loan that would turn over operations of much of the Postal Service to his department.\n\nThe Postal Service\u2019s governing board appointed DeJoy, a major Trump donor and seasoned logistics executive, in the middle of that back-and-forth.\n\nSteep drop-offs in first-class and marketing mail, the Postal Service\u2019s most profitable items, have exacerbated the USPS\u2019s cash crisis; postal leaders predicted at the start of the pandemic that their agency would be insolvent by October without congressional intervention. Single-piece, first-class mail volume fell 15 to 20 percent week to week in April and May, agency leaders told lawmakers last month. Marketing mail, the hardest-hit segment, tumbled 30 to 50 percent week to week during the same period.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSkyrocketing package volume, up 60 to 80 percent in May as the coronavirus pandemic made consumers more reliant on delivery services, has propped up the Postal Service\u2019s finances and staved off immediate financial calamity. But the packages also have intensified the USPS\u2019s competition with Amazon, FedEx and UPS, industry leaders looking to capitalize on enduring changes in consumer habits brought on by shelter-in-place orders. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nThe Trump administration has consolidated control over the Postal Service, traditionally an apolitical institution, during the pandemic by making a financial lifeline for the nation\u2019s mail service contingent upon the White House political agenda. President Trump in April called the agency \u201ca joke\u201d and demanded it quadruple package rates before he\u2019d authorize any emergency aid or loans.\n\nThe Postal Service\u2019s future needs to be as a low-cost package carrier, industry analysts contend, as parcels make up a growing portion of the agency\u2019s volume and profits, and paper mail volumes continue to decline as coupons and bills increasingly move online. Postal leaders project the agency could run out of money between March and October 2021.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf this is true, it would be a real concern to customers if service were slowed, especially in light of the fact that the Postal Service may get more rate authority, meaning higher rates, later this year or early next year,\u201d said Art Sackler, manager of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, an industry group whose members include Amazon, eBay and other commercial mailers.\n\n\u201cThis is framing the U.S. Postal Service, a 245-year-old government agency, and comparing it to its competitors that could conceivably go bankrupt,\u201d said Philip Rubio, a professor of history at North Carolina A&T State University and a former postal worker. \u201cComparing it to U.S. Steel says exactly that \u2018We are a business, not service.\u2019 That\u2019s troubling.\u201d\n\nThe changes also worry vote-by-mail advocates, who insist that any policy that slows delivery could imperil access to mailed and absentee ballots. It reinforces the need, they say, for Congress to provide the agency emergency coronavirus funding.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAttacks on USPS not only threaten our economy and the jobs of 600,000 workers. With our states now reliant on mail voting to continue elections during the pandemic, the destabilizing of the post office is a direct attack on American democracy itself,\u201d said Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. (D-N.J.). \u201cIt has been 59 days since the House passed $25 billion to keep USPS alive. The Senate must pass it now. Democracy hangs in the balance.\u201d\n\nThe Postal Service said in a statement that it was \u201cdeveloping a business plan to ensure that we will be financially stable and able to continue to provide reliable, affordable, safe and secure delivery of mail, packages and other communications to all Americans as a vital part of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIt said the plan was not finalized, but would include \u201cnew and creative ways for us to fulfill our mission, and we will focus immediately on efficiency and items that we can control, including adherence to the effective operating plans that we have developed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the documents circulated Monday on shop floors around the country called for specific changes in the way postal workers will do their jobs.\n\n\u201cEvery single employee will receive this information, no matter what job they perform, so remember that YOU are an integral part of the success we will have \u2014 again, by working together,\u201d the second document states.\n\n\u201cThe shifts are simple, but they will be challenging, as we seek to change our culture and move away from past practices previously used,\u201d it adds.\n\nThe first memo says the agency will prohibit overtime and strictly curtail the use of other measures local postmasters use to ameliorate staffing shortages.\n\nAD\n\nEven a common method for mail delivery \u2014 \u201cpark points,\u201d in which letter carriers park their mail trucks at the end of a street, deliver mail items by foot for several blocks, then return to the trucks and drive on \u2014 is under scrutiny. The document bans carriers from taking more than four \u201cpark points\u201d on their routes and claims \u201cpark points are abused, not cost effective and taken advantage of.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a riot act,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOvertime is being used because people need their packages in this pandemic,\u201d said Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents 200,000 USPS employees. \u201cThey need their mail in this pandemic. They need their medicines in this pandemic. They need their census forms. They need ballot information.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe second memo says the Postal Service will first look to cut its transportation costs, and estimates that late and extra trips cost the agency $200 million annually in \u201cadded expenses,\u201d or about the same amount the agency lost in May. The memo warns postal workers that it may be \u201cdifficult\u201d to \u201csee mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor,\u201d but that the agency \u201cwill address root causes of these delays and adjust the very next day.\u201d\n\nPostal union leaders condemned the measures and said customer service is being sacrificed for only meager cost savings.", "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/14/postal-service-trump-dejoy-delay-mail/", "author": ["Jacob Bogage", "National Sports Writer"]}, {"title": "Underwood: Guam needs more action on military issues", "text": "Pacific Daily News\n\nDemocratic congressional candidate Robert Underwood said Guam needs to be more involved with military spending on island, something he said hasn't happened during Del.

Scott Fitzgerald. \"The clerks of this state should stand ready to proceed with the election. The governor's executive order is clearly an unconstitutional overreach.\"\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court, whose political balance at the time leaned 5-2 in favor of conservative justices, ruled 4-2 that the April 7 election must go on.

The trials mentioned in the tweet were for late-stage disease and often utilized exceptionally high doses with the potential for toxicity. The FDA eliminated compassionate use for late-stage COVID-19.

Some states have used less than 5 percent of the funds earmarked for them, including states like New Jersey and Connecticut, which bore the brunt of early coronavirus cases.\n\nThe surprising revelation complicates states\u2019 claims that they need a hundred-billion-dollar federal bailout to ensure their solvency in the coming months. The question of what money, if any, states should receive in the next round of coronavirus stimulus is likely to be a subject of hot debate in coming weeks, and the inspector general\u2019s report challenges Democrats\u2019 contention that more money is needed, particularly compared with Republicans\u2019 proposal to free up preexisting and evidently unused funds.\n\nThe data indicate that the coronavirus relief fund is heavily undersubscribed throughout the country. Just three states\u2014California, New York, and Colorado\u2014have used more than half of the funds allocated to their state and local governments. By contrast, 23 states have used less than 10 percent of their funding, while 11 have used less than half. Of the nearly $2 billion earmarked for South Carolina, the state reports using just $763,000.\n\nMoney available through the coronavirus relief fund was disbursed based on population, with a floor allocation of $1.25 billion per state. Some locales that were heavily hit by the coronavirus appear to have used funds extensively\u2014New York City, for example, has used 99.4 percent of its money\u2014but others, like New Jersey and Connecticut, have not.\n\nThe funds are earmarked exclusively for use on public health issues\u2014a subject of contention, as many states see the impending fiscal meltdown instigated by the current recession as an even bigger challenge than the coronavirus itself. The National Governors Association has asked for $500 billion in the next round of coronavirus stimulus.\n\nDemocrats want to give it to them\u2014Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D., Calif.) proposal for the latest round of relief includes $540 billion for a state-and-local bailout. But Republicans are more wary, fearing that federal bailout dollars will be used to shore up flagging state pensions already almost bankrupted by years of malinvestment.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s solution to this problem, unveiled Monday evening, is to remove the requirement that the Coronavirus Relief Fund only be used for public health issues\u2014thereby freeing up an apparently undersubscribed source of funding without committing to more spending on top of what already appeared in the CARES Act.\n\nWhether or not to provide the states with general funding, and how much of it, is likely to be a major subject of dispute in this week\u2019s congressional negotiations over another round of coronavirus stimulus. That will add to disagreements over unemployment insurance and the rapidly increasing size of the federal deficit. The result is likely to be the most acrimonious round of negotiation yet.\n\nVia FreeBeacon", "link": "https://en-volve.com/2020/07/30/report-reveals-states-have-hardly-spent-any-of-the-150-billion-in-covid-funds/", "author": []}, {"title": "Bill de Blasio Takes A Break From Destroying NYC To Paint Yet ANOTHER BLM Mural On The Streets", "text": "You'll only get the best stuff we have!\n\nBill de Blasio, the ineffectual and spineless mayor of New York City, has taken more time out from doing absolutely nothing to combat the skyrocketing crime in his city to help paint yet another meaningless Black Lives Matter mural on the streets.\n\nde Blasio was certainly trolling the president when he pitched in to paint Black Lives Matter in huge yellow letters on Fifth Avenue in front of Trump Tower, but that was the second mural in the city; the first one was painted on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, and de Blasio declared that the block would become pedestrian-only for the summer, apparently to preserve the mural from tire tracks.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio helped paint a new Black Lives Matter mural in front of the Family Court on Jamaica Avenue in Queens Thursday afternoon. https://t.co/tVTmmg1n7r July 30, 2020\n\nHe\u2019d also said that he was going to rename a street in each borough to honor Black Lives Matter, but we\u2019re not sure how that project\u2019s going.\n\nDe Blasio paints another Black Lives Matter mural, as shootings plague NYC https://t.co/6a6e20VmMA pic.twitter.com/J4uGumoeCJ \u2014 New York Post (@nypost) July 30, 2020\n\nKhristina Narizhnaya and Julia Marsh report:\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio rolled up his shirtsleeves to paint another Black Lives Matter mural on a city street Thursday, but offered no solutions to tackle rising crime as 10 more New Yorkers were shot in The Bronx, Manhattan and Brooklyn in just the last two days. \u2026 The mural painting was the only public event on Hizzoner\u2019s public schedule Thursday aside from his daily press briefing where he failed to even mention the 10 people shot in eight incidents across the city Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe mayor sure does love his murals.", "link": "https://en-volve.com/2020/07/30/bill-de-blasio-takes-a-break-from-destroying-nyc-to-paint-yet-another-blm-mural-on-the-streets/", "author": []}, {"title": "WATCH: Speaker At BLM Rally Tells Crowd That White People Are The ENEMY", "text": "When the BLM crowd takes offense to the term \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d it\u2019s not because they think it\u2019s \u201cracist\u201d.

But what we are seeing today is next-level stuff, and unlike in previous instances of history, there is no cultural or national commonality anymore to hold things together.

Here\u2019s How to Know If It\u2019s for You", "text": "So you\u2019ve probably heard about the term \u201ccasual dating\u201d a lot from either friends or one of those top online dating sites where you can find people with the same goal. Meet Russian ladies on a Russian dating site may seem exciting for you. But what exactly is \u201ccasual dating\u201d anyway? And is it something for you?\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in this activity, here are a few tips to know if it\u2019s for you.\n\nWhat Is Casual Dating?\n\nYou must first know what it is. In the traditional dating scene, you have an end goal. Your end goal is to know whether or not a woman you\u2019re dating is girlfriend material or even marriage material. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re into blonde Russian women, but you don\u2019t know whether or not you can have a serious relationship with one. Traditional dating helps you find that out.\n\nCasual dating is a whole different thing.\n\nWith casual dating, there really is no end goal. There\u2019s no testing whether or not your date is suitable as a wife or not. Your purpose is to simply enjoy yourself in the company of another person of the opposite sex. So going back to the previous example, instead of dating hot Russian girls to know if you can be in a relationship with one of them, you\u2019re simply dating to have fun.\n\nIs Casual Dating for Me?\n\nNow that you know what casual dating is in a nutshell, you probably have a small idea about whether it is for you or not. In the event, it\u2019s really good to have a checklist to know if casual dating suits your own emotional needs. You can use this checklist:\n\nHonesty\n\nFirst, you have to be honest with the women you\u2019re dating. You have to tell them in advance that you just want something casual so that they also don\u2019t think that you\u2019re seriously considering a relationship. That\u2019s why dating websites are really helpful when wanting to hook up. Take Russian women dating sites for instance. If you want to meet women who are gorgeous in Russian dating websites, you need to be upfront about what you are looking for in a woman. You can even see real Russian ladies photos to know if you want to get to know them or not. You can skip all the games and get right to the business. In any case, you also have to be honest about what you want since these women also don\u2019t want to play games.\n\nNo Emotional Attachment\n\nAnother thing that you have to know is whether or not you can avoid creating emotional attachments. With casual dating, you just want to have fun to stimulate your mental and physical needs. It\u2019s okay to have some sort of an emotional bond with the woman you\u2019re dating, but emotional attachments will make you not want to date anyone else\u2013 and that\u2019s no longer casual dating. So if you want to just stick to casual dating, ask yourself if you can take not having emotional attachments.\n\nNo Exclusivity\n\nWith casual dating, there is no exclusivity for both you and your date. Unless otherwise specified, you two are not exclusive and are free to date whoever you want. Now, this is a rather sensitive issue as it doesn\u2019t only evolve the two of you but even other people you two may want to date. You must ask yourself if you\u2019re the type to get jealous if you know your date is happy with someone else. If you are, then you may want to reconsider casual dating. If you\u2019re okay with that setup, then try it out.\n\nBoundaries\n\nLastly, you have to know whether you can list some boundaries with your date or not. With casual dating, you need those boundaries so that you and your date won\u2019t have any disagreements. It\u2019s better that you set those at the onset, especially if you\u2019re using a dating website. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re looking for dates in polish dating websites. It\u2019s best to already set the boundaries during the first DM if you and your potential date are interested in each other.\n\nWhy Online Dating Works Great for Casual Dating?\n\nWe\u2019ve mentioned using dating apps quite a number of times while going through the checklist. This is because online dating apps and websites are very helpful making sure that a casual date goes well. It matches you with someone you\u2019re compatible with and with someone who has the same purpose as you. It\u2019s like getting a Russian mail order bride but strictly for casual dating.\n\nConclusion\n\nFor those considering casual dating through online dating websites or dating apps, these are the things you need to ask yourself. If you can tick Yes for everything in the checklist, then you\u2019re ready. If not, then you best stick to traditional dating instead.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re clear in your purpose of casual dating and if you can take it, then you should have no problems at all.\n\nEnjoy getting back in the playing field!", "link": "https://www.bestbrides.net/interested-in-casual-russian-dating-site-heres-how-to-know-if-its-for-you/", "author": ["Kevin Waston"]}, {"title": "JUST THE FACTS: U.S. Sees Lowest COVID Death Count Since March!", "text": "You'll only get the best stuff we have!\n\nThe past few months of the coronavirus pandemic have been a master class in how legacy media manipulate numbers to stoke fear. Case in point: Have you heard that on Sunday, the United States reported its lowest single-day death count in three months?\n\nYou probably have not, but it is true, according to a website tracking COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe \u201cDaily Deaths\u201d chart at Worldometer shows the dramatic decline: The 267 coronavirus deaths recorded Sunday were less than half the total of the previous day (573) and the fewest since March 23, when the site listed a total of 180 deaths.\n\nBut if you are watching CNN, you are only hearing more panic and fear, with headlines highlighting worries about the increased spread of the virus.\n\nThis is what the network reported Monday: \u201cParts of Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, Texas and other states \u2014 many of which were some of the first to reopen following shutdowns \u2014 have reported that new coronavirus cases are being diagnosed in increasingly younger populations.\u201d\n\nNote the way CNN highlighted states that reopened earlier than others. The dominating narrative in the mainstream media is that there are a lot of red states with spiking COVID-19 case numbers.\n\nOf course, as more people get tested, more cases will appear. But if deaths and hospitalizations are declining, our country is headed in the right direction.\n\nAshish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that younger people who get sick \u201chave parents. They have grandparents, and they are going to go see those people. \u2026 The more the virus spreads, the more everybody is vulnerable.\u201d\n\nHere is what Jha did not tell the audience: Vulnerable populations in states such as Florida have not died from the virus at the rates of those in Democrat-run states such as New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because Republican governors such as Ron DeSantis in Florida and Brian Kemp in Georgia moved fast and efficiently to protect the elderly in nursing homes. Kemp even had the Georgia National Guard send infection-control teams to nursing homes around the state early on to help limit the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWhile those states were ensuring that nursing homes had the protective equipment and training they needed, New York\u2019s Democratic leaders forced nursing homes to take in COVID-infected patients.\n\nThe result is that New York and New Jersey have the highest COVID-19 death rates in the country, according to Worldometer: 1,609 and 1,472, respectively, per million population, as of Monday.\n\nConversely, Florida has a much lower death rate despite its large elderly population: 152 deaths per million population. The difference in reporting on these matters led DeSantis to speak out about how the media has manipulated the Wuhan virus narrative in the U.S.\n\nWhile leftists initially tried to come up with conspiracy theories as to why states that opened early did not become apocalyptic in the aftermath, they are now reduced to trying to stoke new fears.\n\nSo don\u2019t expect the establishment media to talk about the declining deaths from coronavirus. Good news for the nation is bad news for Democrats, after all.\n\nSadly, if you have friends or relatives who rely solely on CNN or other leftist outlets for their information, they likely will not hear anything about a drop in COVID-19 deaths.\n\nThe establishment media do not care about giving Americans the truth. They care about keeping the coronavirus panic alive until the November election.\n\nVia WesterJournal", "link": "https://en-volve.com/2020/06/27/just-the-facts-u-s-sees-lowest-covid-death-count-since-march/#comment-575582", "author": []}, {"title": "DEFUND Universities!

He described the Klan as \u201can \u2018Invisible Empire of the South,\u2019 bound together in loose organization to protect the southern country from some of the ugliest hazards of a time of revolution.\u201d In reality, the KKK was a violent terrorist group that targeted Black Americans. Confederate veterans founded the paramilitary group after the Civil War ended in 1865. The first wave of the KKK only disbanded in the early 1870s after President Ulysses S. Grant pushed through laws allowing him to go after it with military force. White historians like Wilson helped popularize the Confederate Klansmen, who became the heroes of D.W. Griffith\u2019s 1915 film The Birth of a Nation. The movie\u2019s villains were Black Americans portrayed by white actors in blackface. Wilson agreed to screen the film\u2014which quoted his own book in its title cards\u2014at the White House.\n\nThe KKK marched in Washington DC during Wilson\u2019s presidency.", "link": "https://en-volve.com/2020/07/22/senile-joe-biden-smears-president-trump-as-first-racist-president-completely-ignoring-racist-history-of-democrat-party/", "author": []}, {"title": "The MSM Reported Sexual Assault Claims Against Tucker Carlson And Hannity And They Are HILARIOUSLY Frivolous", "text": "You'll only get the best stuff we have!\n\nGet the best Trump news straight to your inbox!\n\nOn Monday night top talent at FOX News were mentioned in a lawsuit by former employee Jennifer Eckhart and frequent guest Cathy Areu.

Cory Booker and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee have introduced legislation to create a commission, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act.\n\nIn introducing her bill to the House last year, Jackson Lee said, \u201cThe commission aims to study the impact of slavery and continuing discrimination against African-Americans, resulting directly and indirectly from slavery to segregation to the desegregation process and the present day. The commission would also make recommendations concerning any form of apology and compensation to begin the long delayed process of atonement for slavery.\u201d\n\nSince then, reparations have continued to draw attention, and the issue was elevated further during the recent Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nLong at the center of the debate has been the potential price tag of paying slavery descendants, for which studies broadly include most or all of the 41 million black people in the country.\n\nA new study from three college professors said that the ultimate cost could be $6.2 quadrillion.

One protester appears to pull a gun from his pocket before taking aim at the driver\u2019s window before firing.\n\nAt that moment, protesters disperse and cars drive around the truck which came to a standstill for over two minutes before driving away.\n\nPruitt managed to drive for around a mile to look for a nearby hospital. Authorities found Pruitt alert\u2013with a bullet lodged in his brain.\n\nSome protesters claim that the disabled vet had plowed into the crowd before the shooting took place. However, authorities were unable to find any conclusive evidence to support the claims.\n\nA Go Fund Me\u2013which has raised over $100,000\u2013was set up to support Pruitt following the shooting.\n\nOn the description, the crowdfunding page, set up by Pruitt\u2019s niece, reads:\n\nThis is Danny Pruitt. On Thursday, June 4th 2020, Danny was on his way to get dinner, when the roadway was blocked by protesters. One protester decided to make a calculated decision, shooting through Danny\u2019s driver side window, the bullet hitting Danny in the back of the head. Danny tried to drive away, Danny tried to make it to the hospital. He was scared for his life. Only making it about a mile from the scene. Before he fell unresponsive. Officers of Alamosa Police Department were able to locate Danny. He was taken by ambulance to San Luis Valley Health, and was later care flighted to UCHealth Memorial Hospital in Colorado Springs. Where he is currently in critical condition and fighting for his life. With a bullet lodged in his brain. Danny is on life support. Danny Pruitt is a single father, of a little girl. He is one of the best fathers I have come to know. I can say without a doubt the reason he is fighting so hard, is because of his little girl. Danny Pruitt is a disabled veteran. This fund is for his needs and for his young daughter. Any amount of money you can donate to this family will be greatly appreciated. Please pray for Danny and his family, help him to keep fighting. So his little girl might, one day, have her daddy back.\n\nAccording to an update on Pruitt\u2019s Go Fund Me page, the disabled vet appears to be recovering from his traumatic injury.\n\nHe has a drain in his head for the fluid, to hopefully reduce the swelling on his brain. I have been told he is in stable condition as of now. But the doctor said we won\u2019t know much more until next week. They are going to see how he does, see how much swelling will go down in that period of time. I am sorry I don\u2019t have more than that. It\u2019s just a waiting game right now. They are still running a lot of tests. If I hear anymore I will update everyone promptly. I\u2019ve been told with traumatic brain injuries there are not always frequent changes.

Some believe the city is the first in the U.S. with a Muslim majority on its city council. Four of the six council members will be Muslim: three of them of Bangladeshi descent and one Yemeni. \u201cHamtramck has made history,\u201d said Hamtramck community leader Bill Meyer. \u201cThe election was far from close, with the three Muslim winners each gaining over 1,000 votes, while the other three candidates garnered less than 700 votes each.\u201d Councilman Musa, who came in second place, told the Free Press that he will work to represent everyone in the city regardless of background. \u201cI\u2019m a very good Muslim,\u201d said Musa, an immigrant from Bangladesh. \u201cI try my best to pray five times (a day), but when I get elected, every single ethnic votes for me, not (only) the Muslim vote for me, but Christians, every single ethnic group, African-Americans, Polish. I\u2019m a good friend of the Polish.\u201d \u201cI represent every single citizen in Hamtramck,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m serving all city of Hamtramck.\u201d Formerly known for its Polish population, Hamtramck is now about 24% Arab (mostly Yemeni); 19% African American; 15% Bangladeshi; 12% Polish; and 6% Yugoslavian (many Bosnian), according to U.S. Census figures. The percentage of residents who are Muslim is unclear since the U.S. Census does not ask about religion. Estimates of the Muslim population range from one-third to more than one-half of city residents. Almost all of the Yemeni Americans in Hamtramck are Muslim, while the growing Bangaldeshi-American community in Hamtramck has Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The city has a Bangladeshi Hindu temple and Bangladeshi mosques. On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder attended the opening of Bangla Town, an area that will celebrate Bangladeshi-American culture in Hamtramck and bordering Detroit neighborhoods. About 41% of the city are immigrants, the highest percentage among cities in metro Detroit. Pope John Paul II, who was Polish, visited Hamtramck in 1987; a statue of him commemorating his visit is in a city park. Three of the Muslims on Hamtramck\u2019s City Council are of Bangladeshi descent, while Almasmari is of Yemeni descent. The council\u2019s only other Arab-American Muslim in its history was Abdul Algazali, who died in February. The issue of Islam has sometimes come up in recent years as the Muslim population grows. After contentious debate, the city allowed in 2004 the Muslim call to prayer to be broadcast publicly five times a day from mosques through loudspeakers. The call to prayer has drawn complaints from residents who say it\u2019s loud and intrusive, waking them up early and bothering them. City Council candidate Susan Dunn, who came in fourth place, raised the issue during the campaign, prompting a response from Almasmari during a city council meeting last month. \u201cWe all want to live peacefully and respectfully,\u201d he said to the council during the October meeting, according to a video he posted to his Facebook account. \u201cOur special thing is \u2026 the diversity in this town.\u201d Almasmari said the call to prayer \u201cis not as loud as (Dunn) thinks.\u201d Moreover, if \u201cwe are considering the call to prayer as noise,\u201d then so would \u201cthe loud music all night long while we are sleeping.\u201d \u201cWe as Muslims respect our neighbors and we don\u2019t like to bother anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the Prophet Mohammed said: he who believes in Allah and the last day, let him not harm his neighbors.\u201d Meyer, who is not Muslim, said that Muslims in Hamtramck \u201chave helped bring stability, security and sobriety while lessening the amount of drugs and crime in the city.\u201d\n\nIf they are in Michigan legally they need to follow our laws. THEY NEED TO BECOME CITIZENS.AND RENOUNCE THEIR COUNTRY. WE WANT OUR LAWS NOT SHARIA LAW. IF YOU WANT TO LIVE HERE LIVE BY OUR LAWS.DON\u2019T LIVE BEHIND COVERED FACES.

It\u2019s all starting to unravel for the Obama administration and it was only a matter of time until it\u2019s deception and unscrupulous behavior were uncovered!\n\nA new Circa report has revealed that previously top secret documents show that President Barack Obama for years.\n\nThese classified documents show that under former President Barack Obama, the National Security Agency (NSA) routinely violated American privacy protections while scouring through overseas intercepts and failed to disclose the extent of the problems until the final days before Donald Trump was elected president last fall.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) claim these newly disclosed violations rank as some of the most serious to ever be documented.\n\nNeema Singh Guliani, the ACLU\u2019s legislative counsel in Washington, said: \u201cI think what this emphasizes is the shocking lack of oversight of these programs.\u201d\n\nThe normally supportive court censured administration officials, saying the failure to disclose the extent of the violations earlier amounted to an \u201cinstitutional lack of candor\u201d and that the improper searches constituted a \u201cvery serious Fourth Amendment issue,\u201d according to a recently unsealed court document dated April 26, 2017.\n\nCirca has reported that there was a three-fold increase in NSA data searches about Americans and a rise in the unmasking of U.S. person\u2019s identities in intelligence reports after Obama loosened the privacy rules in 2011.\n\nOfficials like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice have argued their activities were legal under the so-called minimization rule changes Obama made, and that the intelligence agencies were strictly monitored to avoid abuses.\n\nEarlier this month, Senator Rand Paul claimed that he and another Senator may have been under surveillance by the former administration.\n\n\u201cI know one other senator who\u2019s already confided to me that he was surveilled by the Obama administration, including his phone calls,\u201d Paul told Fox News.\n\nThis Wednesday, speaking on Fox News he said there was an apparent effort under the Obama Administration to increase the number of unmaskings of Americans.\n\nPaul said: \u201cIf we determine this to be true, this is an enormous abuse of power/ This will dwarf all other stories.\u201d There are hundreds and hundreds of people\u201d: Paul added.\n\nLeftist American Civil Liberties Union has also blasted the report, with the ACLU\u2019s legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani stating: \u201cI think what this emphasizes is the shocking lack of oversight of these programs. You have these problems going on for years that only come to the attention of the court late in the game and then it takes additional years to change its practices.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI think it does call into question all those defenses that we kept hearing, that we always have a robust oversight structure and we have a culture of adherence to privacy standards. And the headline now is they actually haven\u2019t been in compliance for years and the FISA court itself says in its opinion is that the NSA suffers from a culture of a lack of candor.\u201d\n\nIt is so obvious that Obama violated every law in the book. If we are still a nation of laws then something needs to be done about this illegal activities very soon!\n\nNo matter if you are wealthy and powerful\u2026 the same rules must apply to everybody who breaks the law!", "link": "https://www.usasupreme.com/classified-documents-show-obamas-nsa-illegally-spied-americans-years/", "author": ["Natalie D.", "Natalie D.

It\u2019s all starting to unravel for the Obama administration and it was only a matter of time until it\u2019s deception and unscrupulous behavior were uncovered!\n\nA new Circa report has revealed that previously top secret documents show that President Barack Obama for years.\n\nThese classified documents show that under former President Barack Obama, the National Security Agency (NSA) routinely violated American privacy protections while scouring through overseas intercepts and failed to disclose the extent of the problems until the final days before Donald Trump was elected president last fall.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) claim these newly disclosed violations rank as some of the most serious to ever be documented.\n\nNeema Singh Guliani, the ACLU\u2019s legislative counsel in Washington, said: \u201cI think what this emphasizes is the shocking lack of oversight of these programs.\u201d\n\nThe normally supportive court censured administration officials, saying the failure to disclose the extent of the violations earlier amounted to an \u201cinstitutional lack of candor\u201d and that the improper searches constituted a \u201cvery serious Fourth Amendment issue,\u201d according to a recently unsealed court document dated April 26, 2017.\n\nCirca has reported that there was a three-fold increase in NSA data searches about Americans and a rise in the unmasking of U.S. person\u2019s identities in intelligence reports after Obama loosened the privacy rules in 2011.\n\nOfficials like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice have argued their activities were legal under the so-called minimization rule changes Obama made, and that the intelligence agencies were strictly monitored to avoid abuses.\n\nEarlier this month, Senator Rand Paul claimed that he and another Senator may have been under surveillance by the former administration.\n\n\u201cI know one other senator who\u2019s already confided to me that he was surveilled by the Obama administration, including his phone calls,\u201d Paul told Fox News.\n\nThis Wednesday, speaking on Fox News he said there was an apparent effort under the Obama Administration to increase the number of unmaskings of Americans.\n\nPaul said: \u201cIf we determine this to be true, this is an enormous abuse of power/ This will dwarf all other stories.\u201d There are hundreds and hundreds of people\u201d: Paul added.\n\nLeftist American Civil Liberties Union has also blasted the report, with the ACLU\u2019s legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani stating: \u201cI think what this emphasizes is the shocking lack of oversight of these programs. You have these problems going on for years that only come to the attention of the court late in the game and then it takes additional years to change its practices.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI think it does call into question all those defenses that we kept hearing, that we always have a robust oversight structure and we have a culture of adherence to privacy standards. And the headline now is they actually haven\u2019t been in compliance for years and the FISA court itself says in its opinion is that the NSA suffers from a culture of a lack of candor.\u201d\n\nIt is so obvious that Obama violated every law in the book. If we are still a nation of laws then something needs to be done about this illegal activities very soon!\n\nNo matter if you are wealthy and powerful\u2026 the same rules must apply to everybody who breaks the law!", "link": "https://www.usasupreme.com/classified-documents-show-obamas-nsa-illegally-spied-americans-years/#comments", "author": ["Natalie D.", "Natalie D.

In Tuesday\u2019s election \u2014 with six candidates running for three seats \u2014 the top three vote-getters were Muslim, while the bottom three were non-Muslim. Two of the Muslim candidates, Anam Miah and Abu Musa, are incumbent city councilmen, while newcomer Saad Almasmari, the top vote-getter, also was elected. The seat of another Muslim incumbent councilman, Mohammed Hassan, was not up for re-election, and incumbent City Councilman Robert Zwolak came in fifth place. Some believe the city is the first in the U.S. with a Muslim majority on its city council. Four of the six council members will be Muslim: three of them of Bangladeshi descent and one Yemeni. \u201cHamtramck has made history,\u201d said Hamtramck community leader Bill Meyer. \u201cThe election was far from close, with the three Muslim winners each gaining over 1,000 votes, while the other three candidates garnered less than 700 votes each.\u201d Councilman Musa, who came in second place, told the Free Press that he will work to represent everyone in the city regardless of background. \u201cI\u2019m a very good Muslim,\u201d said Musa, an immigrant from Bangladesh. \u201cI try my best to pray five times (a day), but when I get elected, every single ethnic votes for me, not (only) the Muslim vote for me, but Christians, every single ethnic group, African-Americans, Polish. I\u2019m a good friend of the Polish.\u201d \u201cI represent every single citizen in Hamtramck,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m serving all city of Hamtramck.\u201d Formerly known for its Polish population, Hamtramck is now about 24% Arab (mostly Yemeni); 19% African American; 15% Bangladeshi; 12% Polish; and 6% Yugoslavian (many Bosnian), according to U.S. Census figures. The percentage of residents who are Muslim is unclear since the U.S. Census does not ask about religion. Estimates of the Muslim population range from one-third to more than one-half of city residents. Almost all of the Yemeni Americans in Hamtramck are Muslim, while the growing Bangaldeshi-American community in Hamtramck has Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The city has a Bangladeshi Hindu temple and Bangladeshi mosques. On Friday, Gov. Rick Snyder attended the opening of Bangla Town, an area that will celebrate Bangladeshi-American culture in Hamtramck and bordering Detroit neighborhoods. About 41% of the city are immigrants, the highest percentage among cities in metro Detroit. Pope John Paul II, who was Polish, visited Hamtramck in 1987; a statue of him commemorating his visit is in a city park. Three of the Muslims on Hamtramck\u2019s City Council are of Bangladeshi descent, while Almasmari is of Yemeni descent. The council\u2019s only other Arab-American Muslim in its history was Abdul Algazali, who died in February. The issue of Islam has sometimes come up in recent years as the Muslim population grows. After contentious debate, the city allowed in 2004 the Muslim call to prayer to be broadcast publicly five times a day from mosques through loudspeakers. The call to prayer has drawn complaints from residents who say it\u2019s loud and intrusive, waking them up early and bothering them. City Council candidate Susan Dunn, who came in fourth place, raised the issue during the campaign, prompting a response from Almasmari during a city council meeting last month. \u201cWe all want to live peacefully and respectfully,\u201d he said to the council during the October meeting, according to a video he posted to his Facebook account. \u201cOur special thing is \u2026 the diversity in this town.\u201d Almasmari said the call to prayer \u201cis not as loud as (Dunn) thinks.\u201d Moreover, if \u201cwe are considering the call to prayer as noise,\u201d then so would \u201cthe loud music all night long while we are sleeping.\u201d \u201cWe as Muslims respect our neighbors and we don\u2019t like to bother anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the Prophet Mohammed said: he who believes in Allah and the last day, let him not harm his neighbors.\u201d Meyer, who is not Muslim, said that Muslims in Hamtramck \u201chave helped bring stability, security and sobriety while lessening the amount of drugs and crime in the city.\u201d\n\nIf they are in Michigan legally they need to follow our laws.
